Since the average peak humidity this August was three points higher than the average peak humidity last August, it follows that more energy was consumed in Millville this August than last August. Which one of the following arguments has a pattern of reasoning most similar to the one in the argument above? A: The amount of art supplies used in any of the Aesthetic Institute's 25 classes is directly proportional to the number of students in that class. Since in these classes the institute enrolled 20 percent more students overall last year than in the previous year, more art supplies were used in the institute's classes last year than in the previous year. B: The fees paid by a student at the Aesthetic Institute are directly proportional to the number of classes in which that student enrolls. Since the number of students at the Aesthetic Institute is increasing, it follows that the institute is collecting a greater amount if fees paid by students that it used to. C: The number of instructors employed by the Aesthetic Institute in any term is directly proportional to the number of classes offered in that term and also directly proportional to the number of students enrolled at the institute. Thus, the number of classes offered by the institute in any term is directly proportional to the number of students enrolled in that term. D: The number of new students enrolled at the Aesthetic Institute in any given year is directly proportional to the amount of advertising the institute has done in the previous year. Hence, if the institute seeks to increase its student body it must increase the amount it spends on advertising.

So if Sullivan does not get the contract and Perez does not get it either, then it will not be awarded to the lowest bidder. B: If the excavation contract does not go to the lowest bidder, then it will go to Caldwell. So if Qiu gets the contract and Caldwell does not, then the contract will have been awarded to the lowest bidder. C: If the lowest bidder on the sanitation contract is not Dillon, then it is Ramsey. So if the contract goes to the lowest bidder and it does not go to Dillon, then it will go to Ramsey. D: If Kapshaw is not awarded the landscaping contract, then Johnson will be.

Both times a weak pundra made Darfir' s manufactured products a bargain on world markets, and Darfir' s exports were up substantially. Now some politicians are saying that, in order to cause another similarly sized increase in exports, the government should allow the pundra to become weak again. Which of the following, if true, provides the government with the strongest grounds to doubt that the politicians' recommendation, if followed, will achieve its aim? A: Several of the politicians now recommending that the pundra be allowed to become weak made that same recommendation before each of the last two periods of currency weakness. B: A sharp improvement in the efficiency of Darfir's manufacturing plants would make Darfir's products a bargain on world markets even without any weakening of the pundra relative to other currencies.

It follows that in Sheldon most bicyclists who have lights on their bicycles are at least 18 years old. Which one of the following exhibits a pattern of flawed reasoning most similar to that in the argument above? A: Most of the people in Sheldon buy gasoline on Mondays only. But almost everyone in Sheldon buys groceries on Tuesdays only. It follows that fewer than half of the people in Sheldon buy gasoline on the same day on which they buy groceries. B: The Sheldon Library lent more books during the week after it began lending videos than it had in the entire preceding month. It follows that the availability of videos was responsible for the increase in the number of books lent. C: Most of the residents of Sheldon who voted in the last election are on the Conservative party's mailing list, whereas most of Sheldon's residents who did not vote are not on the list. It follows that most of the residents of Sheldon on the Conservative party's mailing list voted in the last election. D: In the county where Sheldon is located, every town that has two or more fire trucks has a town pool, whereas most towns that have fewer than two fire trucks do not have a town pool.

Nevertheless, customer reports of damaged items rose somewhat. Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain why acting on the consultants' recommendation failed to achieve its goal? A: TrueSave has lost some of its regular customers as a result of the high number of damaged items they received. B: The amount of packing material used in a carton does not significantly influence the ease with which a customer can unpack the package. C: The change in packing policy led to an increase in expenditure on packing material and labor. D: When packing material is compressed too densely, it loses some of its capacity to absorb shock.

For example, living near a nuclear power plant was judged a much greater risk by the survey respondents than it was by the experts. On the other hand, exposure to Xrays was judged a significantly lower risk by the survey respondents than it was by the experts. Psychologists have found that people tend to be more worried about risks they consider involuntary than about risks they consider voluntary. Thus the survey results were probably caused by the respondents' tendency to consider involuntary risks to be greater than they actually are. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? A: The survey's respondents did not include people living near nuclear power plants. B: Not all of the survey respondents considered living near a nuclear power plant to be a voluntary risk. C: It is not the case that involuntary risks are usually greater than voluntary risks.

Which one of the following arguments contains flawed reasoning parallel to that in the argument above? A: Mechanical translation from one language into another, not merely in narrow contexts such as airline reservations but generally, is clearly an idea whose time has come. Since experts have been working on the problem for 40 years, it is now time for the accumulated expertise to achieve a breakthrough.

C: It is apparent that consumers have tired of microwave ovens as quickly as they initially came to accept this recent invention. In contrast to several years of increasing sales following the introduction of microwave ovens, sales of microwave ovens flattened last year, indicating that consumers have found relatively little use for these devices. D: Sales of computers for home use will never reach the levels optimistically projected by manufacturers. The reason is that home use was envisioned as encompassing tasks, such as menu planning and checkbook reconciliation, that most homemakers perform in much simpler ways than using a computer would require.

The reasoning in the above argument most closely parallels that in which one of the following? A: An exhaustive search of the marshes last year revealed no sign of marsh hawks, so it can be assumed that a similar search this year would reveal equally little sign of that kind of bird. B: Before the banks raised their interest rates, people on average incomes could almost afford a mortgage for an amount twice their salary, hence the rate increase has now put mortgages beyond their reach. C: Since the improvement in the company's profitability began to occur after the vice president's new moralebuilding program was put in place, that program can be credited with the improved result.

Papers that result from international collaboration are cited an average of seven times, whereas papers with single authors are cited only three times on average. This difference shows that research projects conducted by international research teams are of greater importance than those conducted by single researchers. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? A: International research teams tend to be more generously funded than are single researchers. B: It is possible to ascertain whether or not a paper is the product of international collaboration by determining the number of citations it has received. C: The number of citations a paper receives is a measure of the importance of the research it reports.

The conclusion of the editorialist's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? A: Whatever is true of money is true of financial markets generally. B: If everyone believes in something, then that thing exists. C: Only if one can have mistaken beliefs about a thing does that thing exist, strictly speaking.

For example, penguins and ostriches use their wings to move in a different way from other birds. Penguins use their wings only to swim under water at high speeds. Ostriches use their wings only to run with the wind by lifting them as if they were sails. Which one of the following is most parallel in its reasoning to the argument above? A: Ancient philosophers tried to explain not how the world functions but why it functions. In contrast, most contemporary biologists seek comprehensive theories of how organisms function, but many refuse to speculate about purpose. B: Some chairs are used only as decorations, and other chairs are used only to tame lions. Ttherefore, not all chairs are used for sitting in despite the fact that all chairs have a seat and some support such as legs. C: Sailing ships move in a different way from steamships. Both sailing ships and steamships navigate over water, but only sailing ships use sails to move over the surface.

In teaching mathematics, for example, arithmetic must precede calculus. Thus, the hierarchy in lecturing is a strength. The respondent's reply to the debater's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the respondent A: takes for granted that the conceptual structure of mathematics is sufficiently representative of the conceptual structure of at least some other academic disciplines B: fails to consider the possibility that some characteristics of lecturing other than hierarchy are weaknesses C: concedes one of the major assumptions on which the debater's argument depends D: applies a key concept to a different aspect of education than the aspect to which the debater applied it Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"D"},{"instruction":"The report released by the interior ministry states that within the past 5 years the national landreclamation program has resulted in a 19 percent increase in the amount of arable land within the country.

A: Moira, after observing the finish of the 60kilometer bicycle race, reports that Lee won with Adams a distant third. Lomas, a bicycle engineering expert, insists, however, that Lee could not have won a race in which Adams competed; so Moira's report cannot be true. B: Amos claims that he can hold his breath under water for a full hour. Dr. Treviso, a cardiopulmonary specialist, has stated that humans are physiologically incapable of holding their breath for even half that long; so Amos' claim cannot be true.

Which one of the following inferences is most strongly supported by the information above? A: Attaching a reliable date to any event requires determining which of several conflicting chronologies is most likely to be true. B: The soundest approach to dating an event for which the usual sources give conflicting chronologies is to undermine the credibility of as many of these sources as possible. C: Some of the events for which there are conflicting chronologies and for which attempts have been made by historians to determine the right date cannot be dated reliably by historians.

Since no abstract painting will be included in next week's art auction, nothing to be included in next week's art auction is a painting in the Huang Collection. B: All of the paintings in the Huang Collection are superb works of art. Since none of the paintings in the Huang Collection is by Roue, it stands to reason that no painting by Roue is a superb work of art. C: Every painting from the Huang Collection that is to be auctioned off next week is a major work of art. No price can adequately reflect the true value of a major work of art. Hence the prices that will be paid at next week's auction will not adequately reflect the true value of the paintings sold.

In consequence, the airport would be able to accommodate 10 percent fewer flights than currently use the airport daily. The city's operating budget depends heavily on taxes generated by tourist spending, and most of the tourists come by plane. Ttherefore, the proposed new safety rules, if adopted, will reduce the revenue available for the operating budget. The argument depends on assuming which of the following? A: Few, if any, of the tourists who use the Beach City airport do so when their main destination is a neighboring community and not Beach City itself. B: If the proposed safety rules are adopted, the reduction in tourist numbers will not result mainly from a reduction in the number of tourists who spend relatively little in Beach City.

Those excess calories produce excess weight. The passage above best supports which one of the following conclusions about people who diet to lose weight? A: They are bound to end up weighing more than when they started dieting. B: They must not go back to eating prediet amounts of food if they are to maintain their weight at the reduced level resulting from dieting.

The structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in which one of the following? A: Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win longdistance races. Some longdistance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; ttherefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary. B: Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds. Hence, not all inedible and nonornamental plants are weeds. C: Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes.

Aside from seed production, these selfpollinating primroses are indistinguishable from nonselfpollinating primroses. Nevertheless, selfpollinating primrose plants remain rare among primroses. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above? A: Selfpollinating primroses that are located in areas with few insects produce no fewer seeds than do selfpollinating primroses that are located in areas with many insects. B: When insect pollinators are scarce, nonself pollinating primroses produce larger seeds that are more likely to germinate than are seeds from selfpollinating primroses. C: Selfpollinating primroses can be assisted by insects during pollination but do not require the assistance of insects to be pollinated. D: Many primroses are located in areas in which the soil conditions that are optimal for seed germination are not present.

But if the company decides to stay where it is now, it will lose a number of employees, since many employees are unhappy in this location. So the company will lose employees no matter what it decides. B: If the city council approves a small increase in property taxes, there will be enough money to restore the city swimming pools in Rice Park. If the city council approves a large increase in property taxes, there will be enough money to restore the city swimming pools and build a recreational center in Rice Park. Either way, the city will make progress in improving the facilities in Rice Park. C: If Chen supports building a new art center, the center will be built. If Chen opposes building a new art center, the center will not be built. So whether or not a new art center will be built depends on Chen's decision.

In this time, the number of wood bison has tripled and, according to conservationists, this number is enough for a species to remain viable in the wild. Yet since the wood bison's habitat is still imperiled, conservationists plan to move the wood bison 2, 000 miles away, where the American buffalo, a distinct species, flourishes. The conservationists predict that such a plan will allow for the longterm viability of the wood bison as a species. Which of the following, if true, calls into question the conservationist's prediction? A: No wood bison has ever been within 1, 000 miles of the area in which the conservationists are planning to move the herd.

The principle above, if valid, most strongly supports which one of the following arguments? A: The piece of art in the lobby is clearly not classified as truly great, so it follows that it fails to be original. B: Some of the most original art being produced today is found in isolated communities, but because of this isolation these works have only minor influence, and hence cannot be considered truly great. C: Since Bach's music is truly great, it not only has both originality and a major influence on musicians, it has broad popular appeal as well. D: By breaking down traditional schemes of representation, Picasso redefined painting. It is this extreme originality that warrants his work being considered truly great.

Although some archeologists believe that the first paintings were actually made to illustrate the plight of starving prehistoric man during the dry season, these early painters must have first discovered the ability to mix minerals to make paint colors. These complex experimentations were the result of a dedication to the study of fine arts. The argument leads to the conclusion that A: prehistoric man could have accidentally discovered how to mix minerals to make paint colors B: the study of fine art began in societies that at some time had abundant food, shelter, and water C: whenever people have food, shelter, and water, they will dedicate themselves to the study of fine arts D: the study of fine art cannot be done unless one has the ability to mix minerals to make paint colors Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"B"},{"instruction":"The only vehicles that have high resale values are those that are well maintained.

This would, however, be a temporary solution at best: if the population continues to double every 30 years, and if in the year 2500 half of Earth' s population emigrated to Mars, then by the year 2530 Earth would be just as crowded as it had been before the emigration. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion drawn in the essayist's argument? A: Learning how to colonize other planets would, at best, be a temporary solution to the overcrowding of Earth. B: The population of Earth's surface will probably continue to grow geometrically even if temporary solutions to population growth, such as colonizing other planets, are adopted.

But the comparatively high number of warrior tombs found in recent excavations of the same tribes' late Bronze Age settlements indicates that in the late Bronze Age, wars between these tribes were frequent, and the casualty rate was high. Hence some archaeologists claim that by the late Bronze Age, these tribes had developed new methods of warfare designed to inflict many casualties. Which one of the following, if true, most supports the archaeologists' claim? A: Some tombs of warriors dating to the late Bronze Age contain armor and weapons that anthropologists believe were trophies taken from enemies in battle. B: A royal tomb dating to the early Bronze Age contained pottery depicting battle scenes in which warriors use spears. C: Scenes of violent warfare, painted in bright hues, frequently appear on pottery that has been found in some early Bronze Age tombs of warriors.

But it would be a mistake to conclude that these problems are caused by the difficulty the children have adjusting to divorce. It is just as reasonable to infer that certain behaviors that increase the likelihood of divorce hostility, distrust, lack of empathy are learned by children from their parents, and that it is these learned behaviors, rather than the difficulty of adjusting to divorce, that cause the children' s psychological problems. The assertion that children of divorced parents have a higher rate of psychological problems than other children figures in the argument in which one of the following ways? A: It is offered as evidence for the claim that certain behaviors are often responsible for divorce. B: It is the claim that the argument tries to refute.

A modern reader might interpret Newton' s famous comment, if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants, as a conciliatory gesture acknowledging indebtedness to Hooke and other contemporary scientists for some of his theories. Conciliatory gestures acknowledging indebtedness were uncharacteristic of Newton, however, and in his day such allusions to giants typically referred to the ancient Greeks, not to contemporary scientists. The statements in the passage, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? A: Newton did not believe that any of Hooke's theories of light were based on those of the ancient Greeks. B: Newton did not intend the quoted comment to be an acknowledgment that his theories of light were largely derived from Hooke's. C: Newton was not familiar with Hooke's work on the theory of light.

It received most of its support that year in rural and semirural areas, where the bulk of Banestria' s population lived at the time. The economic woes of the years surrounding that election hit agricultural and small business interests the hardest, and the Land Party specifically targeted those groups in 1935. I conclude that the success of the Land Party that year was due to the combination of the Land Party' s specifically addressing the concerns of these groups and the depth of the economic problems people in these groups were facing. Each of the following, if true, strengthens the historian's argument EXCEPT: A: Voters are more likely to vote for a political party that focuses on their problems. B: In preceding elections the Land Party made no attempt to address the interests of economically distressed urban groups. C: The greater the degree of economic distress someone is in, the more likely that person is to vote.

The reasoning in the television host's argument is flawed in that the argument A: presupposes as evidence the conclusion that it is trying to establish B: confuses legal standards for guilt with moral standards for guilt C: places undue reliance on the judgments of an authority figure D: takes lack of evidence for a view as grounds for concluding that the view is false Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"C"},{"instruction":"Most opera singers who add demanding roles to their repertoires at a young age lose their voices early. It has been said that this is because their voices have not yet matured and hence lack the power for such roles. But young singers with great vocal power are the most likely to ruin their voices. The real problem is that most young singers lack the technical training necessary to avoid straining their vocal cords especially when using their full vocal strength. Such misuse of the cords inevitably leads to a truncated singing career. Which one of the following does the information above most strongly support? A: Young opera singers without great vocal power are unlikely to ruin their voices by singing demanding roles. B: Most young opera singers who sing demanding roles strain their vocal cords. C: Only mature opera singers can sing demanding roles without undue strain on their vocal cords. D: Some young opera singers ruin their voices while singing demanding roles because their vocal cords have not yet matured.

But the company reasons that it will be able to lower its prices because, in a weakenedeconomy, other ecofriendly plastic manufacturers are likely to fail. Demand among manufacturers for recyclable plastics as raw materials would then plummet, creating an oversupply of such materials, making them less expensive for the manufacturer to purchase and thus lowering the company' s costs. Which of the following, if true, most weakens the company's reasoning? A: Retailers, including retailers that cater to consumers seeking certain types of ecofriendly products, may lose some business if economic conditions worsen. B: Smaller ecofriendly plastic manufacturers are more likely to fail in a weakened economy than larger ecofriendly manufacturers are. C: The plastics used by the company in its products were, after a recent investigation by a regulatory body, declared to be safe for consumers.

The producer's conclusion is properly inferred if which one of the following is assumed? A: If there is neither government censorship nor boycotting of advertisers, there will be no restriction of the television shows that the public can watch. B: Public boycotts could force some shows off the air even though the shows neither promote violence nor erode values.

The reasoning in the community organizer's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument A: defines a term in such a way as to ensure that whatever the outcome, it will be considered a positive outcome B: confuses a condition that is required for an outcome with one that is sufficient for that outcome C: takes for granted that people who participated in last year's cleanup will participate this year D: generalizes about the outcome of an event based on a single observation of a similar situation Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"D"},{"instruction":"Fossilfuel producers say that it would be prohibitively expensive to reduce levels of carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels enough to halt global warming. This claim is probably false. Several years ago, the chemical industry said that finding an economical alternative to the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) destroying the ozone layer would be impossible. Yet once the industry was forced, by international agreements, to find substitutes for CFCs, it managed to phase them out completely well before the mandated deadline, in many cases at a profit. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? A: There are ways of reducing carbon dioxide emissions that could halt global warming without hurting profits of fossilfuel producers significantly more than phasing out CFCs hurt those of the chemical industry. B: The use of CFCs never contributed as greatly to the destruction of the ozone layer as the carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels currently contributes to global warming. C: In some countries, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels has already been reduced without prohibitive expense, but at some cost in convenience to the users of such fuels.

According to one hypothesis, dreams are produced when the brain is erasing parasitic connections (meaningless, accidental associations between ideas), which accumulate during the day and which would otherwise clog up our memories. Interestingly, the only mammal that does not have rapid eye movement sleep, in which we humans typically have our most vivid dreams, is the spiny anteater, which has been seen as anomalous in that it has a very large brain relative to the animal' s size. This fact provides some confirmation for the parasiticconnection hypothesis, since the hypothesis predicts that for an animal that did not dream to have an effective memory that animal would need extra memory space for the parasitic connections. The parasiticconnection hypothesis, if true, most strongly supports which one of the following?

Despite heavy marketing, the new sandwich accounts for a very small proportion of the chain's sales. The sandwich's sales would have to quadruple to cover the costs associated with including it on the menu. Since such an increase is unlikely, the chain would be more profitable if it dropped the sandwich. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: An attempt by the chain to introduce a lowerfat hamburger failed several years ago, since it attracted few new customers and most of the chain's regular customers greatly preferred the taste of the regular hamburger. B: Although many of the chain's customers have never tried the vegetarian sandwich, in a market research survey most of those who had tried it reported that they were very satisfied with it. C: Many of the people who eat at the chain's restaurants also eat at the restaurants of competing chains and report no strong preference among the competitors.

This result is consistent with other studies, which show that those who have heart disease often have higher than average cholesterol levels. This shows that lowering cholesterol levels reduces the risk of heart disease. The argument's reasoning is flawed because the argument A: fails to consider that pravastatin may reduce the risk of heart disease but not as a consequence of its lowering cholesterol levels B: relies on past findings, rather than drawing its principal conclusion from the data found in the specific study cited C: neglects the possibility that pravastatin may have severe side effects D: draws a conclusion regarding the effects of lowering cholesterol levels on heart disease, when in fact the conclusion should focus on the relation between pravastatin and cholesterol levels Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"A"},{"instruction":"On completing both the course in experimental design and the developmental psychology course, Angela will have earned a degree in psychology.

Scientists theorize that the more genetically similar two species are to each other, the more recently they diverged from a common ancestor. After comparing genetic material from giant pandas, red pandas, raccoons, coatis, and all seven bear species, scientists concluded that bears and raccoons diverged 30 to 50 million years ago. They further concluded that red pandas separated from the ancestor of today' s raccoons and coatis a few million years later, some 10 million years before giant pandas diverged from the other bears. Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage? A: Giant pandas and red pandas are more closely related than scientists originally thought they were.

Within several generations, the wild radishes began to show the same flower color as the domesticated ones. This suggests that resistance to pesticides, which is often a genetically engineered trait, would also be passed from domesticated crop plants to their relatives that are considered weeds. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the botanist's argument? A: It is more difficult for flower color to be transferred between domesticated and wild radishes than it is for almost any other trait to be passed between any two similarly related plant species. B: When the ratio of domesticated radishes to wild radishes in the field increased, the speed with which the flower color passed to the wild radishes also increased. C: Radishes are not representative of crop plants in general with respect to the ease with which various traits are passed among members of closely related species.

During the same period, crop loss from insects has approximately doubled, from about seven to thirteen percent. Which one of the following, if true, contributes most to explaining the paradoxical findings above? A: Extension agents employed by state governments to advise farmers have recently advocated using smaller amounts of pesticide, though in past years they promoted heavy pesticide use. B: While pesticideresistant strains of insects were developing, crop rotation, which for insects disrupts a stable food supply, was gradually abandoned because farmers' eligibility to receive government crop subsidies depended on continuing to plant the same crop.

But since South Island tuatara were thought to be of the same species as North Island tuatara there was no need to protect them. But new research indicates that the South Island tuatara are a distinct species, found only in that location. Because it is now known that if the South Island tuatara are lost an entire species will thereby be lost, human beings are now obliged to prevent their extinction, even if it means killing many of their unendangered natural predators. Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the naturalists' argumentation? A: In order to maximize the number of living things on Earth, steps should be taken to preserve all local populations of animals. B: Human activities that either intentionally or unintentionally threaten the survival of an animal species ought to be curtailed. C: The threat of local extinction imposes no obligation to try to prevent that extinction, whereas the threat of global extinction does impose such an obligation.

A number of ringtail opossums that had been orphaned and subsequently raised in captivity were monitored after being returned to the wild. Seventyfive percent of those opossums were killed by foxes, a species not native to Australia. Conservationists concluded that the native ringtail opossum population was endangered not by a scarcity of food, as had been previously thought, but by nonnative predator species against which the opossum had not developed natural defenses. Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conservationists' argument? A: Ringtail opossums that grow to adulthood in the wild defend themselves against foxes no more successfully than do ringtail opossums raised in captivity. B: Foxes, which were introduced into Australia over 200 years ago, adapted to the Australian climate less successfully than did some other foreign species. C: The ringtail opossums that were raised in captivity were fed a diet similar to that which ringtail opossums typically eat in the wild.

Which one of the following conforms most closely to the principle illustrated by the statements above? A: By spending more on zoo maintenance, a city increases the number of zoo patrons. The extra revenue generated by the sale of memorabilia more than makes up for the extra costs of maintenance. B: Road taxes are raised to encourage more people to use mass transit. But since the fee paid by each commuter does not equal the cost of providing transit for that commuter, a mass transit service will deteriorate even as it takes in more money.

One question was: Which do you think about more: politics or the joy of earning money? This question is clearly biased. Also, the readers of the magazine are a selfselecting sample. Thus, there is reason to be skeptical about the conclusion drawn in the magazine' s survey. Each of the following, if true, would strengthen the statistician's argument EXCEPT: A: Other surveys suggest that North Americans are just as concerned about politics as they are about finances. B: The conclusions drawn in most magazine surveys have eventually been disproved.

Reliable xray and chemical tests show that the red pigment was applied after the painting had been completed, and that the red paint was not mixed in Veronese' s workshop. Hence it appears likely that an artist other than Veronese tampered with Veronese' s painting after its completion. Art critic: But in a copy of Veronese' s painting made shortly after Veronese died, the cloak is red. It is highly unlikely that a copyist would have made so major a change so soon after Veronese' s death. The assertion that a later artist tampered with Veronese's painting serves which one of the following functions in the curator's argument? A: It is a clarification of a key term of the argument. B: It is a particular instance of the general position to be defended. C: It is a subsidiary conclusion that supports the argument's main conclusion.

Which of the following, if true, does most to explain the contrast described above? A: Except during periods of extreme drought, algae levels tend to be higher in rivers in which the flow has been controlled by damming than in rivers that flow freely. B: Australian rivers dry up completely for short intervals in periods of extreme drought. C: During periods of extreme drought, the populations of some of the species that feed on algae tend to fall.

Clearly, then, many more people are interested in lengthy televised political messages than was previously thought. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: The candidate who produced the halfhourlong advertisement did not win election at the polls. B: In general a regularlength television program that features debate about current political issues depends for its appeal on the personal qualities of the program's moderator.

Which one of the following, if true, most calls into question the officials' argument? A: The owls whose nesting sites are currently being destroyed by the gray squirrels feed primarily on rodents. B: The officials' plan entails adding the poison to food sources that are usually eaten by rodents but not by other animals.

Business schools seem unable, on their own, to tear themselves away from their largely academic roots and move closer to the realities of today' s business and industry; too often, trainees in business schools find themselves studying hypothetical cases instead of real ones. Furthermore, business schools have been slow to respond to the needs of business. Ttherefore, business schools should allow business executives to set curricula for management trainees that could then be taught by academics. The argument relies on which one of the following assumptions? A: Academics in business schools deal only with hypothetical situations in their business case studies.

Bipedalism would have allowed early hominids to see over tall grasses, helping them to locate food and to detect and avoid predators. However, because bipedalism also would have conferred substantial advantages upon early hominids who never left the forest in gathering food found within standing reach of the forest floor, for example debate continues concerning its origins. It may even have evolved, like the upright threat displays of many large apes, because it bettered an individual' s odds of finding a mate. Which one of the following statements is most supported by the information above? A: Bipedal locomotion would have helped early hominids gather food. B: For early hominids, forest environments were generally more hospitable than grassland environments.

The predominant theory about northern cave paintings was that they were largely a description of the current diets of the painters. This theory cannot be right, because the painters must have needed to eat the sea animals populating the waters north of Norway if they were to make the long journey to and from the islands, and there are no paintings that unambiguously depict such creatures. Each of the following, if true, weakens the argument against the predominant theory about northern cave paintings EXCEPT: A: Parts of the cave paintings on the islands did not survive the centuries. B: The cave paintings that were discovered on the islands depicted many land animals. C: The cave paintings on the islands were done by the original inhabitants of the islands who ate the meat of land animals. D: Once on these islands, the cave painters hunted and ate land animals.

Measures taken to clean up the river must be working, though, since this year the Lalolah River is ranked as only the third most polluted river in the district. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument A: equates a decrease relative to the other ranked rivers with an absolute decrease B: interprets lack of evidence for a claim as support for an opposing claim C: confuses the state of the individual rivers in the water district with that of the water district as a whole D: does not disclose the basis for the ranking used Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"A"},{"instruction":"John wants to win the annual Mayfield raffle next year because he needs the Mayfield raffle' s prize. If he enters more than one raffle next year, the likelihood of his winning one of them would be greater than if he entered only a single raffle.

Q was not murdered with a sharp blade, so suspect X's butter knife may have been the murder weapon. C: Higher grades lead to better job opportunities, and studying leads to higher grades. Ttherefore, studying will lead to better job opportunities. D: The only times that the hospital's emergency room staff attends to relatively less serious emergencies are times when there is no critical emergency to attend to.

This implies that it is possible to place a numerical value on such things as health and emotional wellbeing; but trying to put a numerical value on such things is nonsense. Thus, the quality of a life cannot be measured in this way. B: Some statisticians predict future events by observing past events; this requires extrapolating from the past. Though it is impossible to make completely accurate predictions through extrapolation, many predictions can be made with at least a reasonable degree of confidence.

This might lead one to expect fractures to develop at highstress points. Surprisingly, however, fractures develop not at highstress points but elsewhere on the bridge. Which one of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of why bridges fracture elsewhere than at highstress points? A: Structures with no highstress points can nonetheless have a high probability of fracturing. B: Fractures do not develop at highstress points, because bridges are reinforced at those points; however, stress is transferred to other points on the bridge where it causes fractures. C: In many structures, the process of fracturing often causes highstress points to develop.

This reduction resulted in a significant increase in Argonia' s exports over 1982 levels. In 1987 a similar reduction in the value of the argon led to another increase in Argonia' s exports. Faced with the need to increase exports yet again, Argonia' s finance minister has proposed another reduction in the value of the argon. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the prediction that the finance minister's plan will not result in a significant increase in Argonia's exports next year? A: The value of the argon rose sharply last year against the world's strongest currencies.

Halophytes require more water than conventional crops, but can be irrigated with seawater, and pumping seawater into farms near sea level is much cheaper than pumping freshwater from deep wells. Thus, seawater agriculture near sea level should be costeffective in desert regions although its yields are smaller than traditional, freshwater agriculture. Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above? A: Costs other than the costs of irrigation are different for halophytes grown by means of seawater irrigation than for conventional crops. B: Large research expenditures are needed to develop the strains of halophytes best suited for agricultural purposes.

Bumblebees visit both species, creating the potential for interactions between the two species with respect to pollination. In a recent study, researchers selected 16 plots containing both species; all dandelions were removed from eight plots; the remaining eight control plots were left undisturbed. The control plots yielded significantly more larkspur seeds than the dandelionfree plots, leading the researchers to conclude that the presence of dandelions facilitates pollination (and hence seed production) in the native species by attracting more pollinators to the mixed plots. Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the researchers' reasoning? A: Bumblebees preferentially visit dandelions over larkspurs in mixed plots. B: Soil disturbances can result in fewer blooms, and hence lower seed production. C: If left unchecked, nonnative species like dandelions quickly crowd out native species.

Ttherefore, since throbbing in the teeth or gums is a sign of serious dental problems, and neither Sabina' s teeth nor her gums are throbbing, Sabina can be suffering from neither tooth decay nor gum disease. Which one of the following contains an error of reasoning most similar to that made in the argument above? A: Someone who is neither an ophthalmologist nor an optometrist lacks specialized training for diagnosing defects of the eye. Ttherefore, Kim must have been trained in ophthalmology or optometry, given that she accurately diagnosed John's eye defect. B: A legally practicing psychiatrist must have both a medical degree and psychiatric training. Thus, since Emmett has not undergone psychiatric training, if he is practicing as a psychiatrist, he is not doing so legally. C: People who drink a lot of coffee are said to have jittery nerves. Ttherefore, medical students who drink a lot of coffee should not become neonatologists or surgeons since neither neonatology nor surgery should be practiced by people with jittery nerves.

A: Parents who never punish a child are not justified in complaining if the child regularly behaves in ways that disturb them. But many parents who prefer not to punish their children complain regularly about their children's behavior. Hence, many parents who complain about their children have no right to complain.

After all, the first sound heard within the womb is the comforting sound of the mother' s regular heartbeat. So in taking away from us the warmth and security of the womb, birth also takes away a primal and constant source of comfort. Thus it is extremely natural that in seeking sensations of warmth and security throughout life, people would be strongly drawn toward simple recurring rhythmic sounds. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the reasoning above? A: The comforting sound of the mother's regular heartbeat is the first sound that is heard inside the womb. B: Birth deprives us of a primal and constant source of comfort when it takes away the warmth and security of the womb. C: People seek sensations of warmth and security throughout life because birth takes away the warmth and security of the womb. D: The explanation of the strong primordial appeal of music with a simple recurring rhythm is that it reminds us of the womb environment.

Clearly, support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? A: The members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group. B: Some physicians have argued that attending weekly support group meetings gives patients less faith in the standard treatment for disease T.

This year, however, the weather was unusually cool into late June, and ttherefore the fact that these snap peas were planted in midMay is unlikely to result in crop failure despite the experts' warnings. The pattern of reasoning displayed above is most closely paralleled in which one of the following? A: Since African violets do not thrive in direct sunlight, it is said that in this region these plants should be placed in windows facing north rather than south; however, since these southfacing windows are well shaded by evergreen trees, the African violets placed in them are likely to grow satisfactorily. B: House plants generally grow best in pots slightly larger than their existing root systems, so the usual advice is to repot when roots first reach the sides of the pot; this rule should not be followed with amaryllis plants, however, because they are likely to do best with tightly compressed roots. C: Where flowers are to be planted under shade trees, gardening experts often advise using impatiens since impatiens does well in conditions of shade; however, it is unlikely to do well under maple trees since maple tree roots are so near the surface that they absorb all available moisture. D: According to many gardening authorities, tomatoes should not be planted near dill because doing so is likely to affect their taste adversely; however, since these tomatoes were grown near dill and taste fine, there is clearly no reason to pay much attention to the socalled experts' advice.

It lasts for only half as many viewings as the old kind does but costs a third as much. Ttherefore, video rental stores would find it significantly more economical to purchase and stock movies recorded on the new kind of videocassette than on the old kind. Anna: But the videocassette itself only accounts for 5 percent of the price a video rental store pays to buy a copy of a movie on video; most of the price consists of royalties the store pays to the studio that produced the movie. So the price that video rental stores pay per copy would decrease by considerably less than 5 percent, and royalties would have to be paid on additional copies. Anna's reply is structured to lead to which one of the following conclusions? A: The largest part of the fee a customer pays to rent a movie from a video rental store goes toward the royalties the store paid in purchasing that movie. B: If the price a video rental store pays to buy a movie on videocassette does not decrease, the rental fee the store charges on the movie will not decrease. C: The cost savings to video rental stores that buy movies recorded on the cheaper videocassettes rather than movies recorded on the more durable ones will be small or nonexistent. D: Video rental stores should always stock the highestquality videocassettes available, because durability is more important than price.

Although every person' s DNA is unique, DNA tests often fail to distinguish among DNA samples taken from distinct individuals. Hence, it is a mistake to exonerate a suspect simply because that person' s DNA did not match the DNA samples taken from the scene of the crime. Which one of the following is an error in the reasoning above? A: It confuses a test that incorrectly identifies DNA samples as coming from the same person with a test that incorrectly shows as coming from different persons samples that come from a single person. B: It relies on experimental data derived from DNA testing that have not been shown to hold under nonexperimental conditions. C: It generalizes about the reliability of all methods used to identify those involved in the commission of a crime on the basis of results that pertain to only a few such methods.

This trust increases my enjoyment of a good novel. Peter Lee' s second novel is set in San Francisco. In this novel, as in his first, Lee passes my test with flying colors. Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage? A: Peter Lee's first novel was set in San Francisco. B: The book reviewer enjoys virtually any novel written by a novelist whom she trusts. C: The book reviewer does not trust any novel set in a city that she does not know well. D: The book reviewer does not believe that she knows San Francisco better than Peter Lee does.

A classic suit may stay in style for as long as five years, so it is worthwhile to pay more to get a wellconstructed one. A trendy hat that will go out of style in a year or two should be purchased as cheaply as possible. Which one of the following most accurately expresses the principle underlying the reasoning above? A: One should not buy a cheaply made garment when a wellconstructed garment is available. B: Formal attire tends to be designed and constructed to last longer than casual attire. C: The amount of money one spends on a garment should be roughly proportionate to the length of time one plans to keep wearing it. D: The amount of money one spends on clothing should be roughly the same whether one is purchasing men's or women's attire.

During this time, the silvertail fox, a popular target for hunters, has seen a marked decrease in population. Ttherefore, to prevent the population of silvertail foxan important apex predator responsible for keeping the Deersdale County's rabbit population in checkfrom falling even lower, the state should once again place strict sanctions against hunting. Which of the following, if true, most strongly suggests that stricter sanctions against hunting would not have the desired effect? A: The silvertail fox had been experiencing a population surge shortly before the state sanctions against hunting were eased. B: The number of hunters entering the park is expected to drop drastically in the next few months as hunting season comes to an end.

Burnt lichen and grass have been found in many Neanderthal fireplaces. A fire of lichen and grass produces a lot of smoke but does not produce nearly as much heat or light as a wood fire. Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the archaeologist's argument? A: In close proximity to the fireplaces with lichen and grass are other fireplaces that, evidence suggests, burned material that produced more heat than smoke. B: Some of the fireplaces containing burnt lichen are in regions in which lichen is not believed to have been plentiful and so would have had to have been brought in from some distance. C: In the region containing the Neanderthal fireplaces in which lichen and grass were burnt, no plants that could be burned more effectively to produce heat or light were available 60, 000 years ago. D: There is clear evidence that at least some groups of Neanderthals living more recently than 60, 000 years ago developed methods of preserving meat other than smoking it.

A: approximately 5, 000 fires per year have been attributed to children playing with lighters before the safety levers were required B: unlike childresistant lighters, lighters that are not childresistant can be operated by children as young as two years old C: many of the fires started by young children are quickly detected and extinguished by their parents D: adults are more likely to leave childresistant lighters than nonchildresistant lighters in places that are accessible to children Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.","output":"D"},{"instruction":"Plankton generally thrive in areas of the ocean with sufficient concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds near the surface, where plankton live. Nevertheless, some areas, though rich in these nitrogen compounds, have few plankton. These areas have particularly low concentrations of iron, and oceanographers hypothesize that this shortage of iron prevents plankton from thriving. However, an experimental release of iron compounds into one such area failed to produce a thriving plankton population, even though local iron concentrations increased immediately. Which of the following, if true, argues most strongly against concluding, on the basis of the information above, that the oceanographers' hypothesis is false? A: Certain areas of the ocean support an abundance of plankton despite having particularly low concentrations of iron. B: A few days after the iron compounds were released, ocean currents displaced the ironrich water from the surface. C: The iron compounds released into the area occur naturally in areas of the ocean where plankton thrive. D: Not all of the nitrogen compounds that are sometimes found in relatively high concentrations in the oceans are nutrients for plankton.

Although some of the sugar in the grapes is caramelized in the process, nothing is added. Moreover, the only thing removed from the grapes is the water that evaporates during the drying, and water contains no calories or nutrients. The fact that raisins contain more iron per calorie than grapes do is thus puzzling. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why raisins contain more iron per calorie than do grapes? A: The body can absorb iron and other nutrients more quickly from grapes than from raisins because of the relatively high water content of grapes. B: Raisins are often eaten in combination with other ironcontaining foods, while grapes are usually eaten by themselves. C: Since grapes are bigger than raisins, it takes several bunches of grapes to provide the same amount of iron as a handful of raisins does. D: Caramelized sugar cannot be digested, so its calories do not count toward the calorie content of raisins.
