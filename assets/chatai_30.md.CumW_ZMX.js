Consider whether a medical reason might be at work. Understand the impact of picky eating.","output":"When it comes to feeding our furry friends, we all want to ensure that they are receiving the necessary nutrients to keep them healthy and happy. However, sometimes it can feel like your dog is intentionally ignoring their food, leaving you feeling frustrated and unsure of what to do next. Before you jump to conclusions or become too concerned, it's important to realize that your dog may simply be a picky eater by choice. There are a few reasons why dogs may become picky eaters. It's possible that they may have a medical issue that is causing them to lose their appetite, such as dental problems or gastrointestinal issues. If your dog suddenly becomes picky or refuses to eat, it's worth getting them checked out by a veterinarian to rule out any underlying health concerns. Another reason why dogs may become picky eaters is due to their unique preferences. Just like humans, dogs have individual tastes and may not like certain flavors or textures. It's important to pay attention to your dog's behavior and preferences when it comes to their food. If they consistently turn their nose up at a certain type of food, it's worth trying something different to see if they respond better. The impact of picky eating can vary depending on the severity of the issue. If your dog is only mildly picky, it may not have a significant impact on their health. However, if they aren't getting the necessary nutrients they need or consistently refuse to eat, it can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, and other health problems. In conclusion, it's important to understand that picky eating in dogs is not uncommon and can often be resolved with a little patience and experimentation. If you notice a sudden change in your dog's eating habits or are concerned about their overall health, it's always best to seek the advice of a veterinarian. By paying attention to your dog's preferences and needs, you can ensure that they are getting the proper nutrition they need to live a long and healthy life."},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: By MICHAEL HILL (AP) Americans are more calorieconscious and holding the line on weight gain after years of expanding waistlines, according to a market survey released Wednesday, but nutrition experts were wary of the findings.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

This can be difficult, especially if you are empathetic or sensitive to the feelings of those around you. However, it's crucial to your own mental and emotional well-being to maintain a level of detachment. One key aspect of avoiding catching the negative mood or emotions of others is to try not to take it personally. Recognize that the other person's mood likely has nothing to do with you, and focus on being a supportive listener rather than reacting defensively. Taking things personally can only escalate the situation and make it harder to maintain a positive outlook. If you find yourself struggling to maintain a sense of detachment or if the situation becomes too overwhelming, it's perfectly acceptable to remove yourself from the situation. Take a step back, breathe deeply, and give yourself space to center your thoughts and emotions. This can help to prevent you from catching the negative mood and becoming overwhelmed by it. Above all, when dealing with the negative emotions of others, make your safety a priority. If you find yourself feeling threatened or in danger physically, do not hesitate to remove yourself from the situation and seek help from the appropriate authorities.

This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's instantaneous field. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a 180 degree change in phase. If the conductor is 1⁄4 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back. That means it has undergone a total 360 degree phase change, returning it to the original signal. The current in the element thus adds to the current being created from the source at that instant. This process creates a standing wave in the conductor, with the maximum current at the feed. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable.

In her view, Corinthian Colleges, one of the largest for-profit college networks in the United States, must shut down due to inflated job rates and low graduation rates. Barkley contends that for-profit colleges charge exorbitant tuition fees but fail to prepare students for the job market. Rather than providing students with valuable skills and knowledge, these colleges leave students with high levels of debt and no real career prospects. According to Barkley, for-profits target vulnerable groups such as minorities, females, veterans, and blue-collar students, and then rip them off. The closure of Corinthian Colleges is, for Barkley, a sign that the government is finally taking action against predatory for-profit institutions. For years, Barkley and other experts have criticized for-profit colleges for their unscrupulous practices, which prey on the disadvantaged and vulnerable. While some may argue that for-profit colleges offer students more flexible options for obtaining an education, Barkley emphasizes that it is essential to provide students with quality education that prepares them for the job market.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. These studies suggest that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to nonhuman stimuli. Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing nonhuman primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.

However, Brydson is not just a wealthy heiress, but a notable philanthropist who has dedicated her time and resources to helping indigenous charities across Canada. Through her private foundation, the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation, Brydson invests in initiatives that support the most vulnerable communities in Canada. Her focus on indigenous communities is particularly noteworthy, as these have historically been marginalized and under-resourced. Brydson's foundation has contributed to a range of projects that have made a difference in the lives of indigenous communities. One of the most notable is the Indigenous Innovation Initiative, which provides funding and support to indigenous innovators who are addressing critical social and environmental challenges faced by their communities. Another initiative supported by Brydson's foundation is the Couchiching Jubilee House, a center that provides transitional housing and support to indigenous women and their families. The center has been instrumental in helping women who may have experienced domestic violence, addiction, or homelessness, giving them a safe space to rebuild their lives. Brydson's philanthropy is a shining example of how the wealthy can use their resources to make a positive difference in society. She recognizes that her privilege comes with a responsibility to give back and make a significant impact in the world. As Brydson's name appears more frequently in the media, it's essential to recognize her philanthropic contributions and encourage others in her position to do the same. By investing in initiatives that support marginalized communities like indigenous peoples, we can create a more equitable society for all.

Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of BrunswickLüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland).

The cloak rooms are places where elected officials can relax, have discussions, sleep, and speak to reporters. Nunes' claim, if true, would be a severe violation of lawmakers' privacy and raise serious concerns about governmental overreach. Nunes is not the only one sounding the alarm. Other lawmakers and journalists have called for Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation or firing. The DOJ, for its part, has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, but the very idea that such a breach of privacy could occur is deeply troubling. The cloak rooms should be sanctuaries for lawmakers in which they can speak freely without fear of being monitored. If the allegations made by Nunes are accurate, then this safe environment has been violated. Such intrusion by the DOJ would set a dangerous precedent and raise the question of what other places in the Capitol or beyond have been bugged. If the DOJ is indeed spying on elected officials, it is a blatant attack on democracy and the integrity of the US political system. While it is vital to investigate possible threatening activity, monitoring elected officials without just cause is not acceptable. If the DOJ has wiretapped the phones in the cloak room, it must be held to account for its actions. Nunes' allegation is not something that can be swept under the rug quietly. Lawmakers must address it, investigate it thoroughly, and hold those who are responsible accountable.

This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes than their hair band predecessors. Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock, several, including Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden, were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal, while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock. However, all grunge bands shunned the macho, anthemic and fashionfocused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal.

However, a historic ruling by India’s Supreme Court has granted Hijras, or transgender individuals, the right to self-identify their gender, marking a crucial step towards equality and acceptance. Despite this significant milestone, activists have voiced concerns over conflicting judgments by the Supreme Court regarding the LGBTQ community as a whole. While this ruling is undoubtedly a positive development, the court’s rulings on transgenders and gay individuals seem to contradict each other, leaving the larger issue of equality and discrimination unresolved. Furthermore, India’s transgender community remains disproportionately vulnerable to HIV, despite its relatively small size. Reportedly, this is due to factors such as societal discrimination leading to a lack of proper healthcare and high-risk employment in the sex industry. As such, while the recent ruling is a welcome change, there is still much work to be done to address the ongoing discrimination and challenges faced by India’s transgender community. Overall, the recent acknowledgment of the rights of Hijras is a crucial step towards reducing discrimination and promoting equality in India.

At inception, the project was led by Pete Slaiby, a Shell executive who had previously worked in the North Sea.

The nitrogen content of plant tissues averages about 2%, while in fungi, animals, and bacteria it averages about 5% to 10%.

All animals' diets must provide sufficient amounts of the basic building blocks they need, up to the point where their particular biology can synthesize the rest. Animal tissue contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates (sugar, starch, and fiber), amino acids (in proteins), fatty acids (in lipids), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and so on.

Prater's kick, which came during a game against the Tennessee Titans, measured an incredible 64 yards. To put this in perspective, the average field goal attempt in the NFL is typically around 40 yards. So for Prater to make a field goal that was 24 yards longer than average is truly remarkable. Over the years, a number of other kickers have come close to breaking Prater's record. In fact, several of them have made field goals that were 63 yards long, just one yard shy of the record. But so far, nobody has been able to surpass Prater's incredible feat. Of course, it's worth noting that there are a lot of factors that can impact the length of a field goal. For example, the weather conditions, the altitude of the stadium, and the angle of the kick can all play a role. That's why Prater's record-breaking kick is so impressive - he was able to make it under less-than-ideal circumstances. Overall, while there have been plenty of impressive field goals made over the years, Prater's 64-yarder stands alone as the longest and most impressive in NFL history."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Jeff, Jum and Geoffrey will play football at the weekend after arranging the team and place..","output":"Person 1: Hey Jeff, have you planned anything for the weekend?

During his career, Peck received numerous accolades for his remarkable acting skills, including several Oscar nominations. Before 1947, Peck had already received two Oscar nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In this article, we will take a look at the films that earned Peck his first two Oscar nominations. The first film for which Peck received an Oscar nomination was \\"Keys to the Kingdom,\\" released in 1944. Directed by John M. Stahl, the film tells the story of an adventurous missionary named Father Francis Chisholm, played by Peck. The film received mixed reviews, but Peck's performance was widely acclaimed. His portrayal of Father Francis, a man who devotes his life to helping the poor, was praised for its sincerity and depth. Peck's performance in \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor, although he eventually lost to Bing Crosby. Peck's second Oscar nomination came in 1946 for his role in the film, \\"The Yearling\\". Directed by Clarence Brown, the film is a touching story of a young boy named Jody, played by Claude Jarman Jr., who adopts a fawn as a pet. Peck played the father of the boy, named Penny Baxter, who struggles to provide for his family in the Florida backwoods. Peck's performance was once again praised by critics, particularly for his portrayal of a rugged and hardworking man who is also loving and devoted to his family. Peck's performance in \\"The Yearling\\" earned him his second Oscar nomination for Best Actor, which he eventually won. In conclusion, Gregory Peck received two Oscar nominations for films released before 1947.

Familiarizing yourself with your particular concrete flooring is a great place to start. This will help you understand how the surface will react to the acid stain. There are several factors that can affect the way acid staining adheres to concrete surfaces. These can include the type of concrete used, as well as any coatings or sealers that have been applied previously. To ensure the best possible outcome, it is essential to understand these factors beforehand. Before applying an acid stain to your concrete flooring, it is recommended that you perform a water test to check whether a sealer has been applied previously. If the water beads on the surface, then it has been sealed. If it is absorbed quickly, then it is not sealed. If necessary, you may also need to modify your concrete surface before staining it. This can include grinding or sanding to remove surface imperfections, or filling any cracks or holes to ensure a smooth surface. Choosing the right concrete cleaner is also essential to ensuring a successful acid staining job. Consider using a pH-neutral cleaner to prepare the surface beforehand, and an acidic cleaner to help remove any residues or stains that may be present. Alternatively, an alkaline cleaner can also be used to neutralize any remaining acid after the staining process. To avoid staining other surfaces, it is important to mask any walls near your concrete floor. Once this is done, clean the surface thoroughly, removing any dirt or debris that may be present. Any caulk or mastic residue must also be removed for a clean surface. Finally, before applying the acid stain, do a final cleaning of the floor to ensure that it is completely free of any debris or marks.

It seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well. In one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers.

After all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very anticlimatic to say the least. There are also large narration scenes that take us inside the thinking of the terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it.

He was kept in captivity for two years before being brutally executed by ISIS in August 2014. Recently, new details have emerged about the horrific treatment he endured during his captivity. According to cellmates who were held with Foley, he was bound to a metal bar and hung upside down for days on end. This cruel treatment is just one example of the torture he endured at the hands of his captors. It has also been revealed that Foley was waterboarded, a form of torture that simulates drowning, which ISIS has admitted to. Foley's fellow prisoners have stated that Americans and Britons were treated the harshest because their countries have refused to pay large ransoms for hostages. Foley, a journalist from Rochester, New Hampshire, was treated particularly harshly. Foley's case highlights the ongoing issue of journalists being targeted in conflict zones. Journalists put their lives on the line to report the truth and shed light on important events happening around the world. However, they are often targeted by militant groups who see them as a threat. It is important for governments and organizations to take a strong stance against the kidnapping and torture of journalists. Ransoms only serve to fund terrorist organizations and often do not result in the safe release of hostages. Instead, efforts should be focused on finding and punishing those responsible for these heinous acts. In conclusion, James Foley's brutal treatment and murder at the hands of ISIS serves as a reminder of the dangers faced by journalists working in conflict zones. It is imperative that we continue to fight for the safety and protection of journalists around the world."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteenword sentence that describes all this data: Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport LOCATION Paracuellos de Jarama; Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport RUNWAY_LENGTH 3500.0","output":"Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport is located in Paracuellos de Jarama and has a runway length of 3500.0."},{"instruction":"Briefly summarize this sentence: a dispute has arisen in the lush black hills between american indians ' religious beliefs and the rights of recreational climbers who also want to use the devils tower national monument here .","output":"Dispute between American Indian religious beliefs and recreational climbers at Devils Tower National Monument in the Black Hills."},{"instruction":"We visited Taliesin West on a recent trip to AZ and really enjoyed the school children's tour.

Current guidelines calls for 'monitoring' health care workers and military personnel when they return, but not to quarantine them. Ebola can incubate in the human body for 21 days or more before a patients shows symptoms and can pass on the virus to others.","output":"CDC Considers Mandatory Quarantine for Health Workers Returning from Ebola-hit Areas The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are reevaluating their policies on health workers returning from countries affected by Ebola. The consideration comes in response to the Ebola case of Dr. Craig Spencer in New York, who tested positive after treating Ebola patients in Guinea. Previously, the CDC has called for health care workers returning from Liberia, Guinea, or Sierra Leone to be monitored for symptoms of Ebola for 21 days. However, a recent policy option is now being considered which could segregate returning health care workers in a mandatory quarantine for three weeks. The new policy involves a controversial 'forced quarantine.' A CDC spokesman confirmed that \\"a forced quarantine is one of the options being addressed.\\" These additional safeguards aim to ensure that Ebola will not spread in America and that health workers have time to develop symptoms and get treatment if they have contracted the virus. The decision to re-evaluate the policy follows the first Ebola death in America and has sparked differing views from the public. There are some who support this policy, while others believe it undermines the human rights of health workers who risk their lives to combat the virus abroad. This move is a clear indication of the U.S., government's seriousness to fight Ebola across borders. Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days, which means that carriers can interact with others without showing symptoms. The fact that health workers run the risk of contracting Ebola while treating patients in Africa highlights the need for global cooperation in combating the Ebola scourge. It is hoped that this aggressive quarantine policy should help contain the virus, reduce the spread, and bring the epidemic to an end soon."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily.

Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic or persistent, and pain that resolves quickly is called acute. Traditionally, the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain, though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.:93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months' duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months. A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no arbitrarily fixed durations, is pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing. Chronic pain may be classified as cancer pain or else as benign.","output":"The title of the article is \\"Understanding Chronic Pain\\"."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Speak to your doctor Make a plan to stop taking the sleeping medication.

The medication can be habit-forming and have negative side effects. By developing a plan with your doctor, you can gradually wean yourself off the medication and allow your body to adjust to sleeping naturally. One key to successfully stopping the medication is to believe in your own ability to sleep without it. Trust that your body knows what it needs and can regulate its own sleep patterns. It may take time, but with patience and persistence, you will be able to sleep naturally. It is also important to accept your own sleep needs. Everyone’s body is different and requires different amounts of sleep. By understanding and accepting your own sleep requirements, you can work towards developing a healthy sleep routine that works for you. Knowing what to expect during the process of stopping your medication is also important. You may experience some initial difficulty sleeping or some withdrawal symptoms. Be prepared for this and know that it is a natural part of the process. Overall, with the guidance of your doctor, belief in yourself, acceptance of your sleep needs, and realistic expectations, you can successfully stop taking sleeping medication and achieve natural, restful sleep."},{"instruction":"Theophilus Jones was the oldest son of Jones ( 1729 1811 ) .

Fortunately, there are several relaxation techniques you can incorporate into your daily routine to improve your sleep quality. First, try lying down and doing a deep breathing exercise. This can be as simple as taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth for a few minutes. Focusing on your breath can help calm your mind and reduce stress levels. Another effective relaxation technique is meditation. By practicing mindfulness, you can train your mind to stay present in the current moment, rather than dwelling on past or future worries. Even just a few minutes of meditation before bed can improve your chances of falling asleep and staying asleep throughout the night. If you find yourself unable to relax, consider trying progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups throughout your body, which can help release physical tension and promote relaxation. Guided imagery videos can also be a useful tool for easing into sleep. These videos provide visual and auditory cues that can help you relax and quiet your mind. There are many free options available on YouTube, so find one that resonates with you and use it regularly to wind down before bed. Finally, it is important to incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Exercise can help reduce stress levels and improve overall health, both of which can contribute to better sleep. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day, but avoid exercise too close to bedtime as it can have the opposite effect. Incorporating these relaxation techniques into your daily routine can help reduce stress and promote restful sleep. By prioritizing your sleep health, you can improve your overall well-being and enjoy a higher quality of life."},{"instruction":"This is the content of an email: Sarah, As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by email.

In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface.
