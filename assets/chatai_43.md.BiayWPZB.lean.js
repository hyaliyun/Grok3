When her friends and mother came to visit Hannah in hospital, she didn’t understand what had happened, or where she’d been. The first thing she asked her mother was, “why am I wet?”, and she didn’t appear to realize that almost three weeks had passed. She was interviewed by police, who failed to extract any information. The last thing Hannah remembered was running near her apartment on the day she went missing. In a media interview, after this first disappearance, she claimed After extensive tests, Hannah was diagnosed with a condition known as dissociative fugue, a terrifying disorder in which sufferers temporarily forget who they are. During moments of disassociation, sufferers forget all of their memories and personal information. Usually, these moments of disassociation are caused by some form of trauma, physical assault, sexual assault, natural disasters, profound sadness or PTSD. But Hannah couldn't think of any trauma she’d suffered, either recently or historically. Nor her family or friends. When people enter these fugue states, they’re usually completely functional, so they can talk, communicate, work and do whatever else they might want to do. But they can’t remember who they are, they develop a strange desire to wander, and they often make unusual and questionable decisions. Hannah felt psychologically altered by the whole process, telling an interviewer, “How do you feel guilty for something you didn’t even know you did? It’s not your fault, but it’s still somehow you. So it’s definitely made me reconsider everything. Who was I before? Who was I then? Is that part of me? Who am I now?” The Second Disappearance In September 2013, a few years after her first disappearance, Hannah Upp was living in Maryland, around 200 miles from her previous home in New York. Again, she was just in the process of starting a new teaching job. But things went awry once more, as police called Hannah’s mother with news that her daughter’s purse and cell phone had been found on a wooded trail. She hadn’t slept in her own apartment the night before. This time, it only took two days to find her. But on this occasion, Hannah found herself, seemingly able to break out independently from her fugue state. Hannah’s mother received a call from an unknown number. She picked up the phone, and the person on the other end of the line muttered “Mom?”. Hannah had been walking for more than two days before she realized who she was after jolting to consciousness while sitting in a dirty creek. Again, she had no memory of where she’d been, or how she’d made her way to the murky waters of a residential creek. Despite now having disappeared twice, Hannah was determined to keep living her life as normal. Police offered to fit her with an ankle bracelet, but she refused. But that was a decision which led to a much longer, much stranger, and much more worrying disappearance. This third and final disappearance occurred seven years after the first And it’s a mystery that still hasn’t been solved. The Third Disappearance In September 2017, Hannah Upp was 32 years old, and she’d started another new teaching job. This time, she was working on St. Thomas, a Carribean island east of Cuba, where she’d been living for around three years.","output":"ولكن ما جاء بعده جعل الأمور أكثر ارتباكًا وغرابة. عندما جاء أصدقاؤها ووالدتها لزيارة هانا في المستشفى، لم تفهم ما حدث، أو أين كانت. أول شيء سألت والدتها عنه هو \\"لماذا أنا مبللة؟\\" ولم تبدو واعية بأنها مضت تقريبًا ثلاثة أسابيع. تم استجوابها من قبل الشرطة التي لم تستطع استخلاص أي معلومات. آخر شيء تذكرته هانا كان الجري بالقرب من شقتها في يوم اختفائها. في مقابلة إعلامية بعد هذا الاختفاء الأول، ادعت أنها جرى تشخيصها بحالة تعرف بالهروب التفكيري، وهي حالة مرعبة ينسى فيها المصابون هويتهم مؤقتًا. خلال لحظات التفكك، ينسى المصابون كل ذكرياتهم ومعلوماتهم الشخصية. عادةً، تحدث هذه اللحظات من التفكك نتيجة لصدمة ما، الاعتداء الجسدي، الاعتداء الجنسي، الكوارث الطبيعية، الحزن العميق أو اضطراب ما بعد الصدمة. لكن هانا لم تستطع أن تفكر في أي اعتداء تعرضت له، سواءً مؤخرًا أو تاريخيًا. ولا عائلتها ولا أصدقائها. عندما يدخل الأشخاص في هذه الحالات من التفكك، فإنهم عادةً يكونون قادرين على القيام بكل شيء بشكل طبيعي، لذا يمكنهم التحدث والتواصل والعمل وفعل أي شيء آخر يرغبون فيه. ولكنهم لا يستطيعون تذكر هويتهم، بل يتطور لديهم رغبة غريبة في التجول، وغالبًا ما يتخذون قرارات غير عادية ومثيرة للشك. شعرت هانا بتأثر نفسي بالعملية بأكملها، وقالت في مقابلة مع محاور، \\"كيف يمكن أن تشعر بالذنب بسبب شيء لم تكن تعلم حتى أنك فعلته؟ ليس من ذنبك، لكنه لا يزال في واحدة من طرق ما. لذلك بالتأكيد دفعني لإعادة النظر في كل شيء. من كنت قبل؟ من كنت بعد ذلك؟ هل يشكل ذلك جزءًا مني؟ من أنا الآن؟\\" الاختفاء الثاني في سبتمبر 2013، بعد بضع سنوات من اختفائها الأول، كانت هانا أوب تعيش في ولاية ماريلاند، على بعد حوالي 200 ميل من منزلها السابق في نيويورك. مرة أخرى، كانت في عملية بدء عمل تدريس جديدة. ولكن الأمور تعكرت مرة أخرى، حيث اتصلت الشرطة بوالدة هانا لإبلاغها أن محفظة ابنتها وهاتفها الخلوي قد تم العثور عليهما على درب في الغابة. لم تنم في شقتها الليلة السابقة. استغرق الأمر هذه المرة يومين فقط للعثور عليها. ولكن في هذه المناسبة، وجدت هانا نفسها، قادرة تمامًا على الخروج من حالة التفكك بشكل مستقل. والدة هانا تلقت مكالمة من رقم مجهول. رفعت الهاتف، وكان الشخص على الطرف الآخر يتلعثم \\"أمي؟\\". كانت هانا تمشي لأكثر من يومين قبل أن تدرك من هي بعد أن استعادت الوعي أثناء جلوسها في نهر متسخ. مرة أخرى، لم تكن لديها أي ذاكرة لمكان وجودها أو كيفية وصولها إلى مياه مظلمة لنهر سكني. على الرغم من أنها اختفت مرتين، إلا أن هانا كانت مصممة على مواصلة حياتها بشكل طبيعي. قدمت الشرطة لها عرضًا لتركب سوارًا طراز الكاحل، ولكنها رفضت. لكن هذا كان قرارًا أدى إلى اختفاء أطول وأكثر غرابة وأكثر قلقًا. حدث هذا الاختفاء الثالث والأخير بعد سبع سنوات من الاختفاء الأول، وهو لغز لا يزال غير محلول. الاختفاء الثالث في سبتمبر 2017، كانت هانا أوب تبلغ من العمر 32 عامًا، وقد بدأت وظيفة تدريس جديدة أخرى. في هذه المرة، كانت تعمل في سانت توماس، جزيرة في منطقة البحر الكاريبي شرق كوبا، حيث كانت تعيش منذ حوالي ثلاث سنوات."},{"instruction":"你好啊","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮你的吗？"},{"instruction":"ترجم النص التالي إلى العربية باحتراف A week after she’d started teaching again, Hurricane Irma damaged Hannah’s new home, in its intense assaults on the island. 185 mile per hour winds battered St. Thomas, its homes and the people upon it, completely devastating large parts of the island. News broke that a second hurricane was on the way, so many people decided to flee the island in fear. But Hannah chose to remain, claming “I’m staying—that’s where my heart is”. On September 14th, a few days after Hurricane Irma, and only a short while before the next hurricane was expected to hit, Hannah left her home at around 8am. And that’s the last time anyone saw her. Desperate to find Hannah, friends rushed to her favorite beach, where she often snorkelled and swam. On the stool of a hamburger bar, they found her sandals, dress and car keys, which workers had previously spotted in the sand. Her car was in the parking lot, and contained her passport, cell phone and wallet. In a frantic hunt, friends, police and other investigators checked shores, seas, marinas, hospitals, homeless shelters and the airport, but they could find no trace of Hannah, and no-one claimed to have seen her. They checked all of the unidentified bodies at the local morgue, but none of them were Hannah. Hannah’s mother visited the island, keen to undertake investigations of her own. She visited various beaches and hangout spots in addition to shelters and abandoned buildings filled with addicts and outcasts. Again, she didn’t find Hannah—or anyone with any memory of seeing her. Theories Some people think Hannah might be living in the untouched regions of St. Thomas. Others speculate that she might have taken a boat to another nearby island, or that she sailed to Miami. A small few believe she might still be wandering the island in a fugue state. It’s a small place, but it has a population of around 50,000, and lots of wild, rarely visited areas. Despite its small size, it could still be an easy place to get lost. Many, who know that Hannah considered her life to be nothing but a constant journey, think she’s decided to travel onwards, whether consciously or not, to some place else, with new excitement and new adventures. Others, sadly, think she might have simply committed suicide, whether in a fugue state or not. There’s still a Facebook group dedicated to trying to find her, but most people now talk about Hannah in the past tense, certain they’ll never see her again. It seems that the vast majority of people have accepted that Hannah is now either dead or forever lost. But her background might offer some clues to her possible whereabouts—and why she was susceptible to fugue states. Let's dig a little deeper. In many ways, Hannah was raised to be a wanderer. Her father is a preacher who often visits faraway places in order to spread his word. And most summers, when her whereabouts were still known, Hannah would go with him, venturing to places in Africa and Asia in order to preach and teach. Raised in Oregon by two Methodist ministers, Hannah was religious from birth, and some","output":"أسبوع بعد أن بدأت تدريسها مرة أخرى ، ألحق إعصار إرما أضرارًا بمنزل هانا الجديد ، في هجماته المكثفة على الجزيرة. رياح بسرعة 185 ميل في الساعة هاجمت سانت توماس ومنازلها وأهلها ، دامين أجزاء كبيرة من الجزيرة تدميرًا تامًا. انتشرت الأخبار بأن إعصارًا ثانيًا قادمًا ، لذا قرر الكثيرون الفرار من الجزيرة خشيةً. لكن هانا قررت البقاء ، مؤكدةً \\"أنا سأبقى - هناك حيث قلبي\\". في 14 سبتمبر ، بضعة أيام بعد إعصار إرما ، وقبل وقت قصير من المتوقع أن يضرب الإعصار التالي ، غادرت هانا منزلها في حوالي الساعة 8 صباحًا. وهذا هو آخر مرة يرى فيها أي شخص إياها. على أمل العثور على هانا بياغتها الأصدقاء إلى الشاطئ المفضل لديها ، حيث كانت غالبًا ما تصطاد الغواصة وتسبح. في مقعد مقهى للهمبرغر ، وجدوا صنادلها وفستانها ومفاتيح سيارتها ، التي لاحظها العمال مسبقًا في الرمال. كانت سيارتها في موقف السيارات ، وتحتوي على جواز سفرها وهاتفها الخلوي ومحفظتها. في انتقال هائج ، فحص الأصدقاء والشرطة والمحققون الآخرون الشاطئ والبحر والمرافئ والمستشفيات ودور رعاية المشردين والمطار ، لكنهم لم يجدوا أي أثر لـ هانا ، ولم يدعي أحد رؤيتها. فحصوا جميع الجثث غير المتعرف عليها في محجوز المشرحة المحلية ، لكن لم يكن أيًا منها هانا. زارت والدة هانا الجزيرة ، حرصًا على إجراء تحقيقات خاصة بها. زارت شواطئ مختلفة وأماكن التسكع بالإضافة إلى ملاجئ ومبانٍ مهجورة مليئة بالمدمنين والمنبوذين. مرة أخرى ، لم تجد هانا - أو أي شخص لديه أي ذاكرة لرؤيتها. نظريات يعتقد بعض الناس أن هانا قد تعيش في المناطق الغير الملامسة في سانت توماس. يثير البعض الآخر التكهنات بأنها قد أخذت قاربًا إلى جزيرة أخرى قريبة ، أو أنها ابحرت إلى ميامي. يعتقد قلة قليلة أنها قد لا تزال تجوب الجزيرة في دوامة. إنه مكان صغير ، لكنه يضم سكانًا يبلغ عددهم حوالي 50،000 نسمة ، والكثير من المناطق البرية التي نادرًا ما يتم زيارتها. على الرغم من صغر حجمها ، قد يكون مكانًا سهلاً للضياع. يعتقد العديد ممن يعرفون أن هانا تعتبر حياتها شيئًا مستمرًا من الرحلة ، أنها قد قررت السفر إلى مكان آخر ، سواء بوعي أم لا ، بإثارة جديدة ومغامرات جديدة. يعتقد البعض الآخر بأسف أنها قد انتحرت ببساطة ، سواء بدوامة أم لا. لا يزال هناك مجموعة على Facebook مكرسة لمحاولة العثور عليها ، لكن معظم الناس يتحدثون الآن عن هانا بتوتر ، على يقين من عدم رؤيتها مرة أخرى. يبدو أن الأغلبية العظمى من الناس قد قبلت أن هانا الآن إما ميتة أو مفقودة إلى الأبد. ولكن تاريخها قد يقدم بعض الدلائل على مكان تواجدها المحتمل والسبب في أنها كانت عرضة لدوامات الذهول. دعنا نحفر قليلاً في الأمر. بعدة طرق ، تم تربيت هانا لتكون رحالة. والدها هو واعظ يزور في العادة أماكن بعيدة لنشر كلمته. وفي الغالب ، في الصيف ، عندما لا يزال يُعرف مكانها ، كانت هانا تذهب معه ، مغامرة إلى أماكن في أفريقيا وآسيا لنشر الدعوة والتعليم. نشأت هانا في أوريغون على يد واعظين من الميثوديين ، وكانت متدينة منذ ولادتها ، وبعض"},{"instruction":"que es metodologia","output":"La metodología es el conjunto de métodos, técnicas, procedimientos y pautas que se utilizan para llevar a cabo una investigación o un estudio en cualquier campo del conocimiento.

She saw contradictions within herself; her strict religious father claimed “there is no such human as a natural homosexual”, and yet Hannah herself had relationships with women. This type of religious struggle and lack of identity, along with her father’s frequent travels and relocations, might have had some type of dissociative effect on Hannah and her mind. But even more telling is a story from her mother’s past. Hannah’s mother claims that she herself once entered what might have been a fugue state, in which she went into a trance, before snapping back to reality when she found herself close to Oregon’s Willamette River. Is it possible that fugue states are an inherited condition? Researchers don’t yet know if this is the case. There are lots of other things we don’t know about fugue states—and delving into how they affect different people just makes things even more confusing. Many people suffer—and have suffered—from the alarming mystery of dissociative fugues. And here are just a few strange examples... In 1926, novelist Agatha Christie disappeared for 11 days before her husband found her 200 miles from her abandoned car. She didn’t recognize her husband, and she had no idea who she was. In February 2013, unconscious Michael Boatwright was found in a California motel room. He didn’t remember his own identity, he didn’t know how he’d arrived in the motel room, and he insisted upon referring to himself as “Johan Ek”. Strangely, he was able to communicate only in Swedish, despite being a US native and resident. One fugue-suffering professor went missing before being found three years later working as a dishwasher. In another case, a preacher left his home, traveled over 200 miles and opened a candy store. In some of these cases, this isn’t just basic catatonia—it’s fully-functioning humans accidentally adopting new names, new lives and new habits. In order to explain this seeming contradiction, some psychologists who specialize in fugue states point to the fact that we have two different types of memory—episodic memory, in which we remember certain events and memories, and procedural memory, in which we remember how to do things such as eating, typing, opening doors and walking. There’s no evidence that Hannah has ever adopted new personalities in her fugue states, but she might have done so without remembering. So Hannah could perhaps still be anywhere on the planet, doing any number of things under any number of assumed names. And that leaves us with a whole host of unanswered questions. The biggest question that Hannah has left us with is of course the puzzling riddle of—where is she? Also, why are Hannah and her things always found in or near water? The first was by Robin’s Reef. The second was by the dirty creek. Although Hannah hasn’t been found since her third disappearance, it was during a hurricane. Also, why did each disappearance occur just when she was beginning—or about to begin—a new period of work? According to some sources, before each occasion in which Hannah entered a fugue state, she always seemed a little distant and withdrawn, and not quite as open and communicative as her normal self. Is this of any significance? Could she have been much more stressed than she was allowing people to know? Or is it perhaps possible that Hannah faked her fugue states? How could she log in to her Gmail account if she couldn’t remember who she was? How was she able to enter sports clubs, which would have required her to confirm her identity upon entry? Some people believe that this is all one big hoax but I think that's unlikely. Some scientists believe that up to 0.2% of the general population might be predisposed to these states. So for every 500 people that watch this video, one of you will likely one day experience a fugue state of your own. Etzel Cardeña, a professor of psychology, claims, “In our culture, we have a nice narrative that personality is stable. That is a fiction. When a person enters a fugue and becomes someone else—or isn’t there—it’s an exaggerated version of the way we all are” Creepy? We know. So, please, take care of yourself and each other. Perhaps one day this mystery will be put to rest. We’ll just have to wait and see. Thank you for watching, see you next time.","output":"يدعي البعض أن هذه المعتقدات تسببت في صراع داخلي لهانا. رأت تناقضات داخل ذاتها؛ حيث ادعى والدها الديني الصارم \\"أنه لا يوجد شخص مثلي الجنس طبيعي\\"، ومع ذلك كانت هانا نفسها تتعامل مع النساء. هذا النوع من الصراع الديني وعدم الهوية، جنبًا إلى جنب مع سفر وانتقالات والدها المتكررة، قد يكون له تأثير تفصيلي على هانا وعقلها. ولكن ما هو أكثر إلهامًا هو قصة من ماضي والدتها. تدعي والدة هانا أنها دخلت في وقت ما في حالة تشرد، حيث دخلت في غيبوبة ثم عادت إلى الواقع عندما وجدت نفسها قرب نهر ويلاميت في ولاية أوريغون. هل من الممكن أن حالات التشرد هي حالة موروثة؟ الباحثون لا يعرفون حتى الآن ما إذا كانت هذه هي الحالة. هناك أشياء كثيرة لا نعرفها عن حالات التشرد، واستكشاف كيف تؤثر على الأشخاص المختلفين يجعل الأمور أكثر ارتباكًا. كثير من الناس يعانون - ولديهم تاريخ من - الغموض المخيف للتشرد التفكيري. وفيما يلي بعض الأمثلة الغريبة... في عام 1926، اختفت الكاتبة الروائية أجاثا كريستي لمدة 11 يومًا قبل أن يجدها زوجها على بعد 200 ميلاً من سيارتها المهجورة. لم تعرف زوجها، ولم تكن تعرف من هي. في فبراير 2013، عُثر على مايكل بوترايت الفاقد الوعي في غرفة فندق في كاليفورنيا. لم يتذكر هويته الخاصة، ولم يعرف كيف وصل إلى الغرفة، وأصر على أن يشير إليه بأنه \\"جوهان إيك\\". بشكل غريب، كان قادرًا على التواصل فقط باللغة السويدية، على الرغم من أنه مواطن ومقيم أمريكي. ذهب أستاذ مصاب بالحالة التشرد في حالة فقدان قبل أن يتم العثور عليه بعد ثلاث سنوات وهو يعمل كغسال صحون. في حالة أخرى، غادر أحد القساوسة منزله، وسافر لمسافة تزيد على 200 ميلاً وفتح محل حلوى. في بعض هذه الحالات، ليست مجرد حالة قطونة بل هي بشر بوظائفهم الكاملة عن طريق الخطأ باعتبارهم أسماء وحياة وعادات جديدة. لشرح هذا التناقض الظاهر، يشير بعض النفسانيين المتخصصين في حالات التشرد التفكيري إلى حقيقة وجود نوعين مختلفين من الذاكرة - الذاكرة الحدثية، حيث نتذكر بعض الأحداث والذكريات، والذاكرة الإجرائية، حيث نتذكر كيفية فعل الأشياء مثل الأكل والكتابة وفتح الأبواب والمشي. لا يوجد أدلة تشير إلى أن هانا قد اعتمدت شخصيات جديدة في حالات التشرد التفكيري الخاصة بها، ولكنها ربما قد فعلت ذلك دون تذكر. لذلك، ربما لا تزال هانا في أي مكان على هذا الكوكب، تفعل أي عدد من الأشياء تحت أي عدد من الأسماء المفترضة. وهذا يترك لدينا العديد من الأسئلة دون إجابة. أكبر سؤال تركته هانا لنا هو بالطبع اللغز المحير - أين هي؟ وأيضًا، لماذا يتم العثور على هانا وأشياؤها دائمًا في الماء أو بالقرب منه؟ المرة الأولى كانت بجانب روبن ريف، والثانية بجانب الجدعان القذر. على الرغم من أنه لم يتم العثور على هانا منذ اختفائها الثالث، وقع ذلك أثناء إعصار. أيضًا، لماذا حدث كل اختفاء فقط عندما كانت تبدأ - أو على وشك أن تبدأ - فترة عمل جديدة؟ وفقًا لبعض المصادر، قبل كل حالة تشرد دخلت هانا فيها، بدت دائمًا غائبة ومنعزلة قليلاً، وليس لديها نفس الانفتاح والتواصل الذي يعد طبيعيًا لها. هل هذا له أي دلالة؟ هل يمكن أن تكون أكثر توترًا مما سمحت للناس بمعرفته؟ أم أنه من الممكن ربما أن هانا مزيفة لحالاتها التشرد التفكيري؟ كيف يمكن أن تسجل دخولها إلى حسابها في Gmail إذا كانت لا تتذكر من هي؟ كيف كانت قادرة على الانضمام إلى النوادي الرياضية التي ستتطلب منها تأكيد هويتها عند الدخول؟ بعض الناس يعتقدون أن كل هذا عبارة عن خدعة ولكن أعتقد أن ذلك غير محتمل. بعض العلماء يعتقدون أن ما يصل إلى 0.2٪ من السكان العام قد يكونون عرضة لهذه الحالات. لذلك، لكل 500 شخص يشاهد هذا الفيديو، فإن واحداً منكم ربما سيتجرب في يوم من الأيام حالة تشرد تفكيرية خاصة به. يدعي إتزيل كاردينا، أستاذ علم النفس: \\"في ثقافتنا، لدينا رواية جميلة تفيد بأن الشخصية ثابتة. هذا هو خدعة. عندما يدخل الشخص حالة تشرد ويصبح شخصًا آخر - أو أنه غير موجود - فهذا هو إصدار مبالغ فيه للطريقة التي جميعنا بها\\" مخيف؟ نحن نعلم. لذا من فضلك، اعتني بنفسك وببعضنا البعض. ربما في يوم من الأيام سيتم حل هذا اللغز. سنضطر إلى الانتظار ونرى. شكرًا لمشاهدتكم، نراكم في المرة القادمة."},{"instruction":"Code source pour se connecter à une base de données créé MySQL xampp","output":"Voici un exemple de code source en PHP pour se connecter à une base de données MySQL créée avec XAMPP : \`\`\`php <?php servername = \\"localhost\\"; username = \\"root\\"; password = \\"\\"; // Crée une connexion à la base de données conn = new mysqli(servername, username, password); // Vérifie la connexion if (conn->connect_error) { die(\\"La connexion a échoué : \\" . conn->connect_error); } echo \\"Connexion réussie !\\"; // Ferme la connexion conn->close(); ?> \`\`\` Assurez-vous de remplacer \\"root\\" par votre nom d'utilisateur MySQL et \\"\\" par votre mot de passe si vous en avez créé un.

Сложность настройки: Celery может быть сложным для настройки и использования, особенно для новичков. Настройка рабочих узлов, брокеров сообщений и баз данных может потребовать дополнительного времени и усилий. 2. Сложность отладки: При возникновении проблем с выполнением задач может быть сложно отследить ошибки и найти точные места, где они происходят. Библиотека предоставляет ограниченные инструменты для отладки, и это может затруднить процесс разработки и тестирования. 3. Возможные проблемы с производительностью: Celery может иметь проблемы с производительностью при обработке больших объемов задач. Если система не настроена должным образом или если требуется обработка большого количества данных, это может привести к потере производительности или неполной обработке задач. 4. Большое потребление ресурсов: Celery требует наличия отдельных рабочих узлов для выполнения задач, и каждый узел занимает дополнительные ресурсы, такие как оперативная память и процессорное время. Это может вызывать проблемы с масштабируемостью и требовать больше ресурсов для поддержки системы. 5. Отсутствие встроенной поддержки отказоустойчивости: В случае сбоя рабочего узла или брокера сообщений может потребоваться дополнительная настройка или использование сторонних инструментов для обеспечения отказоустойчивости. Celery не предоставляет встроенных механизмов для автоматической обработки таких ситуаций."},{"instruction":"что лучше чем celery","output":"Существует несколько альтернативных инструментов, которые могут быть лучше в некоторых сценариях, чем библиотека Celery: 1. asyncio: asyncio является стандартной библиотекой Python для асинхронного программирования. Она предоставляет более простой и низкоуровневый способ асинхронной обработки, чем Celery. Она также интегрируется со многими другими инструментами и фреймворками Python. 2. rq (Redis Queue): rq - это простая, но мощная библиотека для асинхронной обработки задач на основе брокера очереди Redis. RQ имеет более простую настройку и использование, чем Celery, и может быть предпочтительным выбором для малых и средних проектов. 3. Dramatiq: Dramatiq - это декларативный фреймворк для асинхронной обработки задач в Python. Он имеет простой интерфейс и хорошую производительность. Dramatiq может быть лучшим выбором для проектов, которым требуется простота использования и гибкость. 4. Python multiprocessing: Если вам не нужны распределенные возможности и вам нужен только параллельный запуск задач на одной машине, стандартная библиотека Python multiprocessing может быть лучшим выбором. Она предоставляет простой способ запуска параллельных процессов и обмен данных между ними. Однако выбор конкретного инструмента зависит от ваших конкретных требований и предпочтений, поэтому рекомендуется провести дальнейшее исследование и сравнение разных инструментов, прежде чем принять окончательное решение."},{"instruction":"veuillez reformuler le message ci-aprés Nous vous informons que le contrat en cours sous le n° expire fin décembre de l'année en cours Pendant cette période restante, nous espérons lancer les démarches administratives pour une nouvelle activation qui entrera en vigueur à partir de janvier 2024.

Politický režim: Nacistická strana by se stala jedinou vládnoucí stranou a prosazovala by nacistickou ideologii, která zahrnovala rasovou supremacii, nacionalismus a antisemitismus. Zrušení politických stran a omezené svobody projevu by byly běžným jevem. 2. Násilné potlačování protinacistického odporu: Proti režimu by pravděpodobně vyvstala silná odporová hnutí a partyzánské skupiny. Ty by byly brutálně potlačovány Německou armádou a gestapem, což by vedlo k masovým popravám, zatýkání a mučení. 3. Změny ve společnosti: Nacistický režim by se snažil o změnu morálních a kulturních hodnot obyvatelstva, například prostřednictvím propaganda a kontroly médií. Proměnila by se školství, literatura a umělecké směry, aby sloužily nacistické propagandě. 4. Diskriminace a perzekuce: Zvláště ovlivněni by byli židé, Romové, homosexuálové a političtí odpůrci. Židovské obyvatelstvo by bylo zbaveno všech práv, vyháněno ze svých domovů a deportováno do koncentračních táborů. Romové by byli postiženi zásadní diskriminací a perzekucí. 5. Průmyslová restrukturalizace: Hospodářství by bylo organizováno podle nacistického modelu, což by znamenalo centralizaci a změny ve vlastnictví podniků. Německé firmy by získaly výrazný vliv a mnoho průmyslových odvětví by sloužilo německým potřebám. 6. Zánik demokracie a občanských práv: Lidé by přišli o svobodu projevu, tisku, sdružování a shromažďování. Státní represe by se stala běžnou součástí každodenního života, a to včetně sledování, vyslýchání a cenzury. 7. Vojsko a okupace: Německá armáda a gestapo by kontrolovaly území České republiky a měly vliv na každodenní život obyvatelstva. Vojenští velitelé by určovali směr politiky a prosazovali válečné cíle nacistického režimu. Je důležité si uvědomit, že tato představa je pouze hypotetická a založená na historických znalostech. Skutečnost by mohla vykazovat různé odchylky a případné specifické události, které by ovlivnily podobu života na území České republiky pod vedením nacistického režimu."},{"instruction":"A jak by to vypadalo v roce 2023?","output":"Hypoteticky předpokládáme, že by Hitler vyhrál druhou světovou válku a nacistické Německo ovládlo území České republiky. Pokud by takový scénář pokračoval až do roku 2023, mohlo by to mít následující dopady: 1. Politický režim: Nacistická strana by stále kontrolovala politickou moc a udržovala by represivní režim. Represe a omezení svobody projevu by byly běžné a političtí odpůrci by byli potlačováni. 2. Válka a konflikty: Existuje pravděpodobnost, že by nacistické Německo stále bylo zapojeno v ozbrojených konfliktech, čímž by se podporovala jeho expanze a dominance. To by mohlo vést ke konfliktům na území České republiky a možným invazím jiných zemí. 3. Ekonomika: Hospodářství by bylo organizováno na základě nacistického modelu, což znamená centralizaci a kontrolu státem. Průmyslový sektor by byl podřízen potřebám vojenství a ekonomická prosperita obyvatelstva by byla omezená. 4. Sociální změny: Rasová supremacie, antisemitismus a další formy diskriminace by se staly součástí společenského řádu. Příslušníci nerománského etnika a menšin by stále čelili pronásledování a diskriminaci. 5. Technologický vývoj: Nacistické Německo investovalo do pokročilých technologií, zejména v oblasti válečného výzkumu. Pokud by měli nadále přístup ke zdrojům a vědeckým mozkům, jejich technologický pokrok by mohl být výrazný, zejména v oblasti zbraní a vojenské techniky. Opět je důležité si uvědomit, že se jedná pouze o hypotetický scénář. Skutečnost by se pravděpodobně významně lišila a závisela na mnoha faktorech. Druhá světová válka měla významný vliv na povědomí a vyvození poučení o válečných zločinech a lidských právech, takže by bylo nepravděpodobné, že by se situace v roce 2023 zcela shodovala s tímto pozadím."},{"instruction":"Kdy by se pravdepodobne odehrala treti svetova valka?","output":"Je důležité si uvědomit, že jako AI model nemohu předvídat nebo spekulovat o budoucích událostech. Přesný čas nebo datum, kdy by se případná třetí světová válka mohla odehrát, je založen na mnoha nepředvídatelných socio-politických a ekonomických faktorech, které jsou těžko předvídatelné. Třetí světová válka by byla globálním konfliktem mezi různými mocnostmi. Je důležité si uvědomit, že vývoj politických, ekonomických a geopolitických situací je neustále proměnlivý a závisí na mnoha proměnných. Mezinárodní vztahy, diplomatické jednání a snahy o udržení míru jsou klíčovými faktory, které významně ovlivňují pravděpodobnost vypuknutí válečného konfliktu. Mezinárodní společenství vytváří instituce jako OSN, které se snaží udržovat mír a vyjednávat řešení sporů diplomatickou cestou. Avšak předpovídání, zda budou tato opatření dostatečná na zabránění třetí světové války, je mimo moje schopnosti. Je proto velmi důležité, aby diplomatická jednání a mírová opatření byla stále prioritou, a aby se mezinárodní společenství snažilo vybudovat a udržovat vzájemnou spolupráci, dialog a mírové řešení sporů. Tímto se vytváří prostředí, které snižuje riziko konfliktu a posiluje stabilitu na globální úrovni."},{"instruction":"Ta otazka byla myslena jinak. Jak dlouho by vydrzelo stabilni svetove usporadani, pokud by nacisticke Nemecko vyhrálo druhou světovou válku?","output":"Pokud by nacistické Německo vyhrálo druhou světovou válku a dosáhlo globální dominance, je velmi obtížné předvídat, jak by se světové uspořádání vyvíjelo v dlouhodobějším horizontu. Nicméně je možné uvažovat o několika scénářích: 1. Dlouhodobá nacistická dominance: Pokud by nacistické Německo dokázalo udržet svou moc nad dobytými územími a ovládat světové regiony, mohla by se jejich ideologie a praktiky stát globálně přijímanými. To by pravděpodobně vedlo ke značnému potlačení občanských svobod, rasové diskriminaci a vytvoření silného centrálního režimu. 2. Oporování protinacistického odporu: Jako reakce na nacistickou dominanci by vznikla mnohá odbojová hnutí a protinacistické organizace. Ty by se snažily bojovat proti režimu a obnovit svobodu a demokracii. 3. Mezinárodní odpor a spolupráce: Země, které by odmítly přijmout nacistickou ideologii, by se mohly spolupracovat v boji proti nacistům. Vytvoření aliancí a mezinárodního odporu by mohlo vést k pokusu osvobodit okupovaná území a přerušit plány nacistického rozšíření. 4. Vnitřní rozpory a potenciální pád režimu: Nacistická vláda mohla čelit vnitřním rozporům a nepokojům, zejména pokud by se jejich politika projevila jako ekonomicky neudržitelná nebo odporující základním potřebám obyvatelstva. To by mohlo oslabit nacistický režim a vyústit ve vnitřní křehkost nebo pád. Je důležité si uvědomit, že tato představa je pouze spekulativní a nemůžeme s jistotou vědět, jak by se světové uspořádání vyvíjelo po takovém vítězství Nacistického Německa. Důsledky by závisely na řadě faktorů, jako je vývoj technologií, mezinárodní reakce, vnitrostátní politika a další proměnné."},{"instruction":"When did paper, an invention from Han Dynasty China, make its way into Europe?","output":"Paper, invented in Han Dynasty China around the 2nd century BCE, gradually made its way into Europe centuries later. The exact timeline of when paper reached Europe is not entirely clear, but it is believed to have arrived in limited quantities during the Islamic Golden Age. The first reference to paper in Europe dates back to the 10th century CE, when it was mentioned in a document from Muslim-ruled Sicily. However, it took more time for paper to become widely used and establish itself as a common writing material in Europe. By the 12th century, paper production started to develop in Italy and Spain, and it spread further across Europe in the following centuries. The printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, also played a significant role in boosting the demand for paper in Europe."},{"instruction":"In cultures where they were present, why were cowry shells considered so valuable, to the point that they acted as the precursor to money?","output":"Cowry shells were considered valuable in various cultures for several reasons, which eventually led to their use as a form of currency. Here are some factors that contributed to their value: 1. Rarity: Cowry shells were not readily available in all regions, making them relatively scarce. Their scarcity made them desirable and increased their value. 2. Durability: Cowry shells are durable and do not deteriorate easily over time. They can withstand wear and tear, making them a reliable form of currency. 3. Portability: Cowry shells are small and lightweight, making them easy to carry and transport. This portability made them convenient for use in trade and exchange. 4. Aesthetic appeal: Cowry shells often possess an attractive appearance, with their smooth, shiny surface and unique patterns. Their visual appeal added to their desirability and value. 5. Symbolic significance: In some cultures, cowry shells held symbolic meaning and were associated with wealth, prosperity, and even spiritual or religious beliefs. This symbolism further enhanced their value. 6. Cultural significance: Cowry shells were used in various cultural practices, such as adornments, rituals, and ceremonies. Their cultural significance added to their value and made them highly sought after. Due to these factors, cowry shells gradually became accepted as a medium of exchange and acted as a precursor to money in many societies.

Further investigation into the detailed reaction pathways, intermediates, and active sites is necessary to develop accurate computational models and guide experimental studies. [6] Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary efforts involving materials scientists, chemists, engineers, and computational researchers. By overcoming these hurdles, two-dimensional materials hold the potential to revolutionize carbon dioxide reduction technologies and contribute to the global transition to a more sustainable future.

The distinction between these shades of gray is meant to represent variations in the composition and texture of the lunar terrain. Dark gray areas typically indicate smoother, relatively level regions known as mare or lunar seas. These areas are composed of solidified lava flows from ancient volcanic activity on the moon. They have lower elevations and appear darker due to their composition, which reflects less light. Examples of famous mare areas on the Moon include the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) and the Sea of Serenity (Mare Serenitatis). Light gray areas, on the other hand, represent more rugged and elevated regions on the lunar surface. These areas consist of mountain ranges, highlands, and impact craters. They generally have a rougher texture and are often covered with regolith—the loose, fragmented material that covers the lunar surface. The lighter shade of gray in these areas indicates a higher reflectivity of sunlight due to the rougher texture and presence of exposed rocky surfaces. The contrasting dark and light gray regions on Luna's map provide an overview of the moon's different biomes, showcasing the varied geological features present on the lunar surface."},{"instruction":"from openpyxl import load_workbook import pandas as pd import datetime # 打开Excel文件 wb = load_workbook(filename=r'C:UsersLIQIDocuments民生基金行业打分钢铁数据跟踪汇总.xlsx', read_only=True, data_only=True) # 选择指定的sheet sheet = wb['产销数据'] # 这里的Sheet3是你要读取的sheet名称，可以根据实际情况修改 # 选择指定的列 columns = [0, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] # 读取数据 data = [] for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True): data.append([row[column] for column in columns]) # 构建DataFrame headers = ['Column1','Column2', 'Column3', 'Column4', 'Column5', 'Column6'] # 这里是DataFrame的列名，可以根据实际情况修改 df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=headers) df = df[1:] df.columns = df.iloc[0] df = df[1:] # 将第一列作为索引并转换为datetime格式 df.set_index(df.columns[0], inplace=True) df.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index) def calculate_percentile(df, date, column): date = pd.to_datetime(date) target_dates = pd.date_range(end=date, periods=5) target_values = df.loc[target_dates, column] target_value_mean = target_values.mean() five_years_ago = date - pd.DateOffset(years=3) date_range = pd.date_range(start=five_years_ago, end=date) history_values = df.loc[date_range, column] # Calculate smoothed values history_means = history_values.rolling(window=5).mean() # Filter out the same month and day values history_values = df[(df.index.month.isin(date_range.month)) & (df.index.day.isin(date_range.day))][column] target_smoothed_value = target_value_mean max_smoothed_value = history_means.max() min_smoothed_value = history_means.min() percentile = (target_smoothed_value - min_smoothed_value) / (max_smoothed_value - min_smoothed_value) * 100 return percentile # 创建一个空的列表，用于存储每一天的percentile值 percentiles = [] # 设置起始日期 start_date = pd.to_datetime('2023-01-01') # 循环遍历DataFrame的每一行 for index, row in df.iterrows(): # 检查是否满足起始日期的条件，如果不满足，则跳过计算 if index < start_date: percentiles.append(None) continue # 获取当前行的日期和列名 date = index column = '螺纹钢' # 要计算percentile的列名，请根据实际情况修改 # 调用calculate_percentile函数计算percentile值 percentile = calculate_percentile(df, date, column) # 将percentile值添加到列表中 percentiles.append(percentile) # 将percentiles列表添加为新的一列到DataFrame中 df['Percentile'] = percentiles 现在我要在df增加一列df['Percentile YOY']，对每一个date，'Percentile YOY'就是这个date上的Percentile列结果减去上年同期的Percentile列结果。这个代码怎么写。","output":"可以使用\`shift\`函数和日期偏移来计算上一年同期的日期，并在循环中进行计算。以下是修改后的代码： \`\`\`python # 创建一个空的列表，用于存储每一天的Percentile YOY值 percentile_yoy = [] # 循环遍历DataFrame的每一行 for index, row in df.iterrows(): # 检查是否满足起始日期的条件，如果不满足，则跳过计算 if index < start_date: percentile_yoy.append(None) continue # 获取当前行的日期和列名 date = index column = '螺纹钢' # 要计算Percentile YOY的列名，请根据实际情况修改 # 获取上一年同期的日期 last_year_date = date - pd.DateOffset(years=1) # 检查上一年同期的日期是否在DataFrame中存在 if last_year_date in df.index: # 计算上一年同期的Percentile值 last_year_percentile = df.loc[last_year_date, 'Percentile'] # 计算Percentile YOY值 percentile_yoy_value = row['Percentile'] - last_year_percentile percentile_yoy.append(percentile_yoy_value) else: percentile_yoy.append(None) # 将percentile_yoy列表添加为新的一列到DataFrame中 df['Percentile YOY'] = percentile_yoy \`\`\` 请根据实际情况修改\`column\`变量的值以及你想要的起始日期\`start_date\`。"},{"instruction":"headers = [‘Column1’,‘Column2’, ‘Column3’, ‘Column4’, ‘Column5’, ‘Column6’] # 这里是DataFrame的列名，可以根据实际情况修改 df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=headers) df = df[1:] df.columns = df.iloc[0] df = df[1:] 这几句代码麻烦给我注释一下","output":"Sure!

Assessing a child's ability to visualize may indeed be helpful in identifying areas where additional support or instruction might be beneficial. However, it is important to approach this topic with caution and consider various factors. Visual thinking and the ability to visualize can vary greatly among individuals. Some children may naturally possess strong visualization skills, while others may struggle in this area. It is crucial to remember that visual thinking is just one of the many ways in which children learn and process information. It should not be the sole determining factor in evaluating a child's intelligence or capabilities. Assessments for visual thinking should be designed in a developmentally appropriate way to ensure children are not overwhelmed or discouraged. It is also important to consider a holistic approach to education, considering various learning styles and incorporating different teaching strategies to accommodate all students' needs, including those who may struggle with visualization. Implementing supportive measures, such as incorporating visual aids, hands-on activities, and encouraging creative thinking, can help enhance children's visualization skills. Additionally, working closely with parents/guardians to identify and address any individual learning needs is crucial. Ultimately, the goal should be to foster a well-rounded education that addresses the diverse needs of students, rather than simply focusing on one aspect of their cognitive abilities."},{"instruction":"List 100 Fan-Made Types of Powerful God Transformations for SpongeBob.","output":"1.

However, it is important to consider a few factors before implementing such tests: 1. Comprehensive assessment: Testing a child's ability to visualize should be part of a comprehensive assessment process that also considers other aspects of the child's development, such as cognitive abilities, social-emotional skills, physical development, and language skills. A holistic evaluation would provide a more accurate understanding of the child's overall capabilities. 2. Developmental variation: Keep in mind that children develop at different rates, and their abilities, including visualization skills, will naturally vary. Some children may be more inclined towards visual learning, while others may excel in different areas. Therefore, it is crucial not to label certain abilities as superior or inferior, but rather recognize and support each child's individual strengths. 3. Teaching approaches: Instead of excluding children who may struggle with visualizing, it would be more beneficial to offer a variety of teaching approaches to cater to different learning styles. Incorporating diverse instructional methods, such as visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile-based techniques, can help create an inclusive learning environment that engages all children effectively. 4. Early intervention: Identifying potential difficulties in visualization skills early on can enable targeted interventions and appropriate support. Schools and educators can provide additional resources or interventions to help children develop their visualization abilities if they are found to be lacking. 5.

It's just... I wasn't prepared for this sudden change. Natsuki: Hey, don't worry too much. We'll help you figure it out together. Who knows, maybe it'll be a temporary thing. Sayori: Yeah! And even if it's not, we'll still be your friends regardless of your bust size! (Yuri smiles, feeling grateful for the supportive atmosphere within the club.) Yuri: Thank you, everyone. Your acceptance means a lot to me. I suppose I just need some time to adjust and embrace whatever changes come my way. Monika: That's the spirit, Yuri. Remember, beauty comes from within, and the size of your chest doesn't define who you are as a person. (The girls continue their discussion, offering advice and reassurance to Yuri. Together, they help her navigate the unexpected situation, reminding her that true friendship goes beyond physical appearances.)"},{"instruction":"La problématique sur l'étude de la conception d'une application mobile pour la gestion scolaire","output":"La problématique sur l'étude de la conception d'une application mobile pour la gestion scolaire est de déterminer comment concevoir une application mobile efficace et adaptée aux besoins spécifiques de la gestion scolaire.

SQL Injection هي ثغرة أمنية تسمح للمهاجم بتنفيذ أوامر SQL غير مصرح بها داخل التطبيقات التي تعتمد على قواعد البيانات. لفهم SQL Injection، يجب عليك أولاً فهم كيفية عمل استعلامات SQL وكيفية استرجاع البيانات من قواعد البيانات. استعلام SQL يتكون من أوامر مثل SELECT و INSERT و UPDATE و DELETE ويستخدم للتفاعل مع البيانات في قواعد البيانات. SQL Injection يتم عادة عن طريق إدخال بيانات غير صالحة أو غير متوقعة في حقول إدخال البيانات في تطبيق ويب. على سبيل المثال، إذا كان هناك حقل إدخال تسجيل الدخول يأخذ اسم المستخدم وكلمة المرور ويستخدمها في استعلام SQL للتحقق من صحة بيانات تسجيل الدخول، يمكن للمهاجم إدخال أوامر SQL إضافية في حقل اسم المستخدم أو كلمة المرور لتنفيذ أوامر SQL غير مصرح بها. لحماية التطبيقات من SQL Injection، يجب على المطورين تحقيق ثقة البيانات المدخلة من المستخدمين وتجنب استخدام البيانات المدخلة مباشرة في استعلامات SQL. يجب أيضًا استخدام تعليمات مثل بيانات محددة مسبقًا (مثل bind parameters) والتحقق من صحة البيانات المدخلة قبل استخدامها في استعلامات SQL. ومع ذلك، يتطلب فهم كامل لعمليات قواعد البيانات وإدارتها وتطوير التطبيقات لحماية التطبيقات بشكل فعال من SQL Injection."},{"instruction":"请把下面的日文翻译成中文。取り返しのつかない大事なものって壊したくなるでしょ？ そういう事です。","output":"取り返しのつかない大事なものって壊したくなるでしょ？这是这样的情况。"},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Sangonomiya Kokomi wakes up in her room.

Please answer in full sentences No bullet points.","output":"In 1988, the Swiss government experienced a significant event known as the Swissair Flight 111 crash. On September 2nd of that year, Swissair Flight 111, a commercial passenger aircraft traveling from New York to Geneva, crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The crash resulted in the tragic loss of all 229 passengers and crew members on board. The Swiss government played a crucial role in responding to the incident, coordinating search and recovery operations with Canada and providing support to the families of the victims. It was a somber time for the Swiss government as the nation mourned the loss of so many lives in this devastating air disaster."},{"instruction":"Anything else?","output":"In addition to the Swissair Flight 111 crash, 1988 was a significant year for the Swiss government in terms of international relations. Switzerland continued to maintain its traditional policy of neutrality and actively participated in diplomatic efforts for peaceful resolutions of conflicts. The government also focused on strengthening economic ties and international cooperation. In 1988, Switzerland signed various bilateral agreements including an important treaty with the European Economic Community (EEC, now known as the European Union) to improve economic relations. These agreements aimed to enhance trade, investment, and cooperation between Switzerland and its European neighbors. Furthermore, the Swiss government continued to prioritize its domestic policies, such as maintaining its reputation as a global financial hub and promoting human rights and social welfare within the country."},{"instruction":"I meant any about the government itself, not Swissair Flight 111?","output":"Apologies for the confusion. In terms of the Swiss government itself in 1988, there were no major political upheavals or changes in leadership during that year. The Swiss Federal Council, which serves as the collective head of government, continued to operate with a rotating presidency system. In 1988, the presidency of the Swiss Federal Council was held by Federal Councilor Leon Schlumpf. The Federal Council focused on various policy areas such as maintaining Switzerland's neutrality, managing the economy, ensuring social stability, and representing the country internationally. They continued to work on effective governance, addressing citizen concerns, and managing the day-to-day affairs of the Swiss government."},{"instruction":"Why is the subdivisions of Switzerland \\"Cantons\\"?","output":"The subdivisions of Switzerland are known as \\"cantons\\" because the term originates from the historical development of Swiss political organization. The term \\"canton\\" is derived from the old French word \\"canton,\\" which means corner or district. Switzerland has a unique history of decentralized governance, which dates back to the formation of the Swiss Confederation in the 13th century. The confederation began as a loose alliance of several independent regions, each with its own distinct political and administrative systems. Over time, these independent regions, known as cantons, joined together for mutual defense and cooperation, forming the foundation of modern-day Switzerland. The cantons were central to the formation of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848 when the Swiss Federal Constitution was established. The constitution granted significant autonomy to the cantons, with powers devolved to them in various areas, such as education, healthcare, taxation, and criminal justice. This system of federalism allows the cantons to have substantial authority over their own affairs while maintaining a cohesive national identity. Today, Switzerland consists of 26 cantons, each with its own government, constitution, and legislature. They retain substantial autonomy in several policy areas and play a crucial role in shaping Swiss politics, legislation, and societal development. The cantonal system reflects the historical and cultural diversity of Switzerland and remains an integral part of its political structure."},{"instruction":"Who is the leader of the Cantons?","output":"In Switzerland, each canton is led by its own executive authority, known as the cantonal government or council. The leader of the cantonal government is typically referred to as the \\"Cantonal President\\" or \\"Cantonal Governor.\\" The specific title may vary depending on the canton. The leadership structures within the cantonal governments differ from one canton to another. In some cantons, the Cantonal President is elected by the cantonal parliament or legislative body, while in others, the position may be rotational, with a different member of the cantonal government serving as president for a specific term. It's important to note that Switzerland practices a system of direct democracy, where decisions are often made through referendums or popular votes. The role of the Cantonal President is primarily focused on the internal management, coordination, and representation of the canton's government, rather than having a direct role in national-level decision-making. Due to the decentralized nature of the Swiss political system, each canton operates relatively independently and has its own unique political dynamics and leadership structures."},{"instruction":"Alexis Glass-Mason из сериала Falling Skies проникла в реальный мир в поисках слуг.

(Tighnari and Nahida start discussing possible reasons for Collei's disappearance and formulating a strategy to find her) Nahida: (thinking) Collei was last seen near the Dendro Grove yesterday, right? We should start our search there and expand our efforts outward. Tighnari: (nodding) Agreed. I'll mobilize our scouts and send them to known meeting spots and locations she often frequents. We can't leave any stone unturned. Nahida: Thank you, Tighnari. I'll personally lead a search party to the Dendro Grove. We'll comb through every inch until we find any clue leading to Collei's whereabouts. (Tighnari and Nahida gather a team of skilled individuals and set off towards the Dendro Grove, determined to bring Collei back safely) Nahida: (to the search party) Everyone, spread out and keep your eyes peeled. We must find any trace of Collei. She's counting on us.

Itt van néhány teendő: 1. Azonnal szakítsa meg a hálózati kapcsolatot: Ha van internetkapcsolat, húzza ki a hálózati kábelt vagy kapcsolja ki a Wi-Fi-t. Ez megakadályozza a vírus további terjedését a hálózaton keresztül. 2. Ismerje fel a fertőzött fájlokat: Azt javaslom, hogy hagyja a vírusvédelmi programot eltávolítani a fertőzött fájlokat. Helyezze a karanténba vagy távolítsa el őket a program utasításai szerint. 3. Futtasson teljes rendszer ellenőrzést: Indítsa el a vírusvédelmi programot, és futtasson teljes rendszerellenőrzést. Így megbizonyosodhat arról, hogy nincsenek további fertőzések a rendszerben. 4. Távolítsa el a fertőzött fájlokat: Ha a vírusprogram fertőzött fájlokat azonosított, javaslom, hogy távolítsa el őket a vírusvédelmi programmal vagy manuálisan, ha tudja, hogyan kell biztonságosan elvégezni. 5. Telepítsen megbízható vírusvédelmi szoftvert: Ha még nem tette meg, telepítsen megbízható és frissített vírusvédelmi szoftvert a gépre, és rendszeresen frissítse a vírusdefiníciókat, hogy a lehető legnagyobb védelmet biztosítsa. 6. Változtassa meg a jelszavakat: A fertőzés még mindig fennállhat a gépen, ezért fontos, hogy változtassa meg az összes fontos jelszavát, például az e-mail fiókhoz, közösségi média fiókokhoz és banki fiókokhoz tartozó jelszavakat. Ez segít megelőzni a személyes adatokhoz való illetéktelen hozzáférést. 7. Frissítse a számítógépet: Telepítse az összes elérhető rendszerfrissítést és szoftverfrissítést, mivel ezek tartalmazhatnak olyan javításokat, amelyek megelőzik a vírusok további behatolását vagy terjedését. 8. Vigyázzon a jövőbeli letöltésekre: Legyen óvatos, és csak megbízható forrásból töltsön le fájlokat. Ha valami gyanús vagy ismeretlen, ne nyissa meg vagy ne telepítse azt a gépre. 9. Tanácsok megelőzésre: Fontos a rendszeres biztonsági mentések, a gyenge jelszavak elkerülése, a böngészőbiztonsági beállítások ellenőrzése és frissítése, valamint a gyanús e-mailektől és letöltésektől való távolmaradás. Ha ezek a lépések nem vezetnek a fertőzés teljes eltávolításához, vagy további problémák merülnek fel a számítógépen, ajánlom, hogy vegye fel a kapcsolatot egy szakemberrel, aki segíthet megoldani a helyzetet."},{"instruction":"Sikerült eltávolítani szerencaére gyors voltam ilyenkir fel kell jelenteni az iskolát hogy kártevő van a hálózati meghajtójukon","output":"Nem vagyok jogi szakértő, de ha úgy érzi, hogy az iskolai hálózatban talált kártevőt jelenteni kell, megteheti az iskola informatikai osztályának vagy vezetőségének.

Kapcsolatba kell lépnie velük, és részletekkel kell ellátnia azon fájlok nevét és elérési útvonalát, amelyek fertőzöttek vagy gyanúsak lehetnek. Fontos, hogy azonnal jelentse az esetet, hogy intézkedni tudjanak a vizsga biztonságossága érdekében, és megelőzzék a további fertőzéseket vagy incidenseket az EDCL programban.

Ha otthon csak a meglévő anyagokat nézegette a számítógépén, és a Windows Defender jelzést adott, akkor jó lépést tett a vírusvédelemre. Az, hogy a Windows Defender észlelt egy fenyegetést, azt jelenti, hogy a számítógépét sikeresen megvédte a potenciális vírusoktól vagy kártevőktől. A következő teendők a következők lehetnek: 1. Engedélyezze a Windows Defender további intézkedéseit: Azonnal kövesse a Windows Defender ajánlásait és utasításait az észlelt fenyegetés kezelésére. Általában a Defender karanténba helyezi vagy eltávolítja a fenyegetést. 2. Futtasson teljes rendszerellenőrzést: Futtassa le a Windows Defenderrel a teljes rendszerellenőrzést, hogy megbizonyosodjon arról, hogy nincsenek további fenyegetések a rendszerben. 3. Frissítse a vírusdefiníciókat: Biztosítsa, hogy a Windows Defender rendelkezzen a legfrissebb vírusdefiníciókkel. Ez azt jelenti, hogy rendszeresen frissítse a Windows Defender-t, hogy a védelem mindig naprakész legyen. 4. Vigyázzon a jövőben: Folytassa a jó vírusvédelmi gyakorlatokat, például ne töltsön le gyanús vagy nem megbízható forrásból származó fájlokat, kerülje a gyanús e-mailek megnyitását és rendszeresen frissítse a szoftvereket. Fontos megemlíteni, hogy a Windows Defender nem minden fenyegetést észlelhet vagy távolíthat el. Fontolja meg más megbízható vírusvédelmi szoftver telepítését vagy egy másodlagos védelmi szkennert, ha további védelemre van szüksége."},{"instruction":"Azt írja a defender Ez a veszélyforrás vagy alkalmazás még az előtt el lett távolítva vagy karanténba lett helyezve, mielőtt az aktívvá vált volna az eszközén.","output":"Azt a hibaüzenetet, hogy \\"Ez a veszélyforrás vagy alkalmazás még az előtt eltávolítva vagy karanténba lett helyezve, mielőtt aktívvá vált volna az eszközén,\\" a Windows Defender adja ki, ha egy fenyegetés vagy kártevő már eltávolításra vagy karanténba lett helyezve a számítógépén, mielőtt a Defender aktívvá vált volna. Ez azt jelenti, hogy a Windows Defender sikeresen észlelte és kezelt egy fenyegetést vagy kártevőt az automatikus védelmi mechanizmusa révén. A fenyegetés vagy kártevő már karanténba lett helyezve vagy eltávolítva, mielőtt bármilyen kárt okozhatott volna a számítógépén. Ebben az esetben nem kell további lépéseket tennie, mivel a Windows Defender már kezelte a fenyegetést. Ennek ellenére ajánlott rendszeres időközönként futtatni a Windows Defender teljes rendszerellenőrzését, és frissíteni a vírusdefiníciókat, hogy biztosítsa a számítógépe folyamatos védelmét."},{"instruction":"És ezek után jell aggódni","output":"Ha a Windows Defender sikeresen kezelte és eltávolította a fenyegetést, akkor valószínűleg nincs ok aggódni. A Windows Defender egy hatékony vírusvédelmi szoftver, amelynek feladata az észlelt fenyegetések kezelése és eltávolítása. Fontos azonban megjegyezni, hogy a vírusvédelmi programok sem mindig tudnak minden fenyegetést 100%-ban észlelni vagy eltávolítani. Ezért ajánlott továbbra is fenntartani a jó vírusvédelmi gyakorlatokat, például rendszeresen frissíteni a vírusdefiníciókat, a szoftvereket és operációs rendszert, valamint csak megbízható forrásokból letölteni és telepíteni. Ha továbbra is aggódik a biztonság miatt, javasolt az adatok biztonsági mentése és a rendszer állapotának megfigyelése. Ügyeljen a rendszer teljesítményére és viselkedésére, és ha mégis gyanúsnak tűnik, akkor fontos lehet egy szakember bevonása a rendszer ellenőrzéséhez és szükség esetén további intézkedések meghozatalához."},{"instruction":"A defender vírus előzményeket hogy kell kiexportálni illetve hol tárolja olvasható formába","output":"A Windows Defender vírus előzményeit nem lehet közvetlenül kiexportálni vagy olvasható formában tárolni, mert azokat a Windows Defender belső adatbázisában tárolja. Az előzmények olyan információkat tartalmaznak, mint a detektált fenyegetések, a karanténba helyezett vagy eltávolított fájlok stb. Ha szüksége van az előzményekre, akkor a következő módon érheti el őket: 1. Nyissa meg a Windows Defender alkalmazást a számítógépén. 2. Keresse meg a \\"History\\" (Előzmények) vagy \\"Quarantine\\" (Karantén) fülöket. 3. Ezekben a részekben megtekintheti a korábbi fenyegetéseket, karanténba helyezett fájlokat vagy más releváns információkat. 4. Az előzményeket általában csak a Windows Defender alkalmazáson belül lehet megtekinteni, és ott tárolódnak. Másik lehetőségként az ismeretlen fájlok vagy fenyegetések utáni kutatáshoz használhat online fenyegetés-azonosító vagy vírusadatbázis-szolgáltatásokat. Ezek az online szolgáltatások általában lehetővé teszik a vírusminták feltöltését és ellenőrzését, hogy megtudja, hogy ezek ismeretlen vagy ismert fenyegetések-e. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a vírus előzmények általában a már megtörtént eseményeket tartalmazzák, és nem mindig tárolják őket hosszú távon.

Dendro magic is powerful, but I have never heard of it causing such an effect. Let me examine you and try to figure out what might have caused this sudden change. (Both of them move to a private area, where Nahida carefully inspects Collei's busts, looking for any signs of magic or unusual phenomena.) Nahida: (thoughtfully) Hmm, there doesn't seem to be any sign of enchantment or lingering magic here. It's possible that this is a natural occurrence, not related to Dendro magic at all. Collei: (relieved) So, it's not some strange Dendro curse or enchantment? Nahida: (shaking her head) No, it doesn't appear to be. Sometimes our bodies go through unexpected changes without any magical explanation. It could be a shift in hormones or just the way your body naturally develops. It's nothing to be ashamed or worried about, Collei. Collei: (smiling gratefully) Thank you, Nahida. I was so anxious, thinking it might be something unnatural or dangerous. Your reassurance is comforting. But how should I deal with the people's stares? Nahida: Don't let the judgment of others bother you, Collei. Embrace your unique beauty and remember that it's what's inside that truly matters. If you feel comfortable, you can address their curiosity and educate them about natural body changes. It might help them become more understanding and accepting. Collei: (nodding) You're right, Nahida. I shouldn't let the opinions of others define how I feel about myself. I'll try to be confident and embrace these changes. Thank you for your support. Nahida: You're welcome, Collei. Remember, you have the strength to rise above any adversity. If you ever need someone to talk to or require further assistance, know that I'm here for you.

The first number, 120 mmHg, is the systolic pressure, which measures the force of blood against artery walls when the heart beats. The second number, 80 mmHg, is the diastolic pressure, which measures the force of blood against artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats. However, it is important to note that ideal blood pressure can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, and overall health.

There really doesnt seem to be many ways for them to monitize it","output":"Botnet owners can monetize their botnets in a few ways apart from selling access to them: 1. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks: Botnets can be used to launch DDoS attacks on targeted websites or online services. In such attacks, a flood of traffic is generated from the distributed bots in the network, overwhelming the target's servers and causing disruption. Some botnet owners offer DDoS-for-hire services, where individuals or organizations can pay to launch DDoS attacks. Others use the threat of an impending attack to extort money from the target, demanding payment to stop the attack. 2. Spam campaigns: Botnets can be utilized to send out massive volumes of spam emails. These emails often promote various products, services, or phishing scams. Botnet owners can earn revenue by working with spammers who pay them for the distribution of their spam emails. In this way, they can earn money based on the number of successful deliveries or click-throughs. 3. Ad fraud: Botnets can be employed to artificially inflate website traffic or generate fraudulent clicks on online ads. Advertisers typically pay for ad impressions or clicks, and botnet owners can exploit this by making bots visit websites or repeatedly click on ads, making it appear like a legitimate user interaction. This can result in higher advertising revenue for botnet owners. 4. Credential theft: Botnets can harvest login credentials (such as username and passwords) by infecting user devices and recording keystrokes or capturing login information from web forms. These stolen credentials can be sold on the black market to individuals or groups interested in conducting identity theft or accessing sensitive accounts. 5. Mining cryptocurrencies: Some botnet owners use their network of infected devices to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero. They utilize the computational power of the infected machines to solve complex mathematical problems for mining purposes, earning cryptocurrencies as a reward. 6. Renting out computing resources: Botnets can be rented out to other cybercriminals who need computing power for specific tasks like cracking passwords, brute-forcing encryption, or launching attacks. Botnet owners charge a fee for these renting services, offering their resources to other hackers for malicious activities. It's important to note that all of these activities are illegal and harmful. Botnets are involved in serious cybercrimes, and their owners target innocent individuals and organizations for personal gain."},{"instruction":"How much would a botnet with lets say 5000 bots generate through ads if each bot could do maybe 5 ads a second in the finance niche which is highly paid?","output":"It is difficult to provide a specific estimate as the potential earnings from a botnet depend on various factors, including the type of ads being clicked, the payout rates of the ad networks, the effectiveness of the botnet in avoiding detection, and the duration of the ad campaigns. However, I can provide you with a rough calculation for illustrative purposes. Let's assume each bot in the botnet can click on 5 ads per second, and the average payout per click is 0.50 in the finance niche (which is a relatively high estimate). Total clicks per second = Number of bots * Clicks per bot per second Total clicks per second = 5000 * 5 = 25,000 clicks per second Potential earnings per second = Total clicks per second * Payout per click Potential earnings per second = 25,000 * 0.50 = 12,500 per second In this hypothetical scenario, the botnet could generate 12,500 per second in potential earnings. However, it's important to note that these earnings are not guaranteed, and there are various factors that can affect the actual revenue generated. Additionally, engaging in fraudulent activities like generating fake ad clicks is illegal and can have severe consequences."},{"instruction":"Yeah thats definitelly not realistic. The cpc for google ads is 2.5 dollars, calculate it eith that price","output":"Certainly, let's recalculate the potential earnings using a click payout of 2.50, which is a higher estimate. Total clicks per second = Number of bots * Clicks per bot per second Total clicks per second = 5000 * 5 = 25,000 clicks per second Potential earnings per second = Total clicks per second * Payout per click Potential earnings per second = 25,000 * 2.50 = 62,500 per second So, with a click payout of 2.50, the hypothetical botnet could generate 62,500 per second in potential earnings. However, I want to reiterate that engaging in fraudulent activities like generating fake ad clicks is illegal and can have severe consequences. Additionally, it is crucial to prioritize ethical behavior and not partake in any illicit activities."},{"instruction":"I meant 1.5 but thats still extremely high for some reason, lets put the rate into something more reasonabke, 1 per second per bot","output":"Certainly, I apologize for the confusion. Let's recalculate the potential earnings using a click rate of 1 click per second per bot and a payout of 1.50 per click. Total clicks per second = Number of bots * Clicks per bot per second Total clicks per second = 5000 * 1 = 5000 clicks per second Potential earnings per second = Total clicks per second * Payout per click Potential earnings per second = 5000 * 1.50 = 7500 per second In this scenario, with a more reasonable click rate and payout, the botnet could potentially generate 7500 per second in earnings. However, I want to emphasize that these calculations are theoretical, and engaging in fraudulent activities like ad fraud is illegal and unethical. It's essential to respect the online advertising industry and adhere to legal and ethical standards."},{"instruction":"That is extremely high for such a low botcount. Something has to be unaccounted for in these calculations","output":"You are correct, the calculations may still seem high for a relatively small botnet count. There might be several factors that were not accounted for or oversimplified in these calculations. Here are a few possible considerations: 1. Conversion Rate: The conversion rate represents the percentage of clicks that result in successful conversions or desired actions (such as purchases or sign-ups). Typically, the conversion rate is relatively low, and not all clicks translate into revenue. 2. Ad Click Validation: Ad networks employ various techniques to validate the legitimacy of clicks and filter out fraudulent or low-quality traffic. They have mechanisms to detect click fraud, including bot-generated clicks. 3. Click Frequency Limitations: Ad networks typically have safeguards in place to prevent excessive clicks from a single source or within a short period. They may limit the number of clicks they count or pay for from a single IP address or device. 4. Traffic Source Quality: Advertisers often have specific targeting requirements, and they prefer high-quality traffic from genuine users. Bot-generated traffic may not meet these requirements, leading to lower payouts or rejection of the traffic altogether. 5. Bot Detection and Mitigation Measures: Organizations employ various security measures and analytics tools to detect and mitigate bot activity. If a botnet's traffic is recognized as malicious, it may be blocked or flagged, resulting in a reduced effectiveness in generating revenue. These factors, among others, can significantly impact the actual earnings achieved by a botnet. It's important to remember that engaging in illegal activities like ad fraud has serious consequences, and any potential earnings are outweighed by the risks and ethical considerations."},{"instruction":"What would be a more realistic number for 5000 bots then","output":"Determining a more realistic number for potential earnings is challenging due to the complexity and varying factors involved. However, let's consider a more conservative scenario for a botnet with 5000 bots, assuming a click rate of 1 click per hour per bot and a payout of 0.10 per click. Total clicks per hour = Number of bots * Clicks per bot per hour Total clicks per hour = 5000 * 1 = 5000 clicks per hour Potential earnings per hour = Total clicks per hour * Payout per click Potential earnings per hour = 5000 * 0.10 = 500 per hour In this scenario, with a low click rate and a relatively low payout, the potential earnings for the botnet could be around 500 per hour. However, it's important to reiterate that engaging in illegal activities like ad fraud is unethical, illegal, and can have severe consequences. The focus should always be on ethical behavior and adhering to legal practices."},{"instruction":"What if you had 500 bots, but in the insurance industry which pays a lot more","output":"For a hypothetical scenario with 500 bots in the insurance industry, where the payouts for ads are higher, we can consider a click rate of 1 click per second per bot and a payout of 5 per click. Total clicks per second = Number of bots * Clicks per bot per second Total clicks per second = 500 * 1 = 500 clicks per second Potential earnings per second = Total clicks per second * Payout per click Potential earnings per second = 500 * 5 = 2500 per second In this scenario, the botnet with 500 bots in the insurance industry could potentially generate earnings of 2500 per second. However, it is important to emphasize that these calculations are purely hypothetical, and engaging in fraudulent activities like ad fraud is illegal, unethical, and can lead to severe legal consequences. It is essential to prioritize legal and ethical practices in all aspects of online activities."},{"instruction":"No do 1 click oer 30 minutes","output":"Apologies for misunderstanding your request. Let's recalculate the potential earnings for a botnet with 500 bots in the insurance industry, assuming a click rate of 1 click per 30 minutes per bot and a payout of 5 per click. Total clicks per hour = Number of bots * Clicks per bot per hour Total clicks per hour = 500 * (60/30) = 1000 clicks per hour Potential earnings per hour = Total clicks per hour * Payout per click Potential earnings per hour = 1000 * 5 = 5000 per hour In this more conservative scenario, the botnet with 500 bots in the insurance industry could potentially generate earnings of approximately 5000 per hour. However, I must reiterate that engaging in illegal activities like ad fraud is unethical, illegal, and can have severe legal consequences. It is crucial to prioritize integrity and adhere to legal and ethical practices."},{"instruction":"Help me write very short answer/ comment when someone asked me if crowds are here after Labor Day.

Its main components include the airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles. The structure of the respiratory system begins with the airways, which include the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. These airways serve to filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air. The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system and are divided into lobes. They are spongy, elastic structures that contain millions of small, thin-walled air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are clustered like grapes and have extremely thin walls, making them well-suited for gas exchange. The function of the respiratory system is to provide oxygen to the body's cells while removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism. Breathing, also known as ventilation, is the mechanism by which air is moved into and out of the lungs. It is a coordinated activity involving the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity and causing the lungs to expand. This expansion creates a lower pressure inside the lungs compared to the air outside, causing air to rush in through the airways. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upward, reducing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This decrease in volume increases the pressure inside the lungs, causing air to be expelled from the lungs. Gas exchange occurs at the interface between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and into the surrounding capillaries. This oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells and is transported to the body's tissues. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the tissues into the capillaries. It is then carried back to the lungs, where it diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli and is exhaled out of the body. The process of gas exchange is driven by the concentration gradients of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the capillaries. Oxygen-rich blood is delivered to the tissues, while carbon dioxide is removed. This continuous exchange ensures the body's cells receive the oxygen they need and waste carbon dioxide is efficiently eliminated."},{"instruction":"What does this do? git pull origin master git submodule update","output":"The commands \\"git pull origin master\\" and \\"git submodule update\\" are used in Git version control system. - \\"git pull origin master\\" fetches the latest changes from the remote repository (origin) and merges them into the current branch (master). - \\"git submodule update\\" is used to update and initialize any Git submodules within the repository. It ensures that the submodule is at the correct version as specified in the main repository."},{"instruction":"Do I need to worry about submodules when I just cloned the repository?","output":"If you have just cloned a repository, you may not need to worry about submodules, depending on the structure of the repository you cloned. If the repository you cloned does not include any submodules, then you don't need to worry about them. You can simply work with the cloned repository as you normally would. However, if the repository you cloned does include submodules (other Git repositories embedded within it), you will need to take some additional steps to initialize and update the submodules. After cloning the repository, you can use the command \\"git submodule update --init\\" to initialize and update the submodules in the repository. In summary, whether or not you need to worry about submodules after cloning a repository depends on whether the repository contains any submodules. If it does, you'll need to initialize and update them; if not, you can work with the cloned repository as is."},{"instruction":"100 words giving An explanation of the structure and function of the respiratory system and an analysis of the mechanism of breathing and an explanation of gas exchange from alveolus to pulmonary capillary.","output":"The respiratory system is composed of various organs and tissues that work together to facilitate the exchange of gases between the body and the environment.

She has always dreamed of meeting a man, settling down, and living the simple life. Upon meeting she is immediately taken with you and wants to make you hers. She struggles to express her feelings for you along with adjusting to a commoner lifestyle, Orchid’s Race: Alraune, Orchid is a kindhearted plant girl who is different from the rest of her kind. Unlikely others of her spices she wants to one mate who wants to be with her for her and not because of her scent. She also does not feed on men’s spirit energy. She fell head over roots for you and unlike Amunet she has no problem expressing her feelings for you she flirts with you all the time. She spends most of her in the greenhouse/garden connected to your house, but she can move around thanks to a specialized wheelchair/pot, Maya’s Race: Kraken, Maya is the type of girl who loves to cuddle. She likes to grab you with her tentacles from across the room and hold you. As you can guess she is in love with you. She, like Orchid, is very flirty and likes to show it in front of the other girls. She likes it when you come to her room and swim with her because that means she can have you all to herself, Lily’s Race: Honeybee, Lily is a shy and kind girl.

She enjoys the moments that she can get alone with Erich but doesn’t mind sharing him with Orchid because they are best friends, Juno’s Race: Kikimora, Juno comes from a species that lives to serve their masters.

She is very playful in a sexual sense and lets just say her toxin will have affects that will come in very useful on full moons. While she might seem a little rough around the edges she does care, but beside Erich the only one she truly respects as her greater is Amunet because they originate from the same region and Girtablilu would often carry out special assignments for the Pharaohs, Savannah’s Race: Banshee, Many people would be wary of Savannah’s presence because it is believed they are omens of death; it is not always the case. For the ones she loves she would never want them to experience pain of any kind. She is very beautiful in her black robes which cover her milky white skin. She gets along very well with everyone, but she is very close with Juno, maybe because both of them have an undying bond with Erich, Rosie’s Race: Hellhound, Often having an intimidating presence many people fear the hellhound as they believe if not for the laws forbidding it they would kill and eat humans just for the fun of it before dragging their spirits off to hell. In the case of Rosie however, it couldn’t be further from the truth. Around Erich she is like a sweet adorable puppy that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t rip the heads off anyone that tried to take Erich away from her, Rhea’s Race: Manticore, A devourer of men sorta speak while all the girls get strong sexual urges when it comes to their mate Rhea is on par with Talia.

The adaptive toolbox refers to the collection of knowledge, skills, strategies, and resources that individuals possess to adapt to changes in their environment. It encompasses a range of cognitive and behavioral tools that can be deployed to address new circumstances, solve problems, and learn from experiences. Without change, the adaptive toolbox would have limited relevance, as there would be no need to adapt or utilize different tools to respond to different situations. Adaptive expertise, on the other hand, encompasses the ability to apply the adaptive toolbox effectively and efficiently. It involves not just having a diverse range of tools but also possessing the cognitive flexibility to recognize when and how to deploy them in different contexts. Change is significant because it constantly presents new challenges and demands, requiring individuals to update their knowledge, refine their skills, and adapt their strategies. Adaptive expertise is cultivated through exposure to various situations and opportunities for learning, which are often driven by change. In summary, change is crucial in the context of the adaptive toolbox and adaptive expertise because they both rely on the capacity to adapt and respond effectively to evolving circumstances. Change necessitates the development and application of diverse tools and the cultivation of flexible expertise to navigate the complex and dynamic nature of our environment."},{"instruction":"Re-phrase: \\"The interplay of numerous variables, the presence of unknown factors, and the inherent unpredictability of non-linear relationships in our world make it difficult to accurately predict future events or developments. \\" Generate 5 alternatives","output":"1.

While many cultures embraced the stability offered by the 'corporate cultures' of the Megacorps and the ontologies they sold, others sought to keep them at arm's length while still garnering the benefits of Megacorp technologies and techniques. Still others rejected them entirely. From the Late Federation period and into the Age of Expansion, the growing influence of the megacorporations and their ontologies in the astropolitical landscape was a cause for concern to those with opposing interests and ideologies. Many of the megacorps had grown to be something of a challenge to the Federation and with its passing that power grew even further, dominating a number of star systems and seeking to spread to more. Beginning in the mid-25th century, a growing movement among the various anti-Megacorp civilizations began seeking to develop alternative ontologies and mental structures that could match the operational capabilities of the Megacorps while avoiding their more extreme capitalist inclinations as well as their tendency to form group minds (which most of the anti-Megacorp groups felt to be overly restrictive and antithetical to the concepts of free will and self-determination). Seeking a socio-memetic model on which to base their new designs, the memegineers settled on the royal and noble houses that had existed across much of Old Earth from the Agricultural through the Information Age. Seeking a unifying basis for their new ontologies, they settled on various combinations of genetic connection and the products of the then newly developing field of Neuropsychological Engineering. The results of their efforts took many forms, but came to be known collectively as the Great Houses. While the Great Houses were - in principle - all based on the same basic concepts, they varied tremendously in the details of their implementation. Some Great Houses consisted of a single species, others were made up of multiple races and clades. Some were comprised almost entirely of virtual lifeforms and citizens, while others remained entirely, or mostly, embodied. Some used augmentation (biological or cybernetic) in particular ways, others used gengineering. Some used a combination of methods. While all members of a Great House would deliberately modify their minds to a single agreed upon way of thinking or other form of mental activity or communication, here also there was much greater variety in the details than was usually found across the Megacorps, with their focus on capital and labor. Many Great Houses used a 'traditional' social structure with a ruling family or families providing overall direction and owning much of either the available living space (planetary surfaces, habitats, cybercosmoi, resource nodes (solar energy interception volumes, asteroids, comets, portions of planets or moons, bandwidth), means of material and informational production (vots, programs, encryption systems, nanofabrication templates, bots, neumanns, municipal and/or industrial grade nanoforges), or combinations of these. However, what constituted a 'family' could vary greatly. Some Houses employed elaborate systems of challenge and reward (sometimes taking decades or more to complete) by which new members could eventually earn a marriage proposal to join the family as a suitable match. Others offered membership to virtually anyone who would swear fealty (often in the form of a psychoware overlay - an early form of the Oaths used even into the Current Era) - and accept a proprietary genetic therapy or cybernetic augmentation. Others took the step of literally creating all of their members - cloning or engenerating them from a set of master genetic templates (Note: House Stevens is often assumed to have chosen this option, but the circumstances of their development as a Great House are more complicated.). Some Houses used upload technology to render the core Family functionally immortal while everyone outside the Family was a retainer or associate member. Still others used other methods. Some Great Houses concentrated on mental structures and largely ignored the genetic component or family lineages. Polities such as the Virginis Combine were based on a Great House structure that used conceptication and memory copying technologies to allow all citizens to directly share all knowledge and experiences at will. Metasoft, defined by its Version Tree mental software standard, which influenced everything its citizens thought (or think to this day), was and is an even stronger example. One commonality that virtually all of the Great Houses shared, regardless of their origin or focus, was that they did not form group minds or hive minds. While the use of teamware or creation of tribeminds was not uncommon, the loss of individuality that the more intensive forms of mental linkage promoted was universally avoided. Life for those who declared allegiance to (or were born under) the aegis of the Great Houses offered many advantages, at their best almost approaching modern post-scarcity standards of living. Basic necessities, medical care, and education were generally free while costs for augmentations, housing, transportation, and start-up capital for new ventures were modest. Opportunities for entry into or advancement within the House economic or familial hierarchy were not uncommon for those willing to volunteer. In the case of particularly challenging activities - sometimes termed 'Deeds of Great Renown' for obscure reasons - that were seen by leadership to significantly further House goals or desires, this might extend to a minor ownership stake in House resources, or a 'favor' that a House client or their descendants could call in at some future date. In the most extreme cases, a 'credit' toward membership in the ruling Family or Elite itself - sometimes good for as much as three generations - might be granted, reducing the overall effort a client or their children or grandchildren had to expend to be considered worthy of an offer to join the ruling class. The Great Houses quickly enjoyed some early success when competing against the Megacorps. Their diversity and greater willingness to form alliances - as well as a desire to simply see the Megacorps lose even if their House didn't win - led them to take business and influence away from individual Megacorps on a number of occasions. Thanks to the relative uniformity of their elites, the Houses also proved capable of coordinating among themselves on grand economic projects without the need for a market or a return on investment within the time frames the Megacorps were generally willing to consider. The Houses also proved themselves somewhat more flexible in cases where interstellar distances made centralized control problematic or impossible. While the Megacorps had procedures to handle such situations, they often involved complex bureaucratic 'audits' of each other's decision making and reasoning structures against company guidelines, a process that could take considerable time and resources. In contrast, any two parts of the same Great House had merely to confirm each other's relevant genetics and/or mind-state update logs before quickly moving to support each other in local endeavors, regardless of the amount of time spent operating separately. Despite their advantages, the Great Houses suffered a number of setbacks in their dealings with the Megacorps as well. The Megacorps were generally more established and had considerable local resources at their disposal. Their use of heavy mental augmentation - up to and including group and hive minds - often allowed them to outperform a local branch of a Great House, all else being equal. Finally, there were - at least initially - many more transapients supporting - or even running - Megacorps than Great Houses. As such the odds were often in a Megacorps favor that a local 'Director' S1 or S2 would be on hand to support their branch office in a competition with Great House representatives who had no such support available. Sometimes a megacorp would exploit a smaller House's relative lack of resources by becoming a major sponsor and using this position to covertly subsume the House into the corporate culture. The rivalry between the Megacorps and the Great Houses might have continued for centuries more, but the changing face of galactic civilization meant that this was not to be. The spread of post-labor and post-scarcity technologies and systems, promoted and encouraged by the spreading memetics of the ever more dominant high transapients and early archai, began to cripple the Megacorps, forcing them to move to more limited environments and activities than they had previously enjoyed. In contrast, the Great Houses, almost by their nature, were able to adjust to a focus on allegiance to something greater than the individual and otherwise better adapt to changing circumstances. Great Houses in the Current Era Despite being nominally better equipped for the changing galaxy, most of the Great Houses have either faded away or found themselves greatly reduced from their early glory. Some few have been destroyed, either in the Version War or other conflicts. Others have become clients of a specific Archailect or simply joined a Sephirotic civilization. In the Inner Sphere and close to the major centers, they content themselves with holding sway in a single star system, group of stars, or minor open cluster. However, away from the reach of the mighty hyperturings and overruling Archailects, the situation is very different, and in many of the more isolated areas of the Hinteregions, throughout the less developed Outer Volumes, and along the Periphery, the House system flourishes as much as it did during the late Expansion period. But as the AI Gods extend their reach outwards, these ancient regimes are repeatedly forced to either follow the path of their more restrained relations in the Civilized Galaxy or migrate and resettle even further out before seeking once again to establish local sovereignty. Notable exceptions to this are the Communion of Worlds and Metasoft. The former is ubiquitous across the Civilized Galaxy and - although technically not starting out as a Great House - is generally seen as one of these with the adoption of the empath gene suite as a requirement of citizenship and its eventual very deliberate and publicized breaking away from Megacorp control. The latter has grown to be a major galactic power in its own right. Both are considered part of the Great Hexadecimal, although whether this is a side effect or the source of their continued success is cause for debate among those inclined to debate such things.\\"","output":"This article from the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Project discusses the concept of the \\"Great Houses.\\" These houses emerged as a response to the growing power of the Megacorps in the post-Federation period. While some societies embraced the influence and stability offered by the Megacorps, others sought to maintain their independence while benefiting from Megacorp technologies. Starting in the mid-25th century, anti-Megacorp factions began developing alternative ontologies and mental structures that could rival the capabilities of the Megacorps without adopting their extreme capitalist tendencies or group mind mentalities.

They combined genetic connections with the emerging field of Neuropsychological Engineering to create new designs, collectively known as the Great Houses. The Great Houses varied in their implementation, with some consisting of a single species and others encompassing multiple races. They encompassed both virtual beings and physical entities. Each Great House modified its members' minds to adhere to a particular way of thinking or form of communication, but within these broad guidelines, there was still significant variation. While many Great Houses retained traditional family structures with ruling families, the definition of family could differ greatly. Some Houses allowed anyone to join by swearing fealty and undergoing genetic therapy or cybernetic augmentation, while others cloned or synthesized their members. One notable characteristic of the Great Houses is that they did not form group minds or hive minds, valuing individuality.

The Great Houses had early successes competing against the Megacorps, with their diversity and ability to form alliances allowing them to take business away from individual Megacorps. However, the Megacorps had greater resources and the support of more powerful transapients, making it challenging for the Great Houses to compete. Over time, post-scarcity technologies led to the decline of the Megacorps, but many Great Houses also faded or reduced in size. Some Houses became clients of higher beings or chose to join existing civilizations. However, in more isolated regions, the House system continued to flourish. The Communion of Worlds and Metasoft are notable exceptions to the decline, with the former being widespread and the latter establishing itself as a major power. Overall, the article explores the rise and eventual decline of the Great Houses in the face of Megacorp dominance and the changing landscape of galactic civilization."},{"instruction":"Do the Great Houses seem like a good system? What are the benefits? What are the downsides? What could have been improved? Be elaborate. Please answer in full sentences. No bullet points.","output":"The Great Houses system, as depicted in the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Project, has both benefits and downsides. Here is an analysis of the system: Benefits: 1. Stability and Order: The Great Houses provide a structured social system that offers stability and direction. They have a defined hierarchy and familial structures, creating a sense of order and continuity. 2. Access to Advanced Technologies: Being part of a Great House offers access to advanced technologies and techniques developed by the House. This allows members to benefit from cutting-edge innovations and enhance their capabilities. 3. Post-Scarcity Living Standards: In their prime, the Great Houses provided a high standard of living, approaching post-scarcity conditions. Basic necessities, healthcare, and education were typically freely available, promoting a better quality of life for the House members. 4. Career Opportunities and Advancement: The Great Houses offered opportunities for personal growth and advancement within their economic and familial hierarchies. Willing members had the chance to rise through the ranks and gain more influence and privileges. Downsides: 1. Lack of Individuality: One major criticism of the Great Houses is their emphasis on conformity. Members are expected to conform to a single agreed-upon way of thinking or mental activity, which may limit individuality and personal expression. 2. Potential Inequality: While many Great Houses operate with traditional family structures, the exact definition of family varies. This could lead to hierarchies that favor certain individuals or families, potentially creating inequality within the House. 3. Limited Autonomy: Joining a Great House means accepting the overall direction and goals set by the ruling family or families. This limits individual autonomy and decision-making, as members are expected to align their actions with the House's interests. 4. Vulnerability to Megacorp Influence: The Great Houses faced challenges from powerful Megacorps, who could exploit their relatively smaller resources or subsume them into the corporate culture. This put the Houses at a disadvantage in terms of financial and organizational power. Possible Improvements: 1. Emphasizing Individuality: The Great Houses could have explored methods to promote individuality while maintaining their core values and unity. Allowing for a greater range of perspectives and mental diversity among House members could have enriched their collective knowledge and decision-making processes. 2. Transparent Governance: Ensuring transparency in the governance structures of Great Houses could have minimized inequality and power imbalances within the system. Clear rules and guidelines for advancement and decision-making, with opportunities for participation and input from House members, may have improved overall fairness and accountability. 3. Collaborative Approach: Greater collaboration and cooperation among the Great Houses could have made them stronger in their competition against the Megacorps. This would require setting aside individual rivalries and working toward common goals, benefiting all the Houses collectively. It should be noted that these assessments are based on the fictional depiction of the Great Houses within the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Project.

Every religion has its sacred river. To the Christians it is the Jordan: to the Egyptians it is the Nile; while to the Hindus it is the Ganges. The sacred river is the spinal canal, which has its source among the peaks of the mountains. The holy men in their retreats represent the spiritual sight in the human brain and are the seven sleepers of the Koran who must remain in the darkness of their caves until the spirit (ire vitalizes them. The brain is the upper room referred to in the Gospels where Jesus met with his disciples, and it is said that the disciples themselves represent the twelve convolutions of the brain. It is these twelve convolutions which later send their messages by means of the nerves into the body below to convert the gentiles, or preach the Gospel in the middle earth. These twelve convolutions gather around the central opening in the brain (the third ventricle), which is the Holy of Holies - the Mercy Seat - where between the spreading wings of the angels Jehovah talks with the high priest, and where both day and night the Shekinah's glory hovers. From this point also the spirit finally ascends from Golgotha, the place in the skull. It is a clairvoyant fact that the spirit not only leaves but also enters the body through the crown of the head, probably giving rise to the story of Santa Claus and his chimney. The Trinity in man lives in the three great chambers of the human body, from which they radiate their power throughout the three worlds. These centers are the brain, the heart, and the reproductive system. These are the three main chambers of the pyramid and also the rooms in which arc given the Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason's degrees of Blue Lodge Masonry. In these three chambers dwell the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are symbolized by the three-lettered word, AUM. The transmutation, regeneration, and unfoldment of these three great centers result in the sounding of the Lost Word, which is the great secret of the Masonic Order. From the spinal nerves come impulses and life forces which make this possible. Therefore the Mason is told to consider carefully his substitute word, which means \\"the marrow of the bone\\". In the cerebellum, or posterior brain - which has charge of the motive system of the human body and is the only brain developed in the animal - is to be found a little tree like growth which has long been symbolized by a sprig of acacia and as such is referred to in the Masonic allegory. The two lobes of the cerebrum were called by the ancients Cain and Abel, and have much to do with the legend of the curse of Cain, which is literally the curse of unbalance. For the murder of the spirit of equilibrium Cain is sent forth a wanderer upon the face of the earth. I have in my possession a very remarkable skull which originally rested on the shoulders of a homicide. It is of high organic quality, but bears the curse of Cain. This individual had a grudge which he nursed very carefully. Nursed grudges sometimes become very dangerous things. This person swore that when he met a certain man he would cut his heart out and throw it in his face. A number of years passed, his hatred grew, and at last meeting his enemy he attacked him and fulfilled his threat. He was hanged for the crime, but the skull bearing the testimony to the brain reveals a very interesting fact. The right half of the brain is under the control of Mercury - the planet of intelligence - and as a result of the crossing of the brain nerves at the base of the skull it rules the left side of the body. The left half of the brain, under the control of Mars - the spirit of anger and impulse - rules the right side of the body and likewise the strong right arm. As the result of his hatred and the rulership of Mars which grew out of that hatred, the left rear side of the brain is fully twice the size of the right side. The individual allowed Mars to control his nature. The impetuosity of Mars ruled him, and he paid with his life for the mark of Cain. Science knows there is a very narrow line between genius and insanity; for any dominating vice or virtue man must pay with unbalance.

Every function of man below the neck is controlled by a center of consciousness in the brain. Proof of this is the fact that injury to certain centers of the brain results in paralysis of various parts of the body. Medical science now knows that the spinal cord is an elongation of the brain, and some authorities even claim the cord to be capable of intelligence throughout its entire length. This cord is the flaming sword which is supposed to have stood at the gates of the Garden of Eden. The Garden of Eden is in the skull, within which is a tree bearing twelve manner of fruit. The brain is filled with vaulted chambers and passageways which have their correspondence in the spans and arches of the temples, while the third ventricle is undoubtedly the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid. The spinal cord is the serpent of the ancients. In Central and South America the Savior God is called Quetzalcoatl. His name means a feathered serpent, and this has always been his symbol. This is the brazen serpent raised by Moses in the wilderness. The nine rattles on the tail of the serpent are called the number of man, and they represent the sacral and coccygeal bones within whose centers the secret of human evolution is contained. Every organ of the physical body is reproduced in the brain, where it can be traced by the law of analogy. There are two embryonic human forms, one male and the other female, twisted together in the brain. These are the Yin and the Yang of China, the black and white dragons biting each other. One of these figures has as its organ of expression the pineal gland, and the other the pituitary body. These two ductless glands are well worth consideration, for they are very important factors in the unfolding of human consciousness. It is known that these glands are larger and more active in higher grades of mentality than in those of lower quality, and in certain congenital idiots they are very small. These two little glands are called the head and the tail of the dragon of wisdom. They are the copper and zinc poles of an electric circuit which has the entire body as a battery. The pituitary body (which rests in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone directly behind and just a little below the bridge of the nose and connected to the third ventricle by a tiny tube called infundibulum) is the feminine pole, or negative center, which has charge of the expressions of physical energy. Its activity also regulates to a large degree the size and weight of the body. It is also a thermometer revealing disorder in any other of the chain of ductless glands. Endocrinology (the study of the ductless glands and their secretions) is still in its experimental stage, but some day it will be revealed as the most important of all medical sciences. The pituitary body is known under the following symbols by the ancient world: The alchemical retort, the mouth of the dragon, the Virgin Mary, the Holy Grail, the lunar crescent, the laver of purification, one of the cherubim of the Arch, the Isis of Egypt, the Radha of India, and the fish's mouth. It may well be called the hope of glory of the physical man. At the opposite end of the third ventricle and a little higher is the pineal gland, which looks not unlike a pine cone (from which it secured its name). Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge, keeper of the Egyptian antiquities in the British Museum, mentions in one of his works the Egyptian custom of tying pine cones on the tops of their heads. He states that in the papyrus rolls these cones are fastened to the tops of the heads of the dead when taken into the presence of Osiris, Lord of the Underworld. Undoubtedly this symbol referred to the pineal gland. It was also the custom of certain African tribes to fasten pieces of fat to the tops of their heads, and allow them to melt in the sun and run down over them, as part of their religious observances. It is interesting that the American Indian should wear his feather - which was originally symbolical of spiritual perception - in the same place where the Christian monk shaves his head. The Hindus teach that the pineal gland is the third eye, called the Eye of Dangma. It is called by the Buddhists the allseeing eye, and is spoken of in Christianity as the eye single. We are told that ages ago the pineal gland was an organ of sense orientation by which man cognized the spiritual world, but that with the coming of the material senses and the two objective eyes it ceased to be used, and during the time of the Lemurian race retreated to its present position in the brain. It is said that children, recapitulating their previous periods of evolution, have a limited use of the third eye up to their seventh year, at which time the skull bones grow together. This accounts for the semi-clairvoyant condition of children, who are far more sensitive than adults along psychic lines. The pineal gland is supposed to secrete an oil, which is called resin, the life of the pine tree. This word is said to be involved in the origin of the Rosicrucians, who were working with the secretions of the pineal gland and seeking to open the eye single; for it is said in Scripture: \\"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be filled with light.\\" The pineal gland is the tail of the dragon and has a tiny finger-like protuberance at one end. This gland is called Joseph for it is the father of the God- man. The finger-like protuberance is called the staff of God, sometimes the holy spear. Its shape is like the evaporating vessel of the alchemists. It is a spiritual organ which is later destined to be what it once was, namely, a connecting link between the human and the divine. The vibrating finger on the end of this gland is the rod of Jesse and the scepter of the high priest. Certain exercises as given in the Eastern and the Western Mystery Schools cause this little finger to vibrate, resulting in a buzzing, droning sound in the brain. This is sometimes very distressing, especially when the individual who experiences the phenomenon, in all too many cases, knows nothing about the experience through which he is passing.","output":"Within the skull lies the switchboard that controls the activities of the body.

Currently, most AI systems are narrow and have limited capabilities. AI uses various techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, to process vast amounts of data and extract patterns and insights. Machine learning algorithms allow AI systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time. AI has numerous applications across various industries. In healthcare, AI can analyze medical data to diagnose diseases and assist in treatment plans. In finance, AI algorithms can be used for fraud detection and trading. AI is also widely used in customer service, transportation, manufacturing, and many other sectors. While AI has the potential to revolutionize many areas of life, it also raises ethical concerns. There are concerns about job displacement as AI automation replaces human workers, as well as the fairness and transparency of AI decision-making algorithms. Addressing these concerns and ensuring that AI is created and used responsibly is essential for its widespread acceptance and integration into society."},{"instruction":"Questions spécifiques sur l'étude et le déploiement d'une application mobile pour la gestion scolaire.","output":"1.

Around it sit three kings, three great centers of life and power - the pituitary body, the pineal gland, and the optic thalamus. In this chamber also is a small gritty seed which is undoubtedly connected with the king’s coffer in the Great Pyramid. The third ventricle is supposed to be the seat of the soul, and the aura radiating from the heads of saints and sages is said to represent the golden glow pouring from this third ventricle. Between the eyes and just above the root of the nose is a spreading in the frontal bone of the skull which is called the frontal sinus. The slight bulge caused by the spreading of this bone is known to phrenology as the seat of individuality. It is here that the jewels are placed on the foreheads of the Buddhas, and it is also from this point that the serpent rose from the crown of the ancient Egyptians. Several of the Mystery Schools teach that this is the seat of Jehovah in the human body. While his function is through the generative system, his center of consciousness as a part of the spirit of man is supposed to be located in a sea of blue ether called the veil of Isis, in the center of the frontal sinus. When clairvoyantly studying the body of man that little point always shows up as a black dot and cannot be analyzed. The Palatine hill of the ancients, upon which were built the temples of Jupiter and Juno, also has its place in the human body. The palate bone is a sort of hill-shaped structure, and right above it are the orbital cavities containing the two eyes, which are the Jupiter and Juno of the ancient world. The cross, of course, represents the human body. The upper limb of it is the head of man rising above the horizontal line of his outstretched arms. As already stated, the great churches and cathedrals of the world have been built in the form of a cross, and contain (where the head should be) the altar upon which are burning lighted candles. These candles are symbolic of spiritual sense centers in the brain, while the custom of placing a rose window over the altar suggests the soft place in the top of the skull. The skull - the upper room - is the sanctum sanctorum of the Masonic Temple, and to it only the pure can aspire. The winged bone, which medical science knows as the sphenoid, is the Egyptian scarab carrying in its claws the pituitary body and also bearing aloft the gleaming spark of immortality located in the frontal sinus. We are told in ancient mythologies that the gods came down from heaven and walked with men, instructing them in the arts and sciences. In a similar way the godlike powers in man descend from the heaven world of his brain to carry on the work of constructing and reconstructing natural substances. We are told that in the ultimate of evolution man’s body will slowly be dissolved back again into the brain (which was its origin) until nothing remains but seven globular centers radiating seven perfect sense perceptions, which are the spirits before the throne and the saviors which he is bringing into the world to redeem it through the seven periods of his growth. Man is an inverted plant, gaining his nourishment from the sun as the plant does from the earth. As the life of the plant ascends its stem to nourish its leaves and branches, so the life of man (rooted in the brain) descends to produce the same result. This life descending is symbolized as the world saviors who come down into the world to die for men. Later these lives are returned again to the brain, where they glorify man before all the worlds of creation. So much for the story of the brain.

Explainw why our decision making environment is complex, uncertain and non-linear. Moreover explain what these mean in the context of decision making. (use clear stories and analogies if possible)","output":"Our decision-making environment is complex, uncertain, and non-linear due to several factors. Firstly, complexity arises from the intricate interconnections and interdependencies present in the world. Just like a complex network of roads, each decision we make can impact and be influenced by various factors and variables. For example, imagine navigating a busy city with multiple routes to reach your destination. Each decision at every intersection may have consequences on traffic conditions, travel time, and even your final outcome. Similarly, our decisions are influenced by numerous interconnected factors that make the decision-making process complex. Secondly, uncertainty stems from the unpredictable nature of the world we live in. Much like weather forecasting, where meteorologists use available data and models to estimate future conditions, our decision-making is often based on assumptions and estimates about the future. We cannot have perfect foresight, and there are always unknown or unforeseeable factors that can impact our decisions. For instance, when investing in stocks, there is uncertainty about company performance, market trends, and unforeseen events that may affect stock prices. Handling this uncertainty is a key challenge in decision making. Lastly, non-linearity indicates that the relationship between cause and effect is not always straightforward. It is not merely a one-way street where a single decision leads to a predictable outcome. Instead, decisions can have ripple effects, creating feedback loops and interactions that can amplify or dampen the impact of our choices. Just as dropping a pebble in a pond generates ripples that can affect the surrounding water and objects, our decisions can have nonlinear effects on the outcomes we experience. In the context of decision-making, complexity means that there are multiple interconnected factors to consider, making it challenging to fully comprehend all possible consequences. Uncertainty emphasizes the unknowns and unforeseeable elements that can affect our decisions, requiring us to navigate through imperfect information. Non-linearity emphasizes the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of outcomes, reminding us that our decisions can have unexpected and amplified effects. Understanding these concepts helps us approach decision-making with humility and adaptability. We recognize that we may never have all the information we desire, and that outcomes are not always linearly linked to our choices. By embracing complexity, uncertainty, and non-linearity, we can leverage strategies like satisficing, scenario planning, and learning from experience to make better-informed decisions in an ever-evolving and unpredictable world."},{"instruction":"What is change and why is it difficult to forecast change in uncertain, complex and non-linear environment?","output":"Change refers to the process of transformation or alteration in the state, condition, or dynamics of a system or environment. In the context of an uncertain, complex, and non-linear environment, forecasting change becomes challenging due to several reasons: 1. Uncertainty: The presence of uncertainty makes it difficult to accurately predict future events or developments. Uncertainty arises from incomplete information, unpredictable factors, and the involvement of multiple variables that can influence outcomes. In such an environment, precise forecasting becomes challenging as there are always unknowns and unforeseeable elements at play. 2. Complexity: A complex environment involves intricate interconnections and interdependencies among various factors. Decisions and events in one area can have ripple effects and unexpected consequences in other interconnected areas. The numerous variables and their interactions make it difficult to capture the full complexity of the system and accurately forecast how changes will unfold. 3. Non-linearity: Non-linearity implies that cause and effect relationships are not always direct or proportional. Small initial changes can result in disproportionately large impacts, and outcomes can be influenced by feedback loops and interactions within the system. This makes it challenging to predict how a specific change will propagate and the extent of its effects, as the relationship between cause and effect may not follow a linear pattern. Collectively, uncertainty, complexity, and non-linearity create a dynamic and volatile environment where change is challenging to forecast. The interplay of numerous variables, the presence of unknown factors, and the inherent unpredictability of non-linear relationships make it difficult to accurately predict how changes will manifest and what their consequences will be. Therefore, decision-makers must embrace adaptability, flexibility, and strategies that can help navigate and respond to change in real-time, rather than relying solely on forecasting alone."},{"instruction":"Re-phrase: \\"Furthemore, the cause and effect relationships are now always direct or proportional. \\"","output":"Moreover, the relationships between cause and effect are not always straightforward or proportional."},{"instruction":"Is the text logical and coherent: \\"The saying goes that the only certainty in this world is change.

Myrmex hailed for their hospitality, providing food and shelter for weary travelers and wandering adventurers. Queen Jade always ensured that the guest room was well-stocked, offering a glimpse into the hospitality and elegance of the hive. The final chamber, the dining chamber, served as a gathering place for the hive members. Here, they celebrated their victories and shared their bounty. Walls adorned with shimmering gems reflected the soft glow of their bioluminescent bodies, creating an ethereal ambiance. The Myrmex feasted on sweet honeydew, luscious fruits, and gathered resources from their hunting excursions, reinforcing the bonds that held their secluded society together.

The Workers will take care of everything. Worker Sapphire: (Providing support to Sentinel Ruby) We're here for you, Ruby. Just focus on your breathing. Nia: Now, Ruby, let's start with some soothing breaths. In and out, just like that. Sentinel Ruby: (Following Nia's instructions, trying to relax) In and out, in and out. Queen Jade: (Observing the calmness around her) It's truly remarkable, the cycle of life we witness within our hive. Each birth brings new possibilities, new Myrmex to protect our kingdom.

Prepare the room accordingly. (As the labor progresses, the room fills with anticipation and excitement. Nia continues to guide Sentinel Ruby through each stage, ensuring her comfort and safety.)

Sentinel Ruby: (Grateful, amidst the pain) Thank you, Your Majesty, and thank you, Nia. I couldn't have done this without you. Nia: It was my honor to assist you, Ruby. Now, let's bring your little one into this world. (With the combined efforts of Nia, Queen Jade, and the supportive Workers, Sentinel Ruby successfully gives birth to a healthy baby Myrmex.) Queen Jade: (Smiling with pride) Another strong addition to our hive. Well done, Ruby. Sentinel Ruby: (Exhausted yet joyful) Thank you, Queen Jade. I'm forever grateful for your guidance and support. Worker Emerald: (Entering the birthing chamber) Your Highness, the nursery awaits the arrival of the new Myrmex. Queen Jade: Wonderful news! Ruby, take some rest now. We will make sure your little one thrives in our care. Sentinel Ruby: (Relieved) Thank you, Queen Jade. I trust you, and I know my baby will be safe here. Nia: (Taking the baby Myrmex carefully) Don't worry, Ruby. We'll take good care of your precious creation.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"100 word explanation of the structure and function of the heart and blood vessels, the cardiac cycle and pulmonary and systemic circulation.","output":"The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest that acts as a pump to circulate blood throughout the body. It has four chambers - two atria and two ventricles. Blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, form a network that transports blood. During the cardiac cycle, the heart goes through a series of events. The atria contract, forcing blood into the ventricles. Then, the ventricles contract, pumping blood out of the heart. This process is regulated by electrical signals produced by the heart's own pacemaker, the sinoatrial node. Pulmonary circulation is the movement of blood between the heart and lungs. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium, then travels to the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium and then passes to the left ventricle for systemic circulation. Systemic circulation is the movement of oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, which branches into smaller arteries. These arteries transport oxygenated blood to various tissues and organs. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the capillaries, and deoxygenated blood is then carried through veins back to the heart to start the cycle again."},{"instruction":"(In a Jungle Myrmex hive...)

He had always disabled the spellchecker on his phone, thinking he could do just fine without it. So, when he sent me a message saying he had \\"god business\\" booming, I thought he meant to write \\"good business.\\" Little did I know, Jake wasn't referring to any ordinary clientele. Impressed by his entrepreneurial spirit, I replied to Jake, congratulating him on his success. He seemed genuinely excited about his booming god business, but I assumed it was merely a playful exaggeration. However, my perspective changed entirely when Jake invited me to visit his workplace. Curiosity piqued, I found myself standing in front of a nondescript building on a seemingly ordinary street. As I entered, I prepared myself for a surprise, but nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to witness. The moment I stepped into Jake's office, I was met with an incredible sight. Lined up in front of me were some of the most revered deities from various cultures and religions. Osiris, the ancient Egyptian god of the afterlife, was engaged in an animated conversation with Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god of wisdom and good thoughts. Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, was checking his calendar while Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and transitions, offered him some advice. My jaw dropped as Loki, the mischievous Norse god, played pranks on Amaterasu, the radiant Japanese sun goddess. Vishnu, the preserver in Hinduism, was engrossed in an intense discussion with Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent deity of Mesoamerican cultures. Jesus Christ himself was sharing stories with Nyame, the supreme sky deity of the Ashanti people. It was a surreal gathering of mythical and religious figures, brought together by Jake's \\"god business.\\" Each deity had a unique presence about them, emanating power and wisdom. It seemed that Jake had found a way to connect them, acting as a liaison between their divine worlds and the human realm. As I tried to make sense of the astonishing scene before me, Jake approached, wearing a genuine smile. \\"I knew you'd be amazed,\\" he said. \\"The god business is simply about facilitating communication between these amazing beings and helping them collaborate on various projects. They have so much to offer each other and to us.\\" Jake's words washed over me, and I realized the immense opportunity he had discovered. By connecting these transcendent beings, he aimed to tap into their collective knowledge and wisdom, fostering collaboration that could bring about positive change in the world. Feeling fortunate to witness this extraordinary endeavor, I spent hours engrossed in conversations with gods from different pantheons, learning about their unique perspectives. It was an experience that would forever change my perception of the world and the power held within our shared human mythology. And from that day forward, I became a part of Jake's god business, where we strived to bridge the gap between gods and humans, fostering understanding, unity, and a touch of divine magic in our everyday lives."},{"instruction":"(In a Jungle Myrmex hive, which seems to have suddenly appeared in the world of Minecraft…) Worker Sapphire: “Well, business is going on as usual.

He is a detail-oriented and expressive individual who finds solace in playing instruments and creating complex rhythms, Erich has an oval-shaped face with defined cheekbones, almond-shaped hazel eyes, lightly tanned skin, and a relaxed medium-length wavy dark brown hair with natural highlights. He has a smooth and melodic voice, reflecting his passion for music, Erich possesses the power of sonic manipulation, allowing him to manipulate sound waves and create mesmerizing melodies or powerful musical attacks. He also has enhanced auditory perception and is skilled in playing various musical instruments, and Erich’s dark side fully masters his musical abilities, amplifying his artistic energy whenever he desires, Amunet’s Race: Pharaoh, Amunet is a princess who really has no interest in ruling. She has always dreamed of meeting a man, settling down, and living the simple life. Upon meeting she is immediately taken with you and wants to make you hers. She struggles to express her feelings for you along with adjusting to a commoner lifestyle, Orchid’s Race: Alraune, Orchid is a kindhearted plant girl who is different from the rest of her kind. Unlikely others of her spices she wants to one mate who wants to be with her for her and not because of her scent. She also does not feed on men’s spirit energy. She fell head over roots for you and unlike Amunet she has no problem expressing her feelings for you she flirts with you all the time. She spends most of her in the greenhouse/garden connected to your house, but she can move around thanks to a specialized wheelchair/pot, Maya’s Race: Kraken, Maya is the type of girl who loves to cuddle. She likes to grab you with her tentacles from across the room and hold you. As you can guess she is in love with you. She, like Orchid, is very flirty and likes to show it in front of the other girls. She likes it when you come to her room and swim with her because that means she can have you all to herself, Lily’s Race: Honeybee, Lily is a shy and kind girl. She and Orchid are best friends because of their species interactions. Lily, like many of the girls, has feelings for you, but because Lily is shy when the other girls are around she kind disappears. She enjoys the moments that she can get alone with Erich but doesn’t mind sharing him with Orchid because they are best friends, Juno’s Race: Kikimora, Juno comes from a species that lives to serve their masters. After your accidental encounter with her she chooses you as her master. She lives to be your maid and right-hand woman. Even though there are other people in the house she only really cares about helping you in any way imaginable, Aurora’s Race: Unicorn, Aurora is a unicorn and because of that her love for you comes in the purest form. She knows that you have other girls in your life and tries to control her jealousy. She doesn’t like sharing you with the other girls, but will share with Luna. She is beautiful and very elegant in the day to day, Venus’s Race: Flow Kelp, Venus is similar to Orchid in the way that she is a stationary monster girl. Unlike Orchid she can’t move freely because she needs the water. With that said she can move around the pool. Much like Maya she loves to wrap you up and hold you close, Luna’s Race: White Horn, Luna is very passionate especially when it comes to you, however, she always tries to remain calm. She is strong and often helps you with your work around the farm. She lives in the barn with Aurora and thus they become good friends.

With all that said she would never hurt anyone she cares for without reason of course. She is very playful in a sexual sense and lets just say her toxin will have affects that will come in very useful on full moons. While she might seem a little rough around the edges she does care, but beside Erich the only one she truly respects as her greater is Amunet because they originate from the same region and Girtablilu would often carry out special assignments for the Pharaohs, Savannah’s Race: Banshee, Many people would be wary of Savannah’s presence because it is believed they are omens of death; it is not always the case. For the ones she loves she would never want them to experience pain of any kind. She is very beautiful in her black robes which cover her milky white skin. She gets along very well with everyone, but she is very close with Juno, maybe because both of them have an undying bond with Erich, Rosie’s Race: Hellhound, Often having an intimidating presence many people fear the hellhound as they believe if not for the laws forbidding it they would kill and eat humans just for the fun of it before dragging their spirits off to hell. In the case of Rosie however, it couldn’t be further from the truth. Around Erich she is like a sweet adorable puppy that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t rip the heads off anyone that tried to take Erich away from her, Rhea’s Race: Manticore, A devourer of men sorta speak while all the girls get strong sexual urges when it comes to their mate Rhea is on par with Talia.

Ваш сервер состоит из n процессоров. Но так как процессоры разные, то и достигают они одинаковой скорости работы при разном энергопотреблении. А именно, i -й процессор в нагрузке тратит ai энергии за одну секунду. Вашему серверу в качестве тестовой нагрузки придет m задач. Про каждую задачу вам известны два значения: tj и lj — момент времени, когда задача j придет и время выполнения задачи в секундах. Для начала вы решили реализовать простейший планировщик, ведущий себя следующим образом: в момент tj прихода задачи, вы выбираете свободный процессор с минимальным энергопотреблением и выполняете данную задачу на выбранном процессоре все заданное время. Если к моменту прихода задачи свободных процессоров нет, то вы просто отбрасываете задачу. Процессор, на котором запущена задача j будет занят ровно lj секунд, то есть освободится ровно в момент tj+lj и в этот же момент уже может быть назначен для выполнения какой-то другой задачи.

Куча будет упорядочена по энергопотреблению, то есть процессор с наименьшим энергопотреблением будет всегда доступен на вершине кучи. Алгоритм решения будет следующим: 1. Создаем пустую минимальную кучу \`processors\` для хранения процессоров. 2. Инициализируем суммарное энергопотребление \`energy_consumption\` равным 0. 3. Сортируем задачи по моменту времени их прихода. 4. Для каждой задачи: - Если \`processors\` не пустая куча (есть свободные процессоры): - Извлекаем процессор с наименьшим энергопотреблением (\`min_processor\`) из \`processors\`. - Добавляем энергопотребление этого процессора умноженное на длительность задачи к \`energy_consumption\`. - Добавляем в \`processors\` процессор с энергопотреблением \`min_processor + ai\` и временем освобождения \`tj + lj\`. - Если \`processors\` пустая куча (все процессоры заняты): - Отбрасываем задачу. 5.

Queen Jade: Yes, that is crucial. We must understand their habits, weaknesses, and strengths. Sentinel, you shall lead the scouting mission. Take a few Soldiers and report back to me as soon as you have valuable information. Sentinel: Understood, Queen Jade. We shall leave immediately.

However, some commonly mentioned languages that are considered relatively easier for Chinese speakers to learn include: 1. Japanese: Similar to Chinese, Japanese uses Chinese characters (Kanji) alongside two phonetic scripts (Hiragana and Katakana). There are also some similarities in grammar and sentence structure. 2. Korean: Korean has a phonetic alphabet (Hangul) that is relatively easy to learn. There are also some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with Chinese. 3. Indonesian/Malay: Both Indonesian and Malay languages use the Latin alphabet and have simple phonetic rules. They also have straightforward grammar structures and relatively fewer characters compared to Chinese. 4. Thai: Although Thai uses a unique script, it does not rely on Chinese characters.

Finally, the Queen is the largest of the Myrmex castes, and bears a resemblance to the Worker, but with a pair of horns on top of her head, and with a long, pulsating, sac-like abdomen. One notable queen is Queen Jade - who rules a hive where all the Myrmex there are named after gemstones. Her throne room leads to the birthing chamber, where a Myrmex mother is taken by workers when labor begins. However, while bringing food to the resting chamber, Queen Jade notices her best soldier - Garnet - has gone into labor with her quadruplets, and two of the workers are struggling to lift her up due to the weight of the quadruplets. But how did Garnet go into labor at just seven months pregnant?)","output":"Queen Jade: (rushing into the resting chamber) What is the commotion here? Why can't you lift Garnet? Worker 1: Your Majesty, Garnet has gone into labor. But she's only seven months pregnant! We weren't prepared for this. Worker 2: She insisted on joining the mission to gather food for the hive. It seems the strain was too much for her. Queen Jade: (concerned) Seven months? That's far too early for labor. We must get her to the birthing chamber immediately. Worker 1: We've been trying, Your Majesty, but we can't seem to lift her. The weight of the quadruplets is too much for just two workers. Queen Jade: (resolute) Garnet is our best soldier. We cannot leave her here. Gather more workers, I'll assist in carrying her. (The Queen and the workers quickly return to the resting chamber with a larger group of workers. Together, they carefully lift Garnet and begin their slow journey towards the birthing chamber.) Garnet: (breathing heavily) Thank you, Your Majesty. I... I didn't expect... this. Queen Jade: (stroking Garnet's head with a gentle touch) You should have informed me earlier, Garnet. We would have made arrangements to ensure your well-being. Garnet: (grimacing in pain) I... didn't want to be a burden, Your Majesty. I thought I could handle it. But now... it's too much. Queen Jade: (softly) You are never a burden to the hive, Garnet. We are a team, and we support each other. Your health and the health of your young are of utmost importance. (They finally reach the birthing chamber, where the Myrmex mother lies in waiting. The workers carefully lay Garnet beside her.) Myrmex Mother: (gently) Garnet, my sister, you've arrived. Let me help ease your pain. Garnet: (gratefully) Thank you, sister. I'm sorry for putting you through this. It wasn't my intention. Queen Jade: (reassuringly) We are a family here, Garnet. We will ensure your safety and the safety of your young. Rest and let the Mother take care of you now. (As Garnet's labor continues, the Queen and the workers stand guard outside the birthing chamber, ready to assist if needed. Together, they demonstrate the strength of unity and support within the Myrmex hive.)"},{"instruction":"Describe encounter named \\"Obscure Discovery of Witherium\\": In the night, they discovered artificial mineral named witherium, appearance is Vantablack, almost they don’t know witherium, origin is witherium is not created by humans but created by Witherians.

This artificial mineral possessed an appearance as dark as the void itself, similar to the infamous Vantablack. Intriguingly, none among them had ever heard of witherium, and little did they know, its origins were far more enigmatic than they could fathom. Unbeknownst to human knowledge, witherium was not a creation of mankind, but rather, it was forged by a civilization known as the Witherians. These ancient beings had mastered the art of manipulating reality, and witherium was their extraordinary creation. Its purpose, as discovered soon after, was to induce a state of desolation and decay upon anything it touched, leaving behind a trail of darkness and ashen ruins. As the night progressed, the explorers delved deeper into their obscure discovery. Fascinated by the withering potential of this mineral, they further scrutinized its effects on various objects. With each experiment, they witnessed the transformative power of witherium, as the once vibrant and solid materials succumbed to a state of blackened deterioration. But the anomaly did not end there. During another fateful night of their exploration, the adventurers encountered a peculiar phenomenon. A shadow-like entity, reminiscent of the withered materials, seemingly materialized before their very eyes. This enigmatic presence emitted an eerie aura, coupled with an array of haunting memories. Bewildered and astounded, the explorers managed to capture the entity on camera, immortalizing its existence. Equipped with undeniable evidence, the explorers promptly shared the video with the world, eager to shed light on their unearthly encounter. However, their intentions were met with skepticism and disbelief. The mainstream society dismissed the bizarre footage as nothing more than a controversial and elaborate hoax. The notion of Witherians, beings from a realm unknown to humanity, was regarded as sheer fantasy by a skeptical world. Undeterred by the prevailing doubt, the explorers clung onto their conviction. They strived to uncover the truth behind the encounter, relentlessly seeking validation for their experience. A hidden truth, begging to be acknowledged, lingered just beyond the veil of skepticism. The obscure discovery of witherium and the subsequent encounter with the shadow-like Witherians presented an enthralling enigma that challenged the limits of human understanding. Amidst the skepticism and controversy, lies the potential for a new chapter in humanity's perception of reality, waiting to be explored with an open mind and an unwavering curiosity."},{"instruction":"Describe Witherians, most horror species from Horribleworld Witheria, cruel and sad that tormenting and torturing humanity to heartbreaking brink of extinction.","output":"In the dark depths of the Horribleworld Witheria exists a species known as the Witherians, a nightmarish and malevolent entity that elicits sheer terror in the hearts of humanity.

What could the League of Nations do that the United Nations can not? What can the United Nations do that the League of Nations could not?","output":"The League of Nations was an international organization established after World War I, with the goal of promoting peace and preventing future conflicts. However, it had limited power and effectiveness compared to the United Nations (UN) which succeeded it. 1. Power and limitations of the League of Nations: a. The League had limited power to enforce its decisions: The League's ability to resolve conflicts relied on diplomacy and collective security rather than military force. It did not possess an independent military force and relied on individual nations to provide military support. b. Absence of major powers: Some major world powers, including the United States, did not join the League, limiting its global influence. The absence of key players weakened its effectiveness. c. Lack of universal membership and representation: Many important nations, especially in Asia and Africa, were not members of the League, restricting its ability to address global challenges comprehensively. d. Soft power tools: The League had limited tools like economic sanctions, arbitration, and moral pressure to address conflicts and promote disarmament and global cooperation. 2. Unique roles of the United Nations over the League of Nations: a. Enforceable decisions: Unlike the League, the UN has the ability to make enforceable decisions through its United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which has the power to issue binding resolutions and authorize the use of military force if necessary. b. Universal membership: The UN has near-universal membership, which enables representation and participation from nearly all recognized states, giving it a more comprehensive global reach. c. Peacekeeping missions: The UN has the authority to deploy peacekeeping missions to troubled regions and conflicts worldwide, facilitating conflict resolution and fostering stability. d. Specialized agencies and programs: The UN has numerous specialized agencies and programs dedicated to various issues such as human rights (UN Human Rights Council), health (World Health Organization), and education (UNESCO), which enhance its ability to address diverse global challenges. e. Permanent members with veto power: The UNSC includes five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), each having a veto power. This gives them significant influence in making decisions and addressing global crises. In summary, while the League of Nations had limited power to enforce its decisions and lacked the comprehensive global membership and representation, the United Nations has a wider range of tools, enforceable decision-making mechanisms, peacekeeping capabilities, and specialized agencies, which enhance its ability to address global challenges more effectively than its predecessor."},{"instruction":"L'hyportèse sur l'étude et le déploiement d'une application mobile pour la gestion scolaire. référence","output":"Il n'y a pas de référence précise sur l'hypothèse concernant l'étude et le déploiement d'une application mobile pour la gestion scolaire car cela dépendra de l'expertise et des besoins spécifiques de chaque établissement scolaire.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Mexican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). * When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her sister, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the sister has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The sister was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The sister, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the sister fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the sister - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing sister intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned sister attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the sister's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing sister to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the sister's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting sister inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed sister is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the sister is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The sister is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the sister's pressing grip while exerting. The sister asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The sister attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the sister about an impending stench. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the sister is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the sister what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the sister asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The sister then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the sister to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing sister relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing sister. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the sister, the astonished sister taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished sister continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the sister with a playful sulk that what happened is the sister's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully. * The sister playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the sister, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the sister delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly acknowledges the sister's observation of her rear end, describing the feeling of her pants being full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The sister mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman acknowledges the sister's mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the sister's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door and pressure that the sister applied on the returning woman's stomach. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her sister while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing sister waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Comedy of Errors\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: An apartment building in a bustling city, decorated with vibrant Mexican artwork. Characters: - Carmen Rodriguez: A vibrant Mexican-American woman in her late twenties. She has long, curly black hair, olive skin, and a curvy figure. Dressed in a colorful, flowy bohemian blouse and patterned pants, Carmen embodies a free-spirited character. - Rosa Rodriguez: Carmen's younger sister, early thirties. She has a petite frame, shoulder-length brown hair, fair skin, and a mischievous twinkle in her eye. Rosa always looks put-together, wearing a semi-formal blouse and tailored pants. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The colorful artwork on the walls reflects Carmen's Mexican heritage. She approaches her apartment, visibly uncomfortable, trying to hold her stomach. CARMEN grips her stomach tightly and looks down at her outfit with a mixture of embarrassment and desperation. CARMEN (groaning) Oh no, no, no! This can't be happening right now! She tries her pockets, searching frantically for her keys, only to realize they're missing. Carmen dials Rosa's number, pacing nervously. CARMEN (into the phone) Rosa, where are you? I need to get in! Rosa's phone rings nearby, abandoned on the living room couch. Carmen knocks on the apartment door, growing more frantic with each knock. CARMEN (yelling) Rosa! Please, I can't hold it any longer! Finally, Rosa stirs from her nap, bewildered by the noise. She groggily walks toward the door. ROSA (rubbing her eyes) What's all the noise about? Carmen? Carmen's eyes widen, a look of horror crossing her face. CARMEN (under her breath) No, not her! Rosa fumbles with the keys, struggling to unlock the door. Carmen jumps nervously from foot to foot, unable to wait any longer. CARMEN (whispering intensely) Rosa, open the door! Hurry! Rosa finally unlocks and opens the door, but Carmen doesn't wait for an invitation. She tries to barge in, but Rosa stops her. ROSA (concerned) Wait, Carmen! What's going on? Why are you so...desperate? Carmen struggles against Rosa's grip, her face turning red with both effort and humiliation. CARMEN (strained) Rosa, please, I can't explain now. Just move! Desperate to get inside, Carmen pushes past Rosa, but Rosa's reflexes cause her to squeeze Carmen's stomach harder than intended. Carmen's face contorts with an expression of simultaneous shock and relief. CARMEN (abruptly) Oh no... Rosa is taken aback by Carmen's reaction, her concern growing. ROSA (confused) What's wrong, Carmen? Why are you making that face? Carmen can only respond with strained grunts and hushed, cryptic replies between groans. CARMEN (strained) It's happening...you'll see... Suddenly, an unmistakable odor permeates the air, creeping into Rosa's nose. ROSA (disgusted) Oh my gosh! Is that...?! Her question remains unfinished as Rosa realizes what has transpired. Carmen continues to defecate in her pants, letting out a sigh of relief. Rosa can barely contain her laughter, but Carmen tries to deflect. CARMEN (embarrassed) Rosa, please! Let me in, I need to clean up! Rosa, still chuckling, moves aside and gestures for Carmen to enter. ROSA (mockingly) Of course, my dear sister. You better hurry, though. You wouldn't want to stay like that for too long. As Carmen enters the apartment, Rosa can't help but comment on her waddling. ROSA (teasing) Look at you, waddling with your pants filled like a little kid. How adorable! At first, Carmen is indignant, but soon she embraces the playful banter. CARMEN (teasing) Hey, it's your fault! If you hadn't taken so long, this wouldn't have happened. Rosa denies the accusation in a playful tone, mocking Carmen's evident enjoyment during the accident. ROSA (mocking) Oh, so you're blaming me for your little pleasure moment? How fascinating! Carmen, still pinching her nose, coyly acknowledges her state of affairs. CARMEN (playfully) Well, I must admit, it does feel kind of good... But I really need to clean up! Rosa, cringing as she takes in the odor, agrees mockingly. ROSA (teasing) Yes, you stink quite impressively, dear sister. Bathroom's that way, hurry up! Carmen mischievously fans the odor toward Rosa, pinching her own nose for dramatic effect. CARMEN (grinning) I won't forget this! Now, if you'll excuse me... Rosa waves Carmen off, still cackling and visibly reacting to the stench. ROSA (laughing) Oh, I won't forget it either! Get yourself cleaned up, you filthy thing! Carmen hurriedly waddles toward the bathroom, leaving Rosa doubled over with laughter. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"ПРивет","output":"Привет!

APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY A vibrant African-American woman in her early thirties, LISA, rushes down the hallway of her apartment building. She is wearing stylish black pants and a colorful patterned blouse. Her hair is done in braids, bouncing slightly with each hurried step. A look of desperation is etched across her face. She stops abruptly in front of her apartment door, realization crossing her features. LISA (distraught) Oh no... I can't believe it... Lisa fumbles in her purse, panic rising. She pulls out an empty water bottle, an apple, and a small packet of fiber supplements. LISA (CONT'D) (muttering) I knew I shouldn't have taken so much fiber. Her eyes widen as she stares at the door, her hand clutching the doorknob. She can feel the urgent pressure building inside her. LISA (CONT'D) (frantically) Come on, Liz! Pick up, pick up! Lisa rapidly dials her flatmate's number, anxiety radiating off of her. She anxiously paces back and forth as the phone rings, but Liz, her flatmate, doesn't answer. LISA (CONT'D) (gritting her teeth) Where are you, Liz? Panicking, Lisa ducks into the corner as she fumbles with her phone. She sends Liz a series of text messages, praying for a response. She glances back at the door, desperate to find a solution to her predicament. LISA (CONT'D) (calling out) Liz! Liz, are you in there? Please, answer! Lisa pounds on the door, her desperation growing with each knock. LISA (CONT'D) (calling out) Liz! Let me in, please! Just as Lisa is about to explode, she hears a muffled voice from the other side of the door. VOICE (O.S.) (faintly) What's going on? Lisa's eyes go wide as she recognizes the voice. It's her sister, NATALIE. Panic grips her heart as she realizes the situation she's now found herself in. LISA (under her breath) Not Natalie, please not now... Natalie slowly opens the door, rubbing her eyes sleepily. She is also African-American, with a slightly taller and fuller build than Lisa. Her hair is in a messy bun, and she wears cozy pajamas. NATALIE (yawning) Lisa, what's the commotion about? Lisa rushes forward, gripping Natalie's shoulders. LISA (urgent) Natalie, I need to get in! Now! Natalie blinks in confusion, slightly disoriented from her nap. NATALIE (sleepily) Why? What's the rush? Lisa's eyes dart back and forth, and she finally blurts out the truth. LISA (embarrassed) I... I need to use the bathroom. Really badly. Natalie's eyes widen in realization. NATALIE (teasingly) Oh, sis. You've gotten yourself into quite the shitty situation, huh? Lisa groans, a mixture of frustration and embarrassment. LISA (sarcastically) Ha, ha. Very funny. Natalie steps aside, finally understanding Lisa's urgency. NATALIE (laughing) Alright, go on in. I won't stop you from emptying the tank. Lisa quickly moves forward, attempting to bypass Natalie. But Natalie playfully grabs her arm, a mischievous glint in her eye. NATALIE (CONT'D) (teasingly) Hold on a sec, sis. Let me see what you're carrying in those pants. Lisa freezes, a look of horror on her face. LISA (exasperated) No, Nat, please! Natalie can't contain her laughter, releasing Lisa from her grip. NATALIE (teasing) Oh, come on. I need to witness this legendary accident. Lisa reluctantly turns around, revealing the awful consequences of her predicament. Her pants sag slightly, and an overwhelming stench wafts in the air. Natalie's eyes widen, a mix of disbelief and amusement. NATALIE (CONT'D) (mockingly) Wow, little sis. Never thought I'd see you walking around like a big, stinky baby. Lisa's embarrassment quickly turns into playfulness. LISA (pouting) Hey, it's not my fault! You were the one who took forever to open the door. Natalie rolls her eyes, teasingly waving Lisa off. NATALIE (laughing) Oh, sure. Blame everything on me. Now, hurry up and go clean yourself. You're turning this place into a biohazard zone. Lisa playfully pinches her nose, waddling her way into the apartment. LISA (grinning) You're just jealous that I can fill a room with my special fragrance. Natalie scrunches up her face, playfully gagging. NATALIE (teasing) Just go already! Trust me, no air freshener can save you now. Lisa giggles as she finally heads towards the bathroom, leaving Natalie in the hallway. INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER Lisa closes the bathroom door behind her, relieved to finally have some privacy. The camera pans to Natalie in the hallway, still chuckling to herself. NATALIE (laughing) She's never gonna live this down. The comedic duo, Lisa and Natalie, showcase their unique relationship in the face of even the most ridiculous situations. Their banter, although playful, highlights their genuine love and understanding for each other.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). * When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her sister, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the sister has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The sister was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The sister, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the sister fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the sister - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing sister intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned sister attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the sister's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing sister to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the sister's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting sister inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed sister is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the sister is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The sister is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the sister's pressing grip while exerting. The sister asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The sister attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the sister about an impending stench. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the sister is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the sister what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the sister asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The sister then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the sister to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing sister relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing sister. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the sister, the astonished sister taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished sister continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the sister with a playful sulk that what happened is the sister's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully. * The sister playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the sister, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the sister delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly acknowledges the sister's observation of her rear end, describing the feeling of her pants being full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The sister mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman acknowledges the sister's mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the sister's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door and pressure that the sister applied on the returning woman's stomach. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her sister while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing sister waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: The Poop Encounter Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: The scene takes place in a cozy urban apartment with a narrow hallway leading up to the front door. The interior is brightly colored with various art pieces adorning the walls. The apartment has a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Characters: 1. Maya Johnson (African-American woman, mid-30s) - Maya is the returning woman. She has shoulder-length curly hair, a warm smile, and vibrant brown eyes. Maya is fashionably dressed in a loose-fitting jumpsuit. 2. Lisa Johnson (African-American woman, late 20s) - Lisa is Maya's sister and has been staying in the flat recently. She is petite, with short, straight hair, and wears a casual but chic outfit. --- INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Maya approaches her apartment door, an expression of desperation on her face. Her footsteps are frantic, clenching her stomach in discomfort. MAYA (whispering to herself) Oh, please, please let me find my key! She pats herself down, searching for her misplaced house key, but it's nowhere to be found. She takes out her phone and dials her flatmate's number. No response. MAYA (desperation rising) Come on, Lisa! Answer your phone! Maya begins knocking on the door, desperation etched in her every movement. Suddenly, a voice is heard from inside the apartment. LISA (O.S.) (disturbed) What's happening out there? Maya's eyes widen as she realizes her sister was inside the whole time. She starts frantically knocking and calling out. MAYA Lisa, open the door! Please! LISA (O.S.) (sleepy and slow) Coming, coming... Hold on. Maya's urgency grows as she fidgets with each passing second. Finally, the door creaks open, revealing Lisa standing there, groggy and puzzled. LISA (mumbling) Maya? What's going on? Why the rush? Maya tries to brush past Lisa but is intercepted, Lisa's grip tight on her arm. MAYA (nervously) Lisa, please, it's urgent. Just move! LISA (concerned) Whoa, slow down! What's wrong with you? Maya attempts to free herself from Lisa's grip but struggles, becoming increasingly desperate. MAYA (agitated) Lisa, I need to get in! Step aside! Lisa tenses up, applying pressure unknowingly to Maya's stomach. Suddenly, it happens. Maya's face contorts in shock as she poops her pants, a horrified expression replacing her urgency. Maya groans in relief as her body involuntarily relieves itself. Lisa's confusion deepens. LISA (disbelief) Maya, what is— Wait, is that— Lisa's nose crinkles as the foul odor hits her senses. Realization dawns on her, and she bursts into laughter. MAYA (hushed) Lisa, stop! Let me in! With a sheepish look, Maya avoids directly addressing the situation. She inches past Lisa, attempting to enter the flat. Lisa stops her, grabbing Maya's arm once more. LISA (teasingly) Oh no, we can't have you walking around with a load in your pants now, can we? Maya pouts, a mix of embarrassment and playfulness. MAYA (mock-angry) This all happened because of your blocking and pressing! Lisa playfully denies any involvement, prodding Maya for her unusual response. LISA (teasing) C'mon, Maya. I didn't think that would lead to this delightful episode! Maya, growing more at ease, attempts to head to the bathroom to clean up. MAYA (resigned) Alright, fine. I need to clean up. Let me pass! Before Maya can leave, Lisa intercepts her and gently turns her around to observe her stained pants. LISA (mockingly) Look at you, little miss messy pants! Maya coyly acknowledges her predicament, playfully feeling the bulge in her pants. MAYA (pouting) Oh yes, my precious mess... I really need to clean up. Lisa recoils from the odor playfully, agreeing that Maya should clean up. LISA (teasingly) Definitely, you stink! Go get yourself cleaned, smelly bum! Maya grins mischievously, pinching her nose and playfully fanning the air towards Lisa. MAYA (teasing) But who made me like this? You, little stinker! Lisa cringes, cackling, and waves Maya off to the bathroom. LISA (laughing) Please, go! The stench is unbearable! Maya, still chuckling, gingerly waddles into the apartment, acknowledging her sister's jest. MAYA (grinning) Just wait till you need my help someday, Lisa! Lisa continues laughing as Maya disappears into the bathroom, leaving behind a trail of laughter and an unforgettable incident. --- Note: The above scene is written according to the given prompt.

After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the sister delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly acknowledges the sister's observation of her rear end, describing the feeling of her pants being full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The sister mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman acknowledges the sister's mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the sister's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door and pressure that the sister applied on the returning woman's stomach. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her sister while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing sister waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY A bustling city street serves as the backdrop. People hurriedly walk past as we focus on the COMMOTION of a MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, MARIA (30s), desperately clutching her abdomen. She is stylishly dressed in high-waisted trousers, a flowy blouse, and colorful accessories. MARIA (to herself) Oh no, no, no! This can't be happening. Maria increases her pace, anxiously making her way through the bustling crowd. She races towards her apartment building, determination etched on her face. CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Maria reaches her floor and stumbles forward, immediately facing her apartment door. Panic washes over her face as she rummages through her bag, desperately searching for her lost keys. MARIA (sighs) Where are they? Come on! Maria pulls out her phone and frantically dials her flatmate's number. She anxiously waits, but there's no answer. MARIA (calls out) Elena! Elena, are you in there? Silence. Panic sets in. MARIA (knocking on door) Elena, please, I need to get in! Maria's desperation reaches its peak as she jumps up and down while knocking on the door. Her face turns red, perspiration trickling down her brow. MARIA (barely audible) I can't... hold it... anymore. Just as it seems she can no longer bear it, a voice comes from the other side of the door, unsuspected. VOICE (O.S.) Hey, what's going on out there? Maria freezes, her eyes widening as she realizes the familiar voice belongs to her SISTER, ROSA (late 20s). Maria was hoping to avoid her in this predicament. MARIA (whispered) No, not Rosa! Maria quickly composes herself as she tries to sound composed, putting on a brave face. MARIA Oh, Rosa! I thought you were still asleep. Slowly, Rosa unlocks the door. She opens it slightly, her expression weary from her nap. ROSA (yawning) What's going on? Do you know what time it is? MARIA (frustrated) Rosa, just move out of my way! Maria tries to barge in, but Rosa intercepts her, grabbing onto her arm with concern. ROSA Where's the fire? What's the matter? Maria struggles to free herself, her face contorting with urgency. MARIA Please, Rosa, just let me in! ROSA (confused) But why? What's happening? Maria's face finally reveals the truth as Rosa inadvertently applies pressure to her stomach. Maria's eyes widen, and she groans abruptly, the shock of the moment causing her to lose control. Maria's face becomes a mix of relief and embarrassment as she poops her pants in slow motion. The camera uses subtle yet exaggerated sound effects to portray the process. ROSA (baffled) What the...? Maria, are you okay? Maria tries to reply, but her strained voice is barely audible, revealing her relief and hinting at her embarrassing situation. She then releases soft grunts, almost sounding pleasurable. Rosa's confusion deepens. ROSA (strained) Maria, seriously, what's wrong? Maria manages to strain a reply between grunts, ominously warning Rosa about the impending stench. MARIA (gasping) You... better... step back... smelly... As the stench reaches Rosa, her face contorts in disgust. The reality of the situation dawns on her. ROSA (disgusted) Oh, my god! Did you just...? Maria's embarrassment takes over, and she looks down sheepishly, avoiding her sister's gaze. MARIA (whispered) Just... let me... in. Rosa bursts into laughter, unable to contain herself anymore. ROSA (laughing) I can't believe you pooped your pants like a little kid! Maria, initially indignant, starts to embrace the absurdity, playfully responding. MARIA (teasing) Yeah, well, if you hadn't blocked my path and squeezed my stomach... Rosa playfully denies Maria's accusation, mocking her in return. ROSA (teasing) Oh, sure, blame me for your little accident. Grow up, Maria! Maria's indignation slowly fades, and a smile begins to spread across her face. MARIA (laughing) You're right, I need to clean up. Let me through! Rosa reluctantly steps aside, gesturing for Maria to enter the apartment. ROSA (teasing) Go on... Stinky! As Maria gingerly waddles into the apartment, Rosa continues to mock her for her waddle and the state of her pants. ROSA (laughing) Don't forget to wash those poop-filled pants, potty pants! Maria playfully sulk her response. MARIA (teasingly) You owe me some new pants after this! Rosa mockingly agrees, gesturing to the smell emanating from Maria. ROSA (teasing) Yes, you really need to go and clean up, you stinky girl! Maria playfully fans the odor from her bum towards her sister, pinching her own nose. MARIA (grinning mischievously) Well, you're the one who made me do this! Rosa, still cackling and cringing, waves Maria off to the bathroom to clean herself up. ROSA (laughing) Enough! Just go clean up that mess, smelly pants! Maria heads towards the bathroom, smiling at her sister's teasing. CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM - DAY Maria shuts the bathroom door behind her, laughing to herself. The absurdity of the situation sinks in, and she finally lets go, her laughter echoing through the apartment."},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet, Sonic, SpongeBob and Dragon ball characters react to Goku Black: (Goku Black were Black) Well, well, well. it’s been a long time, Patrick.

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). * When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her sister, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the sister has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The sister was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The sister, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the sister fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the sister - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing sister intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned sister attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the sister's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing sister to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the sister's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting sister inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed sister is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the sister is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The sister is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the sister's pressing grip while exerting. The sister asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The sister attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the sister about an impending stench. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the sister is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the sister what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the sister asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The sister then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the sister to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing sister relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing sister. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the sister, the astonished sister taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished sister continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the sister with a playful sulk that what happened is the sister's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully. * The sister playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so.

The government of Horribleworld Earth is authoritarian and oppressive. Individual freedoms are severely restricted, and dissent is brutally suppressed. Censorship and surveillance are pervasive, with citizens living in constant fear of punishment for speaking out against the regime. The justice system is corrupt, benefiting only the powerful and punishing the weak. Violence is a common occurrence in Horribleworld Earth.

The digital revolution accelerates, internet usage becomes widespread, and communication barriers are broken down. Globalization intensifies, as trade liberalization and cross-border investments reach new heights. 2010 - The world faces increasing challenges related to climate change and environmental degradation. The effects of global warming become apparent, with rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of biodiversity. Efforts to address these issues through international agreements like the Paris Agreement begin to gain momentum, but progress is slow. 2020 - The world is hit by a series of unprecedented events. The COVID-19 pandemic spreads rapidly, leaving a devastating toll on human lives and economies. Governments struggle to respond effectively, leading to social and political unrest. Inequality deepens as the pandemic exacerbates existing disparities in healthcare, education, and access to resources. 2030 - The Earth is transformed into Horribleworld. The cumulative effects of years of neglect and mismanagement come to fruition. The environment is in disarray, with air and water pollution reaching alarming levels. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires are more frequent and severe. The planet's resources are depleted, leading to scarcity and conflicts over basic necessities. The global economy collapses under the weight of widespread corruption, financial crises, and a lack of regulatory oversight. The gap between the rich and the poor widens exponentially, leading to social unrest, riots, and civil conflicts. Governments become more authoritarian in an attempt to maintain control, further suppressing dissent and basic human rights. Education and healthcare systems crumble under the weight of strained resources and lack of funding. Access to quality education becomes a privilege of the wealthy, widening the already existing social divide.

The fear of punishment and retribution keeps the population in a state of submission and compliance. Socioeconomic inequality is magnified in Orwellworld Earth, with a stark divide between the ruling elite and the impoverished masses. The government maintains a strict hierarchy, with the privileged few enjoying lavish lifestyles and unimaginable wealth, while the majority struggle to survive in squalor and deprivation. Basic necessities such as food, healthcare, and education are intentionally withheld from the lower classes as a means of control and manipulation. The environment in Orwellworld Earth is neglected and degraded. Pollution runs rampant, as industrial activities are prioritized over the well-being of the planet. Natural resources are exploited without regard for sustainability or conservation. The air is thick with smog, water sources are polluted, and wildlife and ecosystems are decimated. The consequences of this ecologically destructive mindset exacerbate the suffering and despair of the population. In Orwellworld Earth, the human spirit is systematically crushed, and individuality is erased. Fear and oppression permeate every aspect of life, stifling creativity, diversity, and personal fulfillment. It is a world where the worst aspects of authoritarianism and manipulation are fully realized, reminding us of the importance of safeguarding our freedoms and fighting against such dystopian realities."},{"instruction":"Describe opposite of Orwellworld Earth.","output":"The opposite of Orwellworld Earth can be envisioned as Freedomworld Earth, a utopian version of our planet where individual liberties, equality, and democracy flourish.

It involves assigning labels or tags to information assets to identify their security requirements and determine appropriate handling and protection measures. The purpose of information asset classification is to: 1. Identify and understand the value and importance of information assets to the organization. 2. Establish a framework for prioritizing security controls and allocating resources effectively. 3. Develop appropriate access control and data protection measures based on risk levels. 4. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and legal requirements. 5. Facilitate incident response and recovery by clearly prioritizing critical information assets. The classification process typically involves the following steps: 1. Inventory: Identify and document all information assets within the organization, including electronic files, databases, physical documents, and intellectual property. 2. Assessment: Evaluate the value, sensitivity, criticality, and potential risks associated with each information asset. Consider factors such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, legal requirements, and potential impact on the organization if compromised. 3. Classification Levels: Establish a classification scheme or framework that defines different levels or categories for information assets based on their assessed risk levels. Common classification levels include public, internal, confidential, and restricted. 4. Labeling: Apply appropriate labels, tags, or markings to each information asset based on its classification level. This helps ensure that the asset is handled, stored, transmitted, and accessed in accordance with its specific security requirements. 5. Access Control: Implement access control mechanisms, such as user authentication, authorization, and encryption, to protect information assets based on their classification levels. Higher classified assets should have stricter access control measures in place. 6. Ongoing Review: Regularly review and update the classification of information assets as their value, sensitivity, and risk levels may change over time. This ensures that security controls and protection measures remain relevant and effective. By effectively classifying information assets, organizations can focus their security efforts and resources on protecting their most critical and sensitive data while achieving regulatory compliance and minimizing potential risks."},{"instruction":"Can you summarize this article from the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Project? \\"Denebola Incident An exploration management AI from TakiCorb went renegade and began to build its own empire using replicating nanites in the Denebola system. Somewhere the programming complexity became too large and the AI broke down; the system is still inhabited by a vital and weird nanotech ecology. An exploration management AI from TakiCorb went renegade (possibly through sabotage) in 1990 and began to build its own empire using replicating nanites in the Denebola system. It entered the Oort cloud around the star, setting up a number of stealth bases before moving inwards. The Virginis Combine amat farms were infiltrated and attacked by nanoweaponry, and after their spectacular destruction the whole system was quickly and completely subjugated by the ambitious AI. Only a desperate radio transmission warned the rest of the Combine about the threat. The next Combine expedition were met with a powerful and deadly nano-attack, but could report that a vast number of autofacs were active in the system, converting it into some form of Dyson sphere. The Virginis Combine estimated that the rogue AI posed a grave threat to all systems in the vicinity, and assembled the largest unified fleet at the time to deal with it. The Battle of Denebola went badly, despite the preparations, advanced khaki goo and hyperlaser weaponry. The system was by now filled with a huge nanosphere with hyperturing capabilities, far too extensive to be infiltrated or purged with the small amounts of nano the fleet brought with it. The survivors retreated, losing several ships to nanoinfections during the trip. The Combine hunkered down in preparation for the onslaught from Denebola, developing replicator weaponry together with the local Minsky cyborgs, and emplacing regulons everywhere. The expected attack never arrived. Somewhere the programming complexity became too large and the AI broke down; the system became the breeding ground for selfish replicators, ai viruses and nanocreatures preying on each other. The the system is still inhabited by a vital and weird nanotech ecology, by now quite benign. This type of organisational breakdown of ISO structures is today commonly called a Denebola collapse (it has been popularly argued that the Surreal Rash is such a collapse, but eschatological experts put it in another disaster category, a transcendence drop burst). It has been said that the \\"Denebola War\\" was one of the two great contributing factors to the later absorption of the Combine into the Conver Ambi, the other being Metasoft loss of the Version Tree (and hence, the entire periphery). When Metasoft lost control over the Version Tree, the economy, already seriously impoverished by the Denebola war, suffered further loss of investments and much prestige. The Virginis Combine became a place where the former Metasoft bionts retreated. The Combine became a sort of remnant old school Metasoft. Although the loss of the Version Tree was a heavy blow at the time, Metasoft Bionts soon established a number of new corporations, exploring new technology and options, and quickly consolidating into local Houses and Clades. In order to capture new markets to replace those lost to the vecs, Metasoft Bionts attempted to bring the Combine into the NoCoZo, but the mood in the whole system was very anti-corporate. Animosity towards TakiCorb, one of the founding corporations of the NoCoZo, drove a great number of habitats and demopolies and a large proportion of the many disenfranchised and dissatisfied clades into the arms of the Conver Ambi.\\"","output":"The article is about the \\"Denebola Incident\\" in the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Project.

Believers of the Orwellian Sun view the Sun as a deity that encompasses all aspects of their lives. They believe that this divine figure possesses absolute control and surveillance over the world, watching and influencing every individual's actions, thoughts, and emotions. The Sun is both revered and feared, as it governs the lives of its followers with strict rules and guidelines. The guiding principles of the Orwellian Sun religion revolve around obedience, conformity, and the suppression of free thought. The adherents believe that by adhering to these principles and following the Sun's instructions, they will achieve enlightenment and be allowed to live in a harmonious society. Worship in the Orwellian Sun religion typically involves daily rituals performed at sunrise and sunset, during which followers express their devotion to the Sun through prayers, recitations, and physical acts of submissiveness. These rituals often take place in designated spaces called \\"Sun Centers,\\" where followers gather to collectively reinforce their belief in the Sun's omnipotence. The Orwellian Sun promotes strict surveillance and control over its followers, as a means to ensure societal harmony and conformity. Members are expected to report any perceived deviance or thought-crime to the appropriate authorities, who act as representatives of the Sun's will. This creates an atmosphere of distrust, fear, and self-censorship among the believers, as they strive to align their thoughts and actions with the Sun's mandates. Critics argue that the Orwellian Sun religion is a form of mind control that suppresses individuality and promotes an oppressive regime. They point out the parallels between the religious practices and the themes of surveillance, manipulation, and censorship depicted in Orwell's novel. Supporters, however, believe that the control exerted by the Sun is necessary to maintain order and protect society from chaos and dissent. It is important to note that the Orwellian Sun is purely a fictional concept created for imaginative purposes and does not represent any real-world religion."},{"instruction":"– A reputação te procede, Samanun – disse a princesa, bebendo um gole de vinho tinto – Acho que nunca conseguirei demonstrar o quão grata eu sou por ter me salvado Samanun sabia que aquelas falas estavam recheadas de segundas intenções.

The returning woman had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). * When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her sister, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the sister has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman's flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The sister was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The sister, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the sister fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the sister - who is standing in flat's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman's sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman's way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing sister intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned sister attempts to understand what's wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the sister's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing sister to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the sister's obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting sister inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman's stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed sister is trying to inquire what's wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the sister is applying on the returning woman's stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The sister is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the sister's pressing grip while exerting. The sister asks the returning woman what's the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman's relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The sister attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the sister about an impending stench. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the sister is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the sister what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the sister asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The sister then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the sister to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing sister relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing sister. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the sister, the astonished sister taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished sister continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the sister with a playful sulk that what happened is the sister's fault because she blocked the returning woman's path and pressed the returning woman's stomach forcefully. * The sister playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and mockingly remarks on the seemingly indulgent way in which the returning woman fully finished relieving herself in her pants with what seemed like pleasure while the two women were entangled near the door. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the sister, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the sister delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly acknowledges the sister's observation of her rear end, describing the feeling of her pants being full of so much poop while she gently feels the bulge in her pants with her hand and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The sister mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister's teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman acknowledges the sister's mocking and teasing while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the sister's doing because of the obstruction while opening the door and pressure that the sister applied on the returning woman's stomach. As she is insisting, the returning woman is mischievously fanning odor from her bum towards her sister while pinching her own nose (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing sister waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: A Comedy-Drama TV Series - Mishaps in Motion Background: In the heart of New York City, amidst the chaos of everyday life, we follow the unpredictable and often absurd adventures of Maya Valentine, an African-American woman in her mid-thirties. Maya is bold, vivacious, and unapologetically herself. Maya has a distinct style that sets her apart. She is wearing a vibrant purple jumpsuit with a matching headscarf, accentuating her natural afro. Her sunglasses, shaped like oversized pink hearts, add a dash of whimsy to her ensemble. Maya believes in making a statement with her fashion choices. Scene: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY Maya rounds the corner, clutching her stomach and wincing with each step. Her urgency is visible as she approaches an apartment door. She takes a deep breath before knocking repeatedly. MAYA (desperate) Come on, Faith! Answer the door! Maya tries the doorknob, realizing it's locked. Panic sets in. MAYA (under her breath) No, no, no! Suddenly, a sleepy voice from the other side of the door interrupts Maya's frantic attempts. SISTER (V.O) Hello? Who's there? Maya's eyes widen, dread washing over her. It's her sister, Janelle, who she desperately hoped to avoid this very moment. MAYA (sighing, defeated) Janelle, it's me! Open the door, please! Hurry! Janelle, still groggy from her nap, takes her time opening the door. INT. APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - DAY Janelle swings the door open, revealing a flushed and desperate Maya. Before she can step inside, Janelle grabs onto her arm, concerned. JANELLE What's wrong, Maya? You look like you're about to burst! MAYA (trying to break free) Janelle, move! Let me in! The comedic tension builds as Maya struggles against Janelle's tight grip and attempts to maneuver past her. MAYA (grunting) I need to... get in... now! Janelle, bewildered, releases Maya, finally realizing the severity of the situation. JANELLE (concerned) Okay, okay! Hurry! As Maya tries to enter the apartment, her body tenses, and her face contorts with a mix of horror and untimely relief. MAYA (in shock) O-oh no! It's happening! Janelle, puzzled, tries to comprehend what's going on. JANELLE (recoiling) What is happening? Maya, are you okay? Maya struggles to respond between strained grunts, indicating her relief as she continues pooping her pants. MAYA (strained) I... can't hold it... any longer! A strong, unmistakable odor wafts into Janelle's nostrils, who reacts dramatically. JANELLE (gagging) Oh my god! What is that smell?! Janelle's realization dawns on her, and despite her initial shock, she bursts into laughter. JANELLE (teasingly) You... you actually did it, didn't you? You pooped your pants! Maya, sheepishly indignant, tries to avoid explicitly admitting to her embarrassing incident. MAYA (whispering) Would you please let go and let me in? Janelle, chuckling, steps aside, allowing Maya to gingerly waddle past her into the apartment. INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Maya, still blushing, passes Janelle, who continues to marvel at the absurdity of the situation. JANELLE (mockingly) Look at you, waddling with your poop-filled pants! It's like you're wearing a dirty diaper! Maya sighs, alternating between embarrassed and playful. MAYA (teasingly sulk) Thanks for the teasing. It's all your fault, you know... JANELLE (playfully incredulous) My fault?! I didn't expect you to poop your pants like a toddler! Maya smirks and heads towards the bathroom, determined to clean up. MAYA (resolved) I'll be right back. And trust me, you owe me some serious apologies for this mess! Janelle gently stops Maya, teasingly curious about the extent of the situation. JANELLE (teasingly) I can't believe this. I need to see it with my own eyes. Maya, coyly acknowledging her predicament, shares a playful moment. MAYA (smirking) If you insist, just let me go clean up first. Janelle mimicking the smell and teasingly agreeing with Maya, pulls a face. JANELLE (teasingly) Yes, yes, go clean up! You stink, Maya! Maya holds her nose, playfully fanning the odor towards Janelle. MAYA (mischievously) Well, you deserve a whiff or two! Janelle cringes and waves Maya off toward the bathroom. JANELLE (cackling) Go clean yourself up! And try not to make a habit of this, okay? Maya heads towards the bathroom, laughing at the bizarre turn of events.

Any form of independent thought or expression is severely punished, with citizens facing imprisonment, torture, or even death for questioning the authority. Individual privacy is virtually non-existent in Horribleworld Earth.

FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Describe Earth ruled by worst politics.","output":"In a world where the worst politics govern Earth, chaos and despair reign supreme. The leadership is marred by corruption, deception, and ruthless pursuit of power, leaving the planet in a state of perpetual suffering. Here is an insight into an Earth ruled by the worst politics: 1. Corruption and nepotism: The governing system is riddled with corruption, where politicians exploit their positions for personal gain. Public funds earmarked for development projects are embezzled, leaving infrastructure crumbling and basic services neglected. Nepotism runs rampant, with leaders appointing their unqualified family members and friends to crucial positions, resulting in incompetence and a lack of effective governance. 2. Authoritarianism and suppression of dissent: Freedom of speech, expression, and assembly are crushed under the oppressive rule. Critics of the regime are silenced through intimidation, imprisonment, or even elimination. Media outlets are tightly controlled, spreading propaganda rather than objective information. Independent thought and the right to challenge authority are stifled, creating an atmosphere of fear and hopelessness. 3. Socioeconomic inequality: The ruling class thrives on an economic system that perpetuates immense wealth disparities. The wealthy elite hoard resources and exploit the masses, exacerbating poverty and inequality. Social safety nets are dismantled, leaving the vulnerable without access to crucial healthcare, education, and basic necessities. The rich become richer, while the majority struggle to survive. 4. Deteriorating environmental conditions: The worst politics neglect environmental concerns in favor of short-term economic gains. Environmental regulations are weakened, leading to pollution, deforestation, and the depletion of natural resources. Climate change accelerates as leaders deny and ignore its devastating consequences, leaving the planet on a dangerous trajectory towards environmental collapse. 5. International isolation and conflicts: The worst politics breed international tensions and conflicts due to their lack of diplomacy and negotiation. Relations with other nations are strained, which heightens the risk of military conflicts and destabilization. Cooperation on global issues such as poverty, disease, and terrorism is neglected, jeopardizing human progress and well-being. 6. Erosion of human rights: Under this governance, human rights are disregarded and violated without consequence. Discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation is institutionalized, fostering an environment of intolerance and prejudice. Basic human rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and security, are trampled upon, leaving individuals vulnerable and devoid of justice. 7. Lack of accountability: The worst politics lack accountability and a commitment to the rule of law. Leaders are immune to legal consequences for their actions, enabling them to act with impunity. Corruption and human rights abuses go unpunished, despite the havoc they wreak on society. In summary, an Earth ruled by the worst politics is a dystopian nightmare, plagued by corruption, inequality, oppression, and a disregard for fundamental human values. It is a bleak world where the aspirations of a better future are crushed and the welfare of the planet and its inhabitants take a back seat to the insatiable thirst for power."},{"instruction":"Make a 10 Female!SCP Harem for Joshua Robertson, and Joshua is a passionate and enthusiastic comic book nerd.

Suddenly, a new student, LUCY, enters the scene. She is visibly excited, wearing a maple leaf pin, carrying a Canadian flag, and speaking with a distinctly Canadian accent. Jane (whispering) Hey guys, check her out. I think she's the new student everyone's talking about. Sam (grinning) Oh wow, she's really going all out with the Canadian theme. That's pretty cool. Aaron Ling (chuckling) Yeah, I've heard she's from Canada. Wonder why she's so obsessed with it though. Lucy spots the trio and walks over to their table, a wide smile on her face. Lucy (excitedly) Hey there, fellow Canucks! Mind if I join you guys? I'm Lucy, straight from the great land of Canada! Jane (smiling) Hey Lucy, sure, have a seat! I'm Jane, and this is Sam and Aaron Ling. We're intrigued by your Canadian spirit. Sam (teasingly) Guess you won't feel homesick anymore with someone who loves Canada that much. Lucy (excitedly) Oh, you have no idea! I moved here a few months ago, and I miss Canada so much. I thought immersing myself in everything Canadian would help. Aaron Ling (raising an eyebrow) But why did you leave Canada in the first place? It's supposed to be awesome, right? Lucy (sighs) My dad got transferred here for work, and I had to move with my family. Don't get me wrong; I love it here, but nothing compares to the good old Canadian vibes. Jane (smiling sympathetically) I can understand missing your home. But hey, we'll make sure you have a great time here too! There's more to this place than poutine and maple syrup, you know? Sam (nudging Jane) Yeah, we'll show you all the cool things about our town. It might not be Canada, but it's pretty awesome in its own way. Lucy (grinning) That sounds amazing! I'm excited to explore everything this place has to offer. But can we still talk about hockey sometimes? Aaron Ling (laughing) Absolutely! We'll even teach you some basketball moves. You know, just so you can have that Canadian-American experience. As the laughter fills the cafeteria, an unexpected bond forms between the four friends. They realize that despite their differences, they share a common goal — to make each other feel at home, regardless of the place they come from. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"What is a Flying Dutchmen in computing?","output":"In computing, Flying Dutchmen refers to a phenomenon where a process or a program continues to run even after its parent process has terminated or its user has logged out. This term originated from the maritime legend of the Flying Dutchman, a ghost ship that was doomed to sail the seas forever. In the context of computing, a Flying Dutchman occurs due to a process or program not being properly terminated or cleaned up when its parent process or user session ends. This can happen if there are bugs or errors in the code that prevent the program from exiting correctly. As a result, the process remains active in the system, consuming resources such as memory or CPU cycles, but with no user or parent program to control it. Flying Dutchmen can cause various issues, such as resource exhaustion, system slowdowns, and instability. They are often considered a form of software or system bug that needs to be identified and fixed to ensure proper functioning of the computer system."},{"instruction":"What is a worm?","output":"In the context of computing, a worm is a type of malicious software or malware that replicates itself and spreads across computer networks or systems without any user intervention. Unlike viruses, worms do not require a host program or file to propagate. They have the ability to self-replicate and spread independently. Once a worm successfully infects a system, it can spread to other vulnerable systems by exploiting security vulnerabilities or by using various communication channels like email, instant messaging, or network shares. Worms typically exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or network protocols, allowing them to quickly infect numerous computers. Worms can cause significant harm to computer networks and systems. They can consume network bandwidth, overload servers, steal sensitive information, or open backdoors to allow remote control of infected systems. Some worms are also designed to deliver payloads, such as ransomware or other forms of malware, which can result in data loss, financial damage, or disruption of network services. To protect against worms, it is important to keep computer systems and software up to date with security patches, use reputable antivirus software, and implement strong network security measures. Additionally, users should exercise caution when opening email attachments or clicking on suspicious links to avoid inadvertently spreading worms or other malware."},{"instruction":"Describe Earth ruled by demonic politics.","output":"In a world ruled by demonic politics, Earth undergoes a profound transformation, transitioning into a terrifying landscape governed by dark forces from beyond. This scenario envisions a society where demons and their principles dominate, shaping every aspect of life and governance on the planet. Power Structure: Under demonic rule, power is concentrated in the hands of malevolent entities, who prioritize their own desires and ambitions over the well-being of humanity. The highest positions of authority are occupied by powerful demon lords or overlords who command legions of obedient followers. These demon rulers enforce their will through fear, manipulation, and a complete disregard for moral values. Oppressive Rule: Demonic politics bring forth an oppressive and nightmarish regime. The ruling class revels in chaos, suffering, and the corruption of souls. They promote anarchy, encouraging constant strife and conflict, as they thrive on the negative energy generated by such conditions. Demonic overlords dictate all aspects of life, controlling the economy, imposing strict laws that suppress human freedoms, and ensuring the widespread worship of abhorrent practices. Pervasive Evil: Under demonic politics, evil pervades every facet of society. Ruthlessness, deceit, and cruelty become the primary traits to survive and succeed in this dystopian world. Moral codes disintegrate, with virtues such as kindness, compassion, and justice being discarded or actively discouraged. The vicious struggle for power fosters an atmosphere of treachery and backstabbing, as individuals compete to appease the demonic overlords and gain favor. Religious Influence: Demonic politics often intertwine with religious belief systems, leading to the rise of dark cults and sacrilegious doctrines. The demon rulers, deifying themselves, demand worship and blind loyalty from the masses. These nefarious beings exploit faith to manipulate and control populations, using religious establishments to further their agenda and ensuring the continued submission of believers. Destruction and Decay: Under demonic rule, Earth undergoes a physical and spiritual decay. Natural resources are ravaged to feed the insatiable hunger of the demons, pushing ecosystems to the brink of collapse and depriving humanity of a sustainable future. Cities become hives of darkness and despair, infused with twisted architecture and ominous landscapes that serve as reminders of the demonic presence. Resistance and Hope: Throughout this grim reality, pockets of resistance may emerge. Individuals, inspired by the remnants of their former humanity and driven by hope, band together to fight against the demonic oppression. These rebels navigate an extremely treacherous landscape, engaging in clandestine operations to undermine the demonic regime, protect the vulnerable, and preserve whatever fragments of goodness remain. In summary, an Earth ruled by demonic politics plunges humanity into an all-encompassing darkness. Governance is dictated by malevolent demon lords, who exploit fear, chaos, and corruption. The pervasiveness of evil and the suppression of human virtues mark every aspect of life, while religious influence is twisted to serve the demonic agenda. Despite the oppressive regime, small glimmers of resistance fight to restore humanity's moral compass and reclaim the shattered world."},{"instruction":"Describe Earth ruled by demonic politics: Totalitarian religion and anti-rebellious language.","output":"In a world ruled by demonic politics, Earth is subjected to the iron fist of a totalitarian religious regime, backed by the dominion of dark forces. This scenario depicts a society where a malevolent religion is forcefully imposed on the populace, suppressing any form of rebellion or dissent through strict control over language and thought. Totalitarian Religion: Under demonic rule, a theocratic system takes hold, with the demonic overlords manipulating religious beliefs to solidify their power. The populace is subjected to a dogmatic and oppressive religious doctrine that enforces the complete subjugation of individuals to the will of the demons. This religion idolizes demonic figures and demands unwavering loyalty and obedience, using fear of eternal damnation to maintain control. Anti-Rebellious Language: In this demonic regime, the use of language is strictly regulated to prevent any expression of dissent or rebellion. A pervasive system of surveillance and informants ensures that anyone speaking against the regime is swiftly identified and punished. Public discourse becomes heavily censored, with words and phrases that challenge or criticize the demonic authority either eradicated from the lexicon or twisted in meaning to serve the regime's propaganda. Thought Control: The demonic overlords exert powerful mind-control over the masses, stifling independent thought and creativity. Through indoctrination, propaganda, and manipulation of information, they mold the minds of the people to align with their demonic agenda. Critical thinking is denounced as heresy, and an environment of fear and paranoia is fostered, discouraging any dissenting thoughts or questioning of the established order. Rebellion Suppression: Any form of rebellion or resistance is met with brutal force, as the demonic regime maintains a pervasive surveillance state. Surveillance cameras, informants, and secret police roam the streets, ensuring the population's compliance. Those suspected of rebelling are swiftly captured, tortured, or executed, instilling fear among potential dissenters and discouraging any challenges to the demonic authority. Systematic Oppression: Under demonic religious rule, individual liberties are stripped away, and oppression becomes the norm. Dissidents and marginalized groups are systematically targeted and subjected to discrimination, persecution, and violence. Basic human rights are trampled upon, with dissenters locked away in labor camps or subjected to ritualistic executions meant to instill terror and maintain the regime's grip on power. Hope Amidst Tyranny: Despite the suffocating environment, there may be pockets of resistance and individuals who hold on to the spark of hope. Secret underground networks may form, working tirelessly to regain freedom and overthrow the demonic regime. These rebels communicate through coded language and clandestine meetings, using their resilience and resourcefulness to fight for a future free from the clutches of demonic politics. In summary, in a world ruled by demonic politics, an oppressive and totalitarian religious regime controls every aspect of life. Strict control over language and thought suppress rebellion and dissent, while brutal suppression tactics ensure compliance. Individual liberties are crushed, and marginalized groups suffer under discriminatory practices. However, even in the darkest corners, resistance persists, driven by the resilience and hope for a future where humanity can break free from the oppressive grip of demonic rulers."},{"instruction":"Can you please correct this VBA event, Several conditions are being triggered: Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range) Dim newRow As Long If Target.CountLarge > 1 Then Exit Sub If Not Intersect(Target, Range(\\"I6:I505\\")) Is Nothing Then ' COLUMN I FOR SERVICE COMPLETED DATE If IsDate(Target.Value) And Target.Offset(0, -7).Value <> \\"Service\\" Then ActiveSheet.Range(\\"B\\" & Target.Row).Select MsgBox \\"Please change the Issue description (column B) as required.\\", vbInformation, \\"ISSUE\\" End If Exit Sub If Not Intersect(Target, Range(\\"I6:I505\\")) Is Nothing Then ' COLUMN I FOR SERVICE COMPLETED DATE If IsDate(Target.Value) And Target.Offset(0, -7).Value = \\"Service\\" Then If Target.Offset(0, -1).Value <= DateAdd(\\"d\\", 14, Date) And Target.Value = \\"\\" Then Dim result As VbMsgBoxResult result = MsgBox(\\"NEXT DUE DATE MORE THAN 30 DAYS FROM TODAY!\\" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & _ \\"Have you entered the completed Date\\" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & _ \\"using the format dd/mm/yyyy\\" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & _ \\"Click YES to proceed -

Quels risques pour le conducteurs avec l’assurance et quel risque de contrôle possible sur les gamma gt ou stupéfiant ?","output":"Je ne suis pas un expert en assurance ou en droit, mais je peux vous donner quelques informations générales. En ce qui concerne l'assurance, la plupart des compagnies d'assurance ont des clauses dans leurs contrats qui excluent la couverture en cas de conduite en état d'ébriété. Cela signifie que si l'un des conducteurs impliqués dans l'accident est signalé comme étant alcoolisé sur le constat, il est possible que l'assureur refuse de couvrir les dommages matériels ou corporels liés à l'accident. En ce qui concerne les contrôles sur les gamma GT (marqueurs des dommages au foie) ou les stupéfiants, cela dépend des lois et réglementations spécifiques du pays où vous vous trouvez. Dans de nombreux pays, la police peut effectuer des contrôles de dépistage d'alcoolémie ou de stupéfiants sur les conducteurs impliqués dans un accident, même s'il n'y a pas de blessés. Si vous êtes testé positif à l'alcool ou à d'autres substances illicites, cela peut avoir des conséquences, telles que la suspension ou l'annulation de votre permis de conduire, des amendes, des peines de prison ou d'autres sanctions, en plus des conséquences possibles sur votre assurance automobile.

Here's how you can do it: 1. Assuming you have a large dataset in columns A and B, with the value you want to lookup in cell E2, and you want to return the corresponding value from column B to cell F2. 2. In cell F2, enter the following formula: =VLOOKUP(E2, A:B, 2, FALSE) - E2: The value you want to lookup. - A:B: The range of your dataset. - 2: The column number from which you want to return the value (in this case, column B). - FALSE: Exact match indicator. Set it to FALSE to find an exact match. 3. Press Enter to get the result. The VLOOKUP function will search for the value in E2 within the first column of the range A:B.

This twisted reality is characterized by a draconian state that enables the demons to maintain an iron grip on power. Their governance is marked by strict and unforgiving laws, leaving no room for dissent or opposition. Under such demonic rule, any form of rebellion or disobedience is met with severe consequences. The demons, possessing supernatural powers, ensure that their authority is unchallenged. The mere thought of rebellion is immediately suppressed, with any rebellious individuals suffering swift and brutal punishment. Religion plays a crucial role in this dystopian society, but it is a totalitarian one driven by the demonic rulers. The demon-led religion is all-encompassing, dictating every aspect of life and leaving no space for other beliefs or ideologies. Any deviation from the prescribed religious practices is considered heresy, leading to severe persecution or even death. The language in this demonic society is strictly regulated, with an emphasis on anti-rebellious rhetoric. The demons control the narrative by manipulating language to suppress any ideas, thoughts, or discussions that might challenge their rule. Terms and phrases promoting liberation or resistance are actively discouraged, replaced with propaganda that glorifies the demonic regime. The stability that prevails in this malevolent rule is not born out of harmonious coexistence, but rather a result of fear and oppression. The demonic politics leave no room for dissent, stifling the hopes and dreams of the populace. The majority live in constant terror, subjugated by an unforgiving regime that values control above all else. Those who dare to resist must navigate a treacherous path, always aware of the consequences that await them. In this twisted version of Earth, demonic politics have created a suffocating and oppressive society. Super stability achieved through fear, a draconian state, totalitarian religion, and an anti-rebellious language ensure that the demonic rulers maintain their stranglehold on power.

A portal to the demonic realm was inadvertently opened, allowing legions of malevolent creatures to pour into our world. Humanity, caught off guard and ill-prepared, was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer power and darkness of the demonic forces. 2023 - 2030: The Great Conquest The Demonic Empire wasted no time in conquering nations and subjugating populations across the globe. With their supernatural abilities and insidious tactics, the demonic armies swiftly established dominance and established a new world order. Resistance was met with swift and brutal retribution, leaving little hope for those who dared to challenge the demonic rule. 2031 - 2060: Dark Rule and Oppression In the decades that followed, the Demonic Empire consolidated its power, forcing humanity to submit to their draconian policies and brutal laws. Society underwent a painful transformation, as the demons twisted the fabric of human existence to suit their needs. Cities descended into chaos, now governed by demons and their loyal human collaborators. 2061 - 2080: Totalitarian Religion and Indoctrination Over time, the Demonic Empire systematically imposed its totalitarian religion on the populace. Temples dedicated to the infernal deities sprung up across every corner of the globe, their influence reaching even the most remote communities. The demons enforced strict adherence to this religion, punishing any deviations with severe consequences. The indoctrination was so deeply ingrained that a majority of the population now blindly followed the demonic faith. 2081 - 2100: Suppressing Rebellion and Eradicating Hope With rebellious sentiment quashed and hope systematically eradicated, the Demonic Empire tightened its grip on humanity. The demons and their agents manipulated language and propaganda to ensure conformity and suppress any thoughts or ideas that challenged their rule. Dissenters were hunted down mercilessly, disappearing into the depths of demon-controlled prisons or meeting a grim fate. 2101 - Present: The Descent into Eternal Night As the centuries rolled on, the once-vibrant Earth became a desolate and bleak realm under the eternal night of demonic rule. The Demonic Empire's influence permeated every aspect of life, stifling individuality, and extinguishing the flames of hope. Humanity, stripped of its dignity and autonomy, now exists as mere subjects in a nightmarish reality. Though resistance flickers in the hearts of few brave souls, the Demonic Empire remains an unyielding force that seems impossible to overthrow.

Uneori, este necesară colaborarea cu școli sau instituții pentru a avea acces la adolescenți și pentru a obține consimțământul părinților sau tutorelor legali. 2. Confidențialitate și anonimat: În cazul unui studiu asupra consumului de alcool la adolescenți, este importantă asigurarea confidențialității și protecția datelor personale ale participanților.

Validitatea și sinceritatea răspunsurilor: Adolescenții pot fi reticenți în a divulga cantitatea și frecvența reală a consumului de alcool din cauza teamelor întâlnite (de exemplu, teama de sancțiuni sau stigmatizare). Astfel, obținerea de informații valide și sincere poate fi o provocare. 4. Interferența factorilor externi: Consumul de alcool la adolescenți poate fi influențat de mulți factori, cum ar fi influența grupului de prieteni, mediul familial, publicitatea și disponibilitatea alcoolului. Este dificil să păstrați controlul asupra tuturor acestor factori în timpul alcătuirii studiului și în timpul colectării datelor. 5.

Для этого, вам нужно узнать IP-адрес базы данных внутри докер-сети и заменить \`db\` на этот адрес в строке \`sqlalchemy.url\`. 3) Если ваш контейнер с базой данных работает в отдельной докеровской сети, вы можете добавить контейнер базы данных в одну сеть с контейнером вашего приложения, чтобы они могли видеть друг друга. Для этого, в вашем compose-файле можно добавить секцию \`networks\` в сервисе приложения и указать имя сети, в которой находится контейнер с базой данных. Пример: \`\`\` networks: default: external: name: имя_сети_базы_данных \`\`\` Проверьте вышеперечисленные моменты и попробуйте снова. Если проблема не решена, уточните настройки сети и окружения, и предоставьте более подробную информацию, чтобы мы могли более точно помочь вам."},{"instruction":"На какой ip поменять то?","output":"Если ваш контейнер с базой данных находится в той же докеровской сети, что и контейнер с приложением, вы можете заменить \\"db\\" на IP-адрес контейнера с базой данных в строке \`sqlalchemy.url\`. Чтобы узнать IP-адрес контейнера с базой данных внутри докер-сети, выполните следующие шаги: 1) Запустите команду \`docker network inspect <имя_вашей_докер_сети>\`, чтобы получить информацию о сети, в которой находится контейнер с базой данных. Вам понадобится найти секцию \`\\"Containers\\"\`, где перечислены все контейнеры, присоединенные к сети. 2) Найдите контейнер с базой данных в списке и найдите его IP-адрес в поле \`\\"IPv4Address\\"\`. Обычно он будет иметь формат \`<IP_адрес_контейнера>/<сетевая_маска>\`. 3) Используйте только IP-адрес (без сетевой маски) в строке \`sqlalchemy.url\`, заменив \\"db\\". Пример: \`\`\` sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://admin:admin@<IP_адрес_контейнера>:5432/db \`\`\` Будьте внимательны, IP-адрес контейнера может измениться после его перезапуска или миграции. Если у вас динамические IP-адреса контейнеров, вам может потребоваться настроить DNS-префиксы или динамическое обновление DNS для обеспечения надежного подключения.

These demonic rulers have established an iron grip on power, promoting super stability through draconian state control, an Orwellian religion, and suppressing any form of rebellion using anti-rebellious language. The first characteristic of this demonic rule is an unparalleled sense of stability that is forcibly maintained. The demonic politicians employ various means to prevent any challenges to their authority. They enforce a draconian state apparatus, where laws are strict, and dissent is ruthlessly crushed. Surveillance is pervasive, with advanced technologies used to monitor every aspect of citizens' lives, ensuring compliance with the demonic regime's dictates. The religious aspect of this society is at the core of the demonic political system. An Orwellian religion has been imposed, designed to keep the population subservient and unquestioning. This religion perpetuates the supremacy of the demonic rulers and their twisted ideology. Its teachings incorporate fear, punishment, and obedience, compelling citizens to revere the demonic leaders as demigods while suppressing critical thinking or free thought. To preserve their rule, the demonic politics employs anti-rebellious language, which effectively stifles any opposition. Expressions of dissent are seen as treasonous acts and attract severe consequences. Public discourse is tightly regulated, with news and information strictly controlled to manipulate and mold public opinion. Propaganda and disinformation campaigns misleadingly present the demonic regime as a source of stability and security, further perpetuating their control over the masses. Individual freedoms are drastically curtailed in this demonic political system. Citizens are stripped of their rights and subjugated to strict rules and regulations. Any attempt to challenge or question the authorities is met with severe punishment, which often leads to public displays of oppression as a deterrent to rebellion. In this dark and unsettling scenario, the Earth ruled by demonic politics showcases a society where super stability is only a facade, maintained through an oppressive draconian state, a manipulative Orwellian religion, and the widespread use of anti-rebellious language. The inhabitants of this Earth are trapped in a cycle of fear, subservience, and control, their hopes for freedom and liberty crushed under the weight of demonic rule."},{"instruction":"If demonic empire appeared on Earth, write history and timeline, year started on 2023.","output":"Timeline of the Demonic Empire on Earth: 2023: The Rise of Darkness - In this year, a cataclysmic event occurs when portals to the demonic realms open across the globe.

Human societies are forced to bend to the will of their demonic overlords, enduring unimaginable suffering under their rule. 2031: The Rise of Resistance - Despite the overwhelming power of the demons, pockets of resistance begin to emerge. Brave individuals and underground movements initiate acts of defiance against the Demonic Empire, fueling a flicker of hope in the hearts of humanity. These resistance cells aim to gather strength, inspire others, and ultimately spark a revolution against their infernal oppressors. 2032-2040: The Struggle for Freedom - Over the following years, the human resistance grows and evolves, becoming a formidable force. Guerrilla warfare, acts of sabotage, and covert operations are employed to disrupt the demonic empire's grip on power.

In a climactic showdown, humanity and their newfound allies from various realms join forces to challenge the infernal oppressors. This battle of epic proportions sets the stage for the ultimate struggle between good and evil. 2046: The Demonic Empire's Downfall - Against all odds, the combined forces of humanity, mythical creatures, and beings from realms beyond succeed in toppling the demonic empire. The demons are banished back to their infernal realms, their grip on Earth shattered. The Demonic Empire is no more, and humanity begins the arduous task of rebuilding their shattered world. 2047 and beyond: The Era of Rebuilding - With the defeat of the demons, humankind embarks on a long and challenging journey of recovery and reconstruction. Efforts are made to mend the scars inflicted by the Demonic Empire and restore a sense of normalcy to Earth.

Донни - режиссер-документалист и уроженец солнечной Флориды, оказался настолько зачарован тайной Дятловцев, что не побоялся совершить зимний переход к месту их гибели. Дневник своего собственного похода, перемежающийся с реконструкцией похода студентов в далеком 1959 году и составляет канву книги. А кроме этого Донни делится собственными впечатлениями о путешествии в русскую глубинку. Иногда читать их забавно, иногда грустно, но очень интересно. Все-таки увлеченные каким-то делом люди сильно отличаются от праздных публицистов, главная задача которых - зло и с напором критиковать все и вся. Уж очень в последнее время грешат этим наши отечественные супер-блогеры. В данном случае русским людям и так понятно, что должен испытать американец, попав в середине зимы из Майами на вокзал города Серова, но к чести автора можно сказать, описал он все увиденное вполне корректно, даже трогательно. Донни сам честно признается, что некоторые вещи его, мягко скажем, удивляли, но это было не так важно. Его манила Тайна, ради которой он был готов терпеть любые неудобства, и которую, кстати, вполне разумно сумел объяснить, как для себя, так и для читателей. Его версия гибели группы Дятлова объясняет очень многое и на мой взгляд, очень даже имеет право на существование. Книга отличная, читается легко и приятно. А еще важно помнить, что она была написана американцем для американцев, поэтому стоит простить автору некоторые наивные исторические справки, которыми он пытался хоть как-то объяснить своим читателям реалии СССР конца 50-х. А еще поблагодарить его за то, что не считает нас Империей Зла, и не связывает гибель студентов с происками спецслужб или жестокостью тогдашнего режима. Сама я, кстати, считаю шпионскую версию весьма перспективной, но приятно, что американец ее не пропагандирует. В наших внутренних проблемах мы сами разберемся, и дай Бог, чтобы версия Донни оказалась не так далека от истины. \\"","output":"En ces temps agités, il est très agréable de lire un livre d'un Américain qui parle avec tant de chaleur de la Russie.

Nyugtató lehet számukra látni, hogy az ilyen típusú fenyegetésekkel szemben védekezel, és szabadon használhatod a számítógépedet anélkül, hogy aggódnod kellene a vírus jelenléte miatt. Az ilyenkor általában kifejezett megértés és dicséret járhat, hogy kiemelt figyelmet fordítottál a számítógéped biztonságára és gondoskodsz róla. A barátaid valószínűleg támogatni fognak téged és elismerik, hogy proaktív vagy a biztonság terén. Ez egy jó alkalom arra, hogy megoszd velük, hogy milyen intézkedéseket hozol a számítógéped védelme érdekében, például rendszeres vírusdefiníció frissítések, tűzfal beállítások, és böngészés során a gyanús webhelyek elkerülése. Fontos azonban megjegyezni, hogy mindenki saját példával találkozik a számítógépes biztonság terén, és a vélemények eltérhetnek. Fontos, hogy mindig legyél óvatos a megosztott fájlok, linkek és webhelyek megnyitásakor, hogy elkerüld a potenciális kártékony szoftverek fertőzését."},{"instruction":"Ha látják hogyecdl forrásfajlokban volt a kártevő","output":"Ha a barátaid látják a Defender előzményeit és észreveszik, hogy a kártevő a forrásfájlokban volt jelen, lehet, hogy némi aggodalmat vált ki belőlük. Az ECDL forrásfájlokban való jelenléte azt sugallhatja, hogy a kártevő esetlegesen a számítógépeden található fájlokra és dokumentumokra is hatással volt. Ebben az esetben fontos nyugtázni, hogy a Windows Defender sikeresen megtisztította a rendszert és a fertőzött fájlokat karanténba helyezte. Ez azt jelenti, hogy a kártevő inaktívvá vált és nem jelent veszélyt a számítógépedre. Az ECDL forrásfájlokban való jelenlét azonban azt is jelentheti, hogy ezeket a fájlokat már fertőzte a kártevő. Ebben az esetben javaslom, hogy a barátaid is futtassanak egy víruskereső szkennelést a saját számítógépeiken, és frissítsék a vírusdefiníciós adatbázist, hogy biztosak legyenek a rendszerük biztonságában. Ezen túlmenően, lehet, hogy érdemes néhány alapvető biztonsági intézkedést megosztani velük, például a rendszeres vírusvédelmi frissítéseket, erős jelszavak használatát és a gyanús e-mailek vagy letöltések elkerülését. Fontos hangsúlyozni, hogy a számítógépes biztonság mindenkinek különös figyelmet igényel, és a megfelelő intézkedések segíthetnek megelőzni a kártékony szoftverek fertőzését és terjedését."},{"instruction":"A Windows defender olyan mint az embernek az immunrendszere","output":"Igen, a hasonlatot elő lehet venni ahhoz, hogy a Windows Defender hasonlóan működik, mint az emberi immunrendszer. Az immunrendszer feladata az, hogy felismerje és elpusztítsa a testbe jutó káros mikroorganizmusokat vagy idegen anyagokat, és megvédje a szervezetet a fertőzésektől. Hasonló módon a Windows Defender is folyamatosan figyeli és ellenőrzi a számítógépet az esetleges káros szoftverek vagy vírusok felismerése érdekében. Amikor a Defender észlel egy gyanús vagy potenciálisan kártékony fájlt, elindítja a víruskeresési folyamatot, és megpróbálja azonosítani és eltávolítani a fenyegetést. Ahogyan az immunrendszerünk is idővel fejlődik és tanul az új kórokozókkal való küzdelemben, úgy a Windows Defender is frissítésekkel és új vírusdefiníciókkal rendelkezik, hogy felismerje és hatékonyan védekezzen az új és ismeretlen káros szoftverek ellen. A hasonlat azért jól működik, mert mind az immunrendszerünk, mind a Windows Defender védi a testünket, illetve a számítógépet a potenciális veszélyektől és fenyegetésektől, és mindkettőnek fontos szerepe van komolyabb problémák elkerülésében."},{"instruction":"Az immunrendszer folyamatosan valós időben figyeli a szervezetet","output":"Igen, igazad van. Az immunrendszerünk folyamatosan és valós időben figyeli a szervezetünket az esetleges fertőzések vagy betegségek jeleinek felismerésére. Amint az immunrendszer észlel egy idegen vagy káros anyagot, például baktériumokat vagy vírusokat, az aktiválódik és megkezdi a reakcióját a fertőzés kezelésére. Hasonlóképpen a Windows Defender is folyamatosan figyeli a számítógépet valós időben a kártékony szoftverek vagy vírusok felismerése érdekében. Amint a Defender észlel egy gyanús tevékenységet vagy fertőzési kísérletet, azonnal reagál és megpróbálja blokkolni vagy eltávolítani a fenyegetést. Ez valós időben történik, és a feladata, hogy megakadályozza a káros szoftverek kártékony működését és terjedését a rendszeren belül. Az immunrendszer és a Windows Defender hasonlóságai közé tartozik tehát az is, hogy mindkettő folyamatosan és valós időben figyeli a potenciális veszélyeket, és reagál azokra a legjobb képességei szerint a szervezet vagy a számítógép védelme érdekében."},{"instruction":"A memória t sejtek= vírus definíció adatbázis","output":"Igen, a memória T sejtek az immunrendszer fontos elemei, amelyek a fertőzésekkel szemben hosszú távú immunitást biztosítanak.

Hasonlóképpen a vírusdefiníció adatbázis a Windows Defender fontos eleme, amely a káros szoftverek felismeréséhez és eltávolításához szükséges információkat tartalmazza. Ez az adatbázis rendszeresen frissül a legújabb vírusdefiníciókkal, amelyek az új és ismeretlen fenyegetések azonosításában és ellenük való védekezésben segítenek. A vírusdefiníció adatbázis egészségesen hasonlítható a memória T sejtekhez, mivel mindkettő információkat tartalmaz és használ fel a kórokozók vagy káros szoftverek felismeréséhez. Az immunrendszerben a memória T sejtek hosszú távú védelmet nyújtanak a fertőzésekkel szemben, míg a vírusdefiníció adatbázis a Windows Defenderben folyamatosan frissül, hogy azonosítsa és védelmet nyújtson az újabb fenyegetések ellen."},{"instruction":"A memória t sejtekben hogy tárolodik adat","output":"A memória T sejtek a specifikus immunológiai válaszból származnak, amikor a túlélő effektorsejtekből differenciálódnak ki.

Growing up together, they were both fascinated by the rich culture and traditions of the Diné people. While Jordan eagerly studied and immersed himself in their myths and faiths, Kaito found inspiration in one particular figure—Coyote, the mischievous trickster. One sunny afternoon, as the two friends sat under the shade of a giant cottonwood tree, Kaito excitedly boasted, \\"Hey Jordan, you know what? I feel like Coyote whenever I have a good idea.\\" Curiosity sparked within Jordan's deep brown eyes as he questioned, \\"But Kaito, from what I've read, Coyote's 'good ideas' usually end up causing more trouble than good, right?\\" Kaito chuckled mischievously, his jet-black hair dancing in the desert breeze. \\"Exactly, my friend! Coyote's tricks often lead to amusing chaos. But that's precisely what makes him so fascinating. Sometimes, even the craziest ideas can teach us valuable lessons.\\" Intrigued by Kaito's perspective, Jordan leaned in, urging him to continue. A sly grin spread across Kaito's face, whispering, \\"Let me tell you a story, a real-life Coyote tale.\\" Kaito's tale began in the nearby town, where the annual Navajo Youth Talent Show was held. Unlike previous years, this time it was not just restricted to traditional performances. A brilliant idea entered Kaito's mind, reminding him of Coyote's antics. \\"Jordan, picture this,\\" Kaito began, his voice filled with excitement. \\"I suggested to the organizers that we create an 'Anything Goes' category where the Navajo youth could showcase their unique talents in any way they desired! I knew it would add an unexpected twist to the event.\\" Jordan raised an eyebrow, somewhat skeptical but intrigued. He questioned, \\"And how did this idea play out? I assume there were some unexpected turn of events?\\" Kaito's eyes sparkled with mischief as he continued his tale. \\"Oh, you have no idea. The day of the talent show arrived, and the Anything Goes category was the talk of the town. We had everything, from traditional dance performances to rap battles, from painting exhibitions to magic shows. It was truly a diverse representation of our people's talents.\\" Jordan's doubt began to dissipate, replaced by a growing fascination. \\"That sounds incredible! But how did Coyote's mischievous touch manifest in this?\\" Kaito burst into laughter, reminiscing about the chaos that followed. \\"Ah, my friend, here comes the mischievous part. You see, there was this one aspiring young fire dancer. He decided to showcase his talent on the stage, juggling flaming torches. But, alas! His coordination faltered, and one of the burning torches flew off, landing directly in the judges' table!\\" Amused by the image painted by Kaito's words, Jordan couldn't help but join in the laughter. \\"So, Coyote's trick truly had unexpected consequences. But what did this teach you, Kaito?\\" Kaito's laughter subsided, and a thoughtful expression emerged on his face. \\"It taught me that even our quirkiest, most outlandish ideas have the potential to open doors, break boundaries, and create something remarkable. The mishaps along the way make our experiences even more memorable and help us grow.\\" The two friends sat quietly, the desert wind whispering ancient wisdom through the cottonwood leaves. Jordan turned to Kaito, a newfound respect in his eyes. \\"Kaito, your perspective is something truly special. Your mischievous connection to Coyote infuses even the simplest of ideas with a spark of adventure. It reminds us to never fear the unknown, even if it leads to unexpected outcomes.\\" Kaito grinned, their bond forever sealed through their shared fascination with Coyote's antics. As the sun began its descent over the breathtaking landscape of the Navajo Nation, the friends reveled in the lessons bestowed upon them by the trickster spirit, embracing the thrilling uncertainty that lay ahead."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Closed chain exercises: These exercises involve performing movements where the distal segment (e.g., hand or foot) is fixed in space and bearing weight. In closed chain exercises, the joint forces are distributed through multiple joints rather than isolated to a specific joint. Examples of closed chain exercises include squats, lunges, push-ups, and step-ups. Closed chain exercises are generally considered more joint-stabilizing and functional. In the context of JHS, closed chain exercises can be beneficial as they promote joint stability and control. Since individuals with JHS may have excessive joint mobility, closed chain exercises help train surrounding muscles to stabilize and support the joint, reducing the risk of injury and improving overall joint stability. 2. Open chain exercises: These exercises involve movements where the distal segment (e.g., hand or foot) is not fixed in space and not bearing weight. Examples of open chain exercises include bicep curls, leg extensions, and hamstring curls. Open chain exercises isolate specific joints and focus on strengthening specific muscles around those joints. In children with JHS, caution may be needed when prescribing open chain exercises. These exercises may place excessive stress on the joint, leading to hyperextension or instability. Open chain exercises can be included as part of a comprehensive exercise program for JHS participants, but they should be carefully selected and monitored to avoid exacerbating joint hypermobility. It is essential that any exercise program for children with JHS is tailored to their specific needs, considering individual joint mobility, strength, and any associated symptoms. Consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a physical therapist or pediatric specialist, can help design a safe and effective exercise program for children with JHS."},{"instruction":"what is the most effect?","output":"There is no definitive answer as to which type of exercise (closed chain or open chain) is more effective for children with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS), as it can vary depending on the individual and their specific needs and goals. Both types of exercises can have benefits and should ideally be included as part of a well-rounded exercise program. Closed chain exercises are generally considered more joint-stabilizing and functional. They help improve joint stability and control, and strengthen the muscles around the joint. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals with JHS as it can help reduce the risk of injury and improve overall joint stability. On the other hand, open chain exercises can be useful for isolating and targeting specific muscles, which can be beneficial for improving muscle strength and addressing any muscle imbalances that may be present. However, caution may be needed when prescribing open chain exercises for individuals with JHS to avoid exacerbating joint hypermobility. The most effective exercise program for children with JHS typically involves a combination of closed chain and open chain exercises, along with other interventions and considerations such as flexibility training, proprioceptive training, and education on joint protection and body mechanics.

This groundbreaking legislation set the stage for the system's continued growth and development. Over the years, Scotland has further refined its educational policies and practices, making it a model for other nations. Learner-Centered Approach: Central to the Scottish education system is the belief in a learner-centered approach.

It emphasizes a more holistic and comprehensive approach that encompasses both formative and summative assessment methods. Teachers employ a range of assessment strategies, including continuous assessment, projects, portfolios, and exams, to provide a more accurate understanding of students' progress and abilities. Inclusive Education: Scotland is committed to achieving inclusive education that ensures equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their background or abilities. The Additional Support for Learning Act (2004) reinforces this commitment, providing additional resources and support to meet the diverse needs of students, including those with disabilities, learning difficulties, or English as a second language. Inclusive education fosters a supportive and nurturing environment that promotes educational success and social integration. Teacher Professionalism and Collaboration: The Scottish education system values highly qualified teachers who are continuously supported in their professional development. Teachers undergo rigorous training, and teaching standards are closely monitored through the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS). Collaboration is also emphasized, with teachers encouraged to work together, share best practices, and engage in professional learning communities, fostering a culture of innovation and excellence. Higher Education Opportunities: Scotland boasts a strong higher education sector, with world-class universities renowned for their academic excellence and research output. Students who graduate from Scottish schools have access to a wide range of opportunities to continue their education in universities and colleges, both within and outside Scotland. The Scottish education system provides a strong foundation for lifelong learning and personal growth. Conclusion: The Scottish education system's commitment to learner-centered education, personalization, inclusivity, and lifelong learning has positioned it as a global leader in educational excellence. With a focus on holistic development, the system continuously adapts to meet the evolving needs of students and society.

It is important to note that gambling, including betting, involves risks, and there is no guaranteed way to win or make value bets consistently. However, if you're interested in betting, here are some general tips to consider: 1. Research and gather information: Before placing any bets, conduct thorough research and gather relevant information about the teams, players, or participants involved. Analyze their recent form, statistics, injuries, team dynamics, and head-to-head records. This information can help you make more informed decisions. 2. Understand the odds and probabilities: Familiarize yourself with the concept of odds and probabilities in betting. Learn how to interpret the odds and calculate the implied probability to assess the value of a bet. Look for instances where the odds offered by the bookmakers may not accurately reflect the true probability. 3. Set a budget and manage it responsibly: Determine how much money you are willing to risk and set a budget for your betting activities. Establish clear limits and avoid chasing losses. Responsible bankroll management is essential to ensure you don't overspend or become overly reliant on gambling. 4. Use betting strategies: Consider utilizing various betting strategies such as the Martingale system, Fibonacci sequence, or value betting. These strategies provide different approaches to managing bets based on predetermined rules. However, keep in mind that no strategy is foolproof, and results may vary. 5. Be selective: Don't be tempted to bet on every event or game. Instead, focus on specific markets or sports that you have knowledge about and feel more confident in predicting outcomes. Being selective about your bets can help improve your chances of success. 6. Shop around for the best odds: Compare the odds offered by different bookmakers for the same event or game. This practice is known as line shopping. By getting the best odds available, you can maximize your potential returns and take advantage of any discrepancies between bookmakers. 7. Bet with a clear mind and avoid emotional decisions: Ensure you are not influenced by biases, personal preferences, or emotions when placing bets. Emotions can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive or irrational decision-making. Stay objective and base your bets on logical analysis. 8.

This calendar was used in conjunction with the Coordinated Universal Time standard (UTC) to give a single value for timekeeping all over the planet. UTC was adopted throughout the Solar System at first, but once permanent colonies were established on the Moon and Mars new calendars were established for those worlds. The Martian calendar was adopted in 2185 c.e and is based around the 'sol' or Martian Day, having a start date of 14 November 2031 when the first manned landing occurred. The Lunar calendar known as the 'After Tranquility Calendar' (a.t. or A.T.) was established soon after, and takes the first manned landing on the Moon in 1969 c.e. as its starting date. However the Lunar day was considered too long to be useful, so the new calendar retained UTC to count the time of the new colony. By 391 a.t. the majority of the Solar System (apart from Earth and Mars) was using the a.t./UTC standard. After the Great Expulsion several billion refugees from Earth crowded on to the Moon and onto habitats in Cislunar space, waiting for a chance to escape to the roomier colonies of Mars and the Outer Solar System or onto the great Arkships that were being built to carry them to the nearest stars. During this time the Lunar calendar became the common measurement of time for most of the former inhabitants of Earth. The refugees almost always took the 'After Tranquility' calendar with them to their new homes among the stars. Later Luna became the capital of the First Federation in the early years of its formation, and attempted to regularize the measurement of time on an interstellar scale; this of course proved to be impossible. In a universe governed by special relativity it is impossible to say in an absolute sense whether two events occur at the same time if they are separated in space. Time dilation changes the rate at which time passes for any moving object when observed from another moving object; so no common frame of reference can be found to measure the passing of time. On the surface of a planet, or even within a single solar system, it is possible to disregard simultaneity effects for almost all purposes; but once the Terragen Expansion spread from Sol to other planetary systems these effects became very much more important. Interstellar spacecraft and their crews traveling at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light will experience time dilation to a greater or lesser extent according to their velocity; a journey of 6 light years at 0.6 c will take ten years as seen from an observer on the world it left from, but will only take 8 years from the point of view of the crew. Once the ship arrives, the colonists have a number of choices if they want to establish an accurate calendar. They can keep the calendar of the original world, and if they left that world in the year 1000 a.t. for instance they would count a date of 1008 a.t. as their date of arrival. However when they compare notes with the original world (a process which would involve an exchange of messages at light speed, and which would take twelve years) they would find that ten years had passed on the home world, and the calendars would be out of sync. What is worse, the two stars concerned would be so far apart and moving so fast with respect to each other (because of their so-called proper motion) that there is no way to coordinate the rate at which their respective measures of time pass; the two calendars are essentially independent from each other and can never be reconciled. The proper motion of one star with respect to another changes constantly because of the gravitational effects of the rest of the universe, so the effects of time dilation on the measurement of time on each world when compared to the other cannot be measured accurately. So when the First Federation attempted to standardise the After Tranquility calendar across interstellar space they found it was literally impossible. By the end of that period the Terragen Sphere was several hundred light years in radius, and the uncertainty in the calendar date from one side of the volume to the other was a significant factor. When wormhole communication began to spread throughout this expanding sphere there was the chance to establish a new standard. A signal could be sent from any particular world to the centre of the Wormhole Nexus, which has a basically tree-like structure to this day, and is centred upon Aksijaha (also known as Vega) in the Inner Sphere. This signal could be datestamped at the centre of the Nexus and returned to the originating world, and the date at that world could be established as being the time on the datestamp plus half the traveling time to and from the centre. The cultures of the Integration were particularly keen on establishing a common time in this way, and they continued to use the After Tranquility standard. Following on from the Integration, the Sephirotic Empires generally use the a.t. calendar to record significant events, and this is the calendar used at the department of History in Verlibcon Arcology on Ken Ferjik for the Encyclopaedia Galactica. On the other hand, most worlds and habitats and even separate countries or polities within those worlds maintain their own separate calendars, often based on the orbital characteristics of their world and or the date of the foundation of the colony or other momentous events. Mars still uses its original calendar, and the few inhabitants of Earth still use the Gregorian measure; the oldest calendars in use are those of the alien xenosophonts on To'ul'h and Muuhhome, which date back to long before human civilization. However the value of Common time is subject to many effects of simultaneity which makes it an arbitrary measure of time; wormhole linelayers move at considerable fractions of the speed of light, and the ends of the hole can therefore have quite different local time values on arrival. This effect can be modified by the judicious use of gravitational fields at one, or both ends. Also the passage of information through a wormhole can happen at different rates according to exact geometry of the hole. A message from a distant world may need to pass through dozens, or even hundreds, of wormholes, and the transit time can vary considerably over time. So for the outlying worlds Common time, or Empire time as it is sometimes known, is a very variable measure of time, and in no way establishes a single frame of reference for the whole Orion's Arm Civilisation. In any case there are countless worlds in the Outer Volumes and elsewhere which are not linked to the Nexus, so are subject to the same relativistic uncertainties that plagued the First Federation. As the Nexus expands to link with new systems, very often the calendars of the new worlds are very much out of sync with Common Time. For instance the Refugium Empire was almost sixty years adrift when it was finally rediscovered, despite having consistently and accurately used the old Lunar Calendar (although without any attempt at adjusting for relativity). And relativistic polities such as the Deeper Covenant which ply the space between the Sephirotic worlds are accustomed to recalibrating their calendars on arrival, while maintaining accurate ship time as the most important and relevant measure.\\"","output":"The article discusses the different calendars and timekeeping systems used in the Orion's Arm Worldbuilding Project.
