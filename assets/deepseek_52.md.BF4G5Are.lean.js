Geographical barrier: Constantinople was located on a strategically important peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides, making it difficult for land-based forces to siege the city. The heavily fortified walls of Constantinople provided a strong defense against Mongol attacks. 2. Strong defense: Constantinople was known for its formidable fortifications, including massive walls and towers, reinforced with layers of defensive structures. The city had a well-organized defense system and a well-equipped Byzantine army, which made it difficult for Mongol forces to breach the defenses. 3. Naval superiority: The Byzantine Empire had a powerful navy that dominated the surrounding seas, making it virtually impossible for the Mongols to launch a successful naval assault. 4. Diversion of resources: The Mongols were engaged in various military campaigns across their vast empire, which required significant resources and manpower. They had to allocate their forces and military capabilities to other regions, resulting in limited resources for a fully-fledged attack on Constantinople. 5. Diplomacy and alliances: The Byzantine Empire had skillfully managed to forge alliances with other powers, both within the Christian world and with Muslim states. They managed to secure military aid from these alliances, which deterred the Mongols from attacking Constantinople. 6. Logistics and supply lines: The Mongols relied heavily on open steppes for their cavalry-based warfare, providing them with the necessary mobility. The lack of open terrain and the limitations of their logistical capabilities in a siege warfare scenario likely played a role in their decision not to attack Constantinople. 7. Internal conflicts and succession crisis: In the mid-13th century, the Mongol Empire was facing internal conflicts and a succession crisis after the death of Genghis Khan. This diverted their attention and resources away from launching a sustained attack on Constantinople. Overall, a combination of geographical challenges, strong defenses, diplomacy, resource allocation, and internal conflicts prevented the Mongols from successfully taking Constantinople."},{"instruction":"七国之乱","output":"七国之乱指的是中国历史上的战争事件，发生在公元220年至280年间，也称为三国时期末期的动乱时期。此期间中国分裂成了三国魏、蜀、吴，形成了七个割据势力，即东吴、南蛮、益州、冀州、青州、凉州和荆州。这些割据势力在此期间互相征战、扩张，并争夺统一中国的权力。 七国之乱的起因可以追溯到东汉末年，当时朝廷实力渐渐衰弱，政治腐败严重，社会动荡不安。在东汉末年，董卓专权，引发了一系列的内战和动乱。此后，曹操、刘备和孙权等领袖相继崛起，形成了魏、蜀、吴三个大势力。 七国之乱的主要战役有赤壁之战、夷陵之战、官渡之战、华容道之战等等。其中最有名的战役是赤壁之战，刘备和孙权联合击败了曹操的大军，导致曹操无法统一中国。 最终，七国之乱以晋朝的刘渊统一中国而告终，刘渊建立了晋朝，结束了长达60年的动乱时期。七国之乱对于中国历史产生了深远影响，不仅影响了政治格局，也对社会经济和文化产生了重要影响。"},{"instruction":"市局审计延伸工作内容及要求","output":"市局审计延伸工作是指对市级机关、企事业单位以及其他相关单位的财务管理、资产管理、经济效益和内部控制等方面进行审计的工作。它延伸了传统审计的范围，将更多的注意力放在机关单位的规范管理、风险控制和管理效能上。 市局审计延伸工作的内容包括但不限于以下几个方面： 1. 财务管理审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的财务收支、资金使用、会计核算、财务报表等进行审计，查明是否符合财经政策、法律法规和规章制度的要求，是否存在违规违纪行为。 2. 资产管理审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的固定资产、流动资金、存货、应收款项等进行审计，查明资产的归属、流向和安全性，是否存在挪用、浪费、滥用等问题。 3. 经济效益审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的经济效益指标进行审计，包括收入、支出、利润、增减值、成本、效益等方面，评估经营管理的合理性和效果，发现经济效益改善的潜力和问题。 4. 内部控制审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的内部控制制度进行审计，包括组织架构、分工职责、权责清晰度、纪律性和行为规范等方面，评估内控制度的有效性和合规性，发现制度缺陷和改进方向。 市局审计延伸工作的要求包括但不限于以下几点： 1. 专业素质要求：审计人员需要具备扎实的财务、经济学基础知识，熟悉国家有关财经政策法规和审计标准，具备良好的财务分析、风险评估和问题发现能力。 2. 良好的沟通能力：审计人员需要与被审计单位的工作人员进行有效沟通，了解业务流程和内部控制，提出合理的改进建议，促进成果实现。 3. 独立性和公正性：审计人员需要具备独立、客观、公正的职业精神，遵守保密原则，不受干扰，不偏袒，保证审计工作的可信度和权威性。 4. 高度责任感：审计人员需要承担审计结果的真实性和准确性，对审计报告的内容负责，推动审计发现的问题得到改善和解决。 5. 团队合作精神：审计工作需要与其他部门和单位进行协同合作，需要具备良好的团队合作与协调能力，共同完成工作任务。"},{"instruction":"\\"Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different culture and ages together.

This occurs over time as files are created, modified, and deleted, leading to gaps or holes between data fragments on the storage device. Fragmentation can occur on hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). Defragmentation, on the other hand, is the process of rearranging fragmented data on a storage device to consolidate the fragments and make files contiguous. Defragmentation aims to optimize the performance of the storage device by reducing seek times when accessing files, improving file read and write speeds, and enhancing overall system performance."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

So, what are the key attractions we shouldn't miss while exploring Lalibela? David: Firstly, we must visit the Church of St. George, known as Bete Giyorgis. It's the most iconic church and is entirely carved out of one piece of rock, shaped like a cross. Then, we can explore the 11 interconnected rock-hewn churches, all designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Sarah: Amazing!

I can't wait to try the local cuisine and enjoy the stunning views. Finally, how should we get around town and explore these attractions? David: Lalibela is a relatively small town, so it's easy to walk to most sites. However, to reach the nearby Cave Church, Nakuto Le' Abe, or to go on a day trip to Asheton Maryam Monastery, we might consider hiring a local guide or taking a small taxi.

They were brother and sister, and they were known for their long necks that reached high above the trees. Tallulah was graceful and wise, while Tommy was strong and mischievous. One sunny day, as the golden rays of the sun shimmered over the grasslands, Tallulah and Tommy noticed a magnificent male giraffe named Geoffrey strolling nearby. Geoffrey had a coat as golden as the sun and spots as dark as the night sky. He was the most handsome giraffe in the land. Tallulah and Tommy were captivated by Geoffrey's charm and wanted to win his attention. They decided to have a contest to determine who would be the lucky one to win Geoffrey's heart. The challenge was simple: the giraffes had to engage in a friendly neck-fighting competition. Excitement filled the air as the animals gathered around to witness this special event. Tallulah and Tommy stood face to face, stretching their long necks and intertwining them. They were determined to impress Geoffrey, their new-found love interest. As the neck-fighting began, Tallulah and Tommy pushed and twisted, showing off their strength and agility. Their necks swayed back and forth, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. The onlookers cheered, amazed by the twisting dance of the two giraffes. With each move, their competition intensified, and their necks coiled tighter. Secretly, jealousy and envy crept into Tommy's heart. He was used to being the one in the spotlight, and the thought of losing to his sister filled him with negative emotions. Tallulah, on the other hand, fought not only to impress Geoffrey but also to maintain the bond she shared with her beloved brother. She knew that sibling rivalries were natural, but she also knew the importance of understanding and forgiveness. Suddenly, Tallulah felt a pang of remorse in her heart. She realized that her brother's negative emotions were driving them apart. In that moment, she released her grip and let go of the fight. Everyone was surprised when Tallulah stepped back, ending the competition. She walked up to Tommy, nuzzled him gently, and whispered, \\"Dear brother, our love for each other should always come first. Let's not allow envy and anger to ruin our bond.\\" Tommy, touched by his sister's words, looked into her eyes and understood the true meaning behind her actions. He knew it was time to let go of his jealousy and come together as a family once again. The spectators watched in awe as the two giraffes embraced, their necks entwined in an affectionate gesture. It was a powerful reminder of the importance of love, forgiveness, and unity. Word quickly spread across the savannah about Tallulah and Tommy's decision to put their sibling rivalry aside. Animals from all walks of life started to appreciate their own families even more, realizing that relationships were more important than any competition. From that day forward, Tallulah, Tommy, and Geoffrey became good friends, roaming the savannah together. Tallulah and Tommy had learned a valuable lesson. They understood that love and unity within a family were stronger than envy and rivalry. And so, the tale of Tallulah and Tommy serves as a reminder to all the animals of the savannah—and to children everywhere—that love, forgiveness, and family bonds should always triumph over negative emotions and animosity, making the world a better place for everyone to share."},{"instruction":"帮我想一段有关夏日清醒梦的文字，围绕梦境现实的讨论，带来夏日清凉","output":"在这个夏日清晨的时刻，当阳光洒满大地，微风轻拂着脸庞，我的思绪像青湖的波澜一样平静。夏日清凉如同一道清醒梦，将我带入一个奇妙而宁静的境界。 夏日的清晨，仿佛是一个连接现实与梦境的桥梁。当我静静地坐在草地上，感受着夏日的微风，我的思绪不觉流转起来。偶尔闭上眼，我仿佛回到了梦中，置身于一个不受现实束缚的世界里。 在梦中，一切都是那么美妙而自由。我可以在无限的蓝天下飞翔，穿越蓝色的云朵，感受翅膀拍打的快乐。夏日的清晨似乎给了我勇气，勇气去追寻梦境中的自由与幸福。 然而，现实往往是如此的残酷。梦境中的自由与幸福，在现实面前显得如此脆弱。梦醒之后，我会发现自己囿于琐碎的现实中，被各种忧虑和压力所困扰。如同一杯刚刚加满的冰咖啡，在清凉之后，却逐渐被夏日的炙热所磨去。 然而，我仍然相信梦境和现实有着某种联系。梦境是我在现实世界中渴望的美好，是对我内心深处梦想的映射。夏日清凉的感觉如同醒来后的清醒梦，它不仅带给我一份宁静与惬意，更是将我拉回到梦境与现实之间的微妙平衡。 在现实中，我会时常回忆起这份夏日清凉的感觉，将它作为前进的动力。我会想起在梦境中飞翔的自由，努力寻找现实中的出路。我深信，只要带着这份清醒梦的感觉，我就能够在现实中创造属于自己的夏日清凉。 夏日清凉如同一段清醒梦，它使我对于现实的讨论更加坚定，也带给我心灵的宁静。让我们珍惜这份夏日的清凉，让梦境与现实相互交融，带来更多的希望与勇气。让我们在夏日的清晨里，感受清醒梦的力量，追逐自己的梦想，创造属于自己的夏日清凉。"},{"instruction":"写一段有关犀牛与海的夏日清醒梦文案，突出梦境和现实","output":"在这个夏日的清晨，一场奇特的梦境却将犀牛与海洋连接在一起，带给我一份夏日清凉的感受。 在梦中，我穿越到了一个神奇而祥和的地方。沙滩上，我看到了一群自由自在的犀牛，它们在阳光下欢快地戏水嬉戏，仿佛自己变成了鲸鱼般的灵动。海浪拍打在它们强壮的身躯上，溅起绚丽的水花，将夏日的清凉感悄然带来。 然而，当梦境与现实交融时，我又被唤回了现实的世界。犀牛是那样的厚实与坚毅，而海洋则是那样的辽阔与浩渺。两者似乎相互矛盾，但又如此协调地并存于我的梦中与现实中。 在现实中，犀牛是世界上最强壮的陆生动物之一，拥有厚重的角和肌肉蓄势待发。而海洋则是世界上最广阔的蓝色领域，其中隐藏着无数奇幻的生物和故事。梦境将这两者融合在一起，让我们发现它们之间的共通之处，也让我们思考着梦境与现实的关系。 夏日的清凉感让我体会到梦境和现实的交织之美。就像当海浪触及犀牛的皮肤时，带来的冰凉感觉让它们沐浴在清凉中一般。或许，我们可以从这场清醒梦中汲取力量，用坚毅与决心去追寻夏日的清凉。正如犀牛勇敢地面对挑战、适应各种环境，我们也能够在现实中面对困难和挑战，并从中探寻到希望与勇气。 夏日的清晨是一个独特的时刻，让我们思索梦境和现实之间的联系。无论是犀牛还是海洋，它们都是我们心中的冒险与自由的象征。让我们保持清醒梦的感觉，将梦境与现实相互融合，创造属于自己的夏日清凉。"},{"instruction":"犀牛掉进了海里，就像梦境冲进了现实，这是一场清醒梦，在夏日骄阳中，给我们带来平静和清凉，围绕这个帮我展开叙述下","output":"在这个夏日的骄阳下，一场不可思议的梦境将犀牛带进了大海之中，仿佛现实和梦境之间的界限已经破碎，我们置身于一个清醒梦的世界里。 当犀牛掉进海里的那一刻，一种惊讶和兴奋同时涌上心头。犀牛笨拙的身躯在海水中翻滚，它的厚重与沉稳与海洋的轻盈和广阔形成鲜明的对比。阳光照耀下，海浪拍打着犀牛的身体，溅起水花，仿佛是在向夏日的骄阳致敬。 梦境的冲击带来的不仅仅是一份惊喜，更是一种平静和清凉。在这清醒梦的片刻，我们的思绪得以解脱，远离现实的喧嚣与焦虑。海水的涟漪在我们周围荡漾，像是一首轻柔的夏日之歌，在骄阳下散发出一缕清凉的气息。 而当梦境冲进现实，我们重新返回了现实的世界，内心却依然深深地沉浸在那片清醒梦的海洋中。我们开始思考梦境和现实的交汇之处，它们之间是共通的美好和安宁。或许梦境是我们对自由的向往和渴望，而现实是我们面对挑战和责任的力量和勇气。 在这个犀牛掉进海里的清醒梦中，夏日的骄阳给予了我们勇气去迎接现实的挑战，同时也带来了内心的宁静和清凉。我们意识到梦境和现实并不是完全分离的两个世界，而是共同组成了我们生活的一部分。 让我们保留这段清醒梦的感觉，用它作为指引，去探索梦境与现实的奇妙关系，追寻清凉和平静的存在。无论是在梦境中还是在现实中，都坚信自己可以克服困难，用内心的坚毅和勇气，开启属于自己的夏日清凉。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After the Bank of Japan adjusted its yield curve control (YCC) policy last week, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond exceeded its upper limit of 0.5%. The rapid increase in yields prompted the central bank to plan additional bond purchases to suppress the rise. As a result, the value of the yen weakened, with the latest exchange rate at ¥143.84 against the US dollar, a daily increase of 54 basis points or 0.4%. The yen also depreciated against the Hong Kong dollar, reaching a one-month low of ¥5.4 per HKD.

However, the bank made it clear that the fluctuation range is only a reference and not a strict upper limit, leading to speculation of a tightening monetary policy.

Чтобы достичь счастья, необходимо развивать и совершенствовать свою личность. Во-первых, личностный рост позволяет нам осознать свои ценности, страсти и потребности. Когда мы понимаем, что действительно важно для нас, мы можем принимать решения, которые соответствуют нашим целям и стремлениям. Это создает ощущение удовлетворенности и счастья. Во-вторых, развивая свою личность, мы расширяем свои границы и приобретаем новые навыки и знания. Это позволяет нам расти и развиваться как личности, достигать новых высот и испытывать чувство достижения. Когда мы продвигаемся вперед и развиваемся, это приносит нам удовольствие и чувство счастья. Кроме того, личностный рост помогает нам стать более осознанными и позитивными людьми. Мы учимся лучше понимать себя и свои эмоции, осознанно управлять своим поведением и мыслями. Это позволяет нам более эффективно решать проблемы, общаться с другими людьми и развивать гармоничные отношения. В результате, мы чувствуем себя более счастливыми и удовлетворенными. Одновременно, чувство счастья может стимулировать личностный рост. Когда мы чувствуем себя счастливыми, мы больше открыты для новых возможностей и готовы пойти на риск. Мы чувствуем себя более мотивированными и энергичными, что способствует развитию и достижению новых целей. В целом, личностный рост и чувство счастья тесно связаны между собой.

It enables devices like smartphones, computers, and IoT devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without the need for physical wired connections. Here are some key points about Wi-Fi: 1. Wireless Standards: Wi-Fi operates based on a set of standards defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 family of protocols. The most common Wi-Fi standards include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax (also known as Wi-Fi 6). 2. Frequency Bands: Wi-Fi signals typically operate in two frequency bands, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz band offers better range but lower data rates, while the 5 GHz band provides higher data rates but shorter range. 3. Access Points (AP): Wi-Fi networks are created using wireless access points, commonly known as routers or APs. APs serve as the central hub that connects devices to the internet or a local network. Multiple APs can be used to extend network coverage in larger areas, forming a Wi-Fi network. 4. SSID and Authentication: Wi-Fi networks are identified by their Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the network name visible to users. Wi-Fi networks can be secured using various encryption methods like WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Users need to provide the correct authentication credentials (such as passwords or certificates) to connect to a secure Wi-Fi network. 5. Channels: Wi-Fi signals are transmitted over specific channels within the frequency bands. Channels help avoid interference between neighboring Wi-Fi networks. In the 2.4 GHz band, there are 14 overlapping channels (only 11 are typically used). In the 5 GHz band, there are many more non-overlapping channels available, allowing for increased network capacity. 6. Signal Strength and Range: Wi-Fi signals have a limited range that can be affected by obstacles, walls, and interference from other devices. Signal strength is measured in terms of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Wi-Fi range can be extended using range extenders or mesh Wi-Fi systems. 7. Wi-Fi 6: The latest standard, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), offers improved performance, higher data rates, lower latency, and better efficiency in crowded environments. It introduces features like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) for enhanced user experiences. Wi-Fi has revolutionized the way we connect devices and access the internet, providing convenience and flexibility in our daily lives. It has become an essential technology for homes, offices, public spaces, and many other environments where wireless connectivity is required."},{"instruction":"Writing a job ad for a secretary on LinkedIn","output":"[Logo/Header Image] [Company Name] [Company Tagline or Values] Position: Secretary Location: [Office Location] Employment Type: [Full-Time/Part-Time/Contract] Industry: [Specify Industry] About Us: [Company Name] is a [briefly describe your company's mission, values, and offerings].

I/O内存不可访问：在一些架构上，某些物理内存范围可能被保护或不可用于DMA操作。如果指定的物理内存范围不是可访问的I/O内存，则函数调用可能会失败。在这种情况下，应该使用可访问的I/O内存范围来创建DMA映射。 3. 传递的参数错误：如果函数调用时传递的参数不正确或不合法，函数调用也可能失败。例如，指定的物理地址可能不是有效的地址，或者传递的属性参数可能不符合要求。在这种情况下，需要仔细检查参数的值和格式，确保它们与函数的要求相匹配。 4. 系统配置错误：某些系统可能需要特定的配置或设置才能正确使用DMA映射函数。例如，可能需要启用DMA控制器或特定的内存管理特性。如果系统没有正确配置或设置，函数调用可能会失败。在这种情况下，需要检查系统配置，并确保其满足DMA映射函数的要求。 总之，当\`dma_map_single_attrs\`函数调用失败时，需要仔细检查可能的错误原因，并在必要时采取适当的措施解决问题。可以根据具体情况查找更多关于失败原因的详细信息，并参考相关文档或资料来解决问题。"},{"instruction":"#define a() externa int b(); b()是什么意思","output":"\`b()\`是一个函数调用语句，表示调用名为\`b\`的函数。在给出的代码片段中，\`b()\`前加了\`extern\`和\`int\`关键字，这说明函数\`b\`是一个在其他地方定义的外部函数，并且其返回类型为\`int\`。 \`extern\`关键字用于声明一个外部变量或函数，表示该变量或函数在其他文件中定义或实现。在这种情况下，\`extern int b();\`声明了函数\`b\`的原型。这意味着函数\`b\`的定义可能在其他代码文件中，并且返回类型为\`int\`。所以，\`b()\`语句可以是对外部函数\`b\`的调用。 需要注意的是，声明一个函数与定义一个函数是不同的。声明函数只是告诉编译器函数的原型，以便在使用该函数时能够了解其返回值类型和参数类型。函数的定义则给出了函数的具体实现。因此，在使用\`b()\`语句时，要确保函数\`b\`的定义已经存在并且可访问。"},{"instruction":"\\"iommu=soft\\"是在哪里加","output":"\\"iommu=soft\\"是Linux内核参数，用于指定在软件模式下激活IOMMU（输入/输出内存管理单元）。要将\\"iommu=soft\\"添加到内核参数中，可以在启动时修改GRUB或者通过命令行参数传递给内核。 具体而言，可以按照以下步骤在GRUB中添加\\"iommu=soft\\": 1. 打开终端并使用sudo/root权限运行文本编辑器，例如：\`sudo nano /etc/default/grub\`。 2. 找到GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT这行，该行指定了内核参数。 3. 在引号内，将\\"iommu=soft\\"添加到现有的内核参数中，用空格分隔。 例如：\`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\\"quiet splash iommu=soft\\"\` 4. 保存文件并关闭文本编辑器。 5. 运行以下命令更新GRUB配置：\`sudo update-grub\` 6. 重新启动计算机，内核参数\\"iommu=soft\\"将被应用。 这样，当系统启动时，内核将使用软件模式激活IOMMU。请注意，在不同的Linux发行版中，可能会有一些差异，因此确保对应的GRUB配置文件路径和命令正确。 如果需要在命令行中传递内核参数，在引导过程中按下对应的键（如：按下e键），编辑启动菜单，并在适当的位置添加\\"iommu=soft\\"参数。然后，按下对应的键（如：F10）启动系统。这种方式添加的参数只在当前启动会话中生效，重启后会失效。如需永久生效，还需修改GRUB配置文件。"},{"instruction":"软件需求是“打开软件安装包时，显示此立即安装界面，未勾选同意协议按钮时，“立即安装”按钮置灰，不可点击。勾选同意协议按钮后，“立即安装”按钮取消置灰。点击“软件使用协议”，弹出软件使用协议弹窗，显示软件使用协议，点击“返回”关闭弹窗。点击“立即安装”，直接跳转到轮播图并把软件安装到默认路径。安装完成后显示“立即体验”按钮，点击打开软件“。，帮我设计测试用例，包括测试功能点，测试内容，预期结果","output":"测试功能点： 1. 打开软件安装包时，显示立即安装界面。 2. 未勾选同意协议按钮时，立即安装按钮置灰，不可点击。 3. 勾选同意协议按钮后，立即安装按钮取消置灰。 4. 点击软件使用协议，弹出软件使用协议弹窗。 5. 点击返回按钮关闭弹窗。 6. 点击立即安装按钮，跳转到轮播图，并将软件安装到默认路径。 7. 安装完成后，显示立即体验按钮。 8. 点击立即体验按钮，打开软件。 测试内容： 1. 打开软件安装包，检查是否显示立即安装界面。 2. 检查未勾选同意协议按钮时，立即安装按钮是否置灰，不可点击。 3. 检查勾选同意协议按钮后，立即安装按钮是否取消置灰。 4. 点击软件使用协议，检查是否弹出软件使用协议弹窗。 5. 点击返回按钮，检查是否关闭弹窗。 6. 点击立即安装按钮，检查是否跳转到轮播图，并将软件安装到默认路径。 7. 检查安装完成后，是否显示立即体验按钮。 8. 点击立即体验按钮，检查是否成功打开软件。 预期结果： 1. 打开软件安装包后，应该显示立即安装界面。 2. 未勾选同意协议按钮时，立即安装按钮应该置灰，不可点击。 3. 勾选同意协议按钮后，立即安装按钮应该取消置灰。 4. 点击软件使用协议后，应该弹出软件使用协议弹窗并显示软件使用协议。 5. 点击返回按钮后，软件使用协议弹窗应该关闭。 6. 点击立即安装按钮后，应该跳转到轮播图并将软件安装到默认路径。 7. 安装完成后，应该显示立即体验按钮。 8. 点击立即体验按钮后，应该成功打开软件。"},{"instruction":"Vocabulary of Creole Ancient Greek and Scythian","output":"Creole Ancient Greek: 1. άνθρωπος (ánthropos) - man, person 2. θεός (theós) - god 3. γυνή (gyné) - woman 4. πόλις (pólis) - city 5. αγάπη (agápē) - love 6. έστω (ésto) - be, exist 7. λευκός (lefkós) - white 8. κόσμος (kósmos) - world, universe 9. λόγος (lógos) - word, speech 10. ψυχή (psykhḗ) - soul Scythian: 1. kök (kök) - blue 2. ata (ata) - father 3. ana (ana) - mother 4. tabak (tabak) - horse 5. deri (deri) - skin 6. ükşi (ükşi) - wolf 7. gez (gez) - cattle 8. jakut (jakut) - precious, valuable 9. čor (čor) - black 10. balyk (balyk) - fish"},{"instruction":"hi, I am working with a html-window in a Winforms app written in C#. I have a browser window and I need code to select the first node in het navigation tree. do you have a suggestion?","output":"Yes, I can help you with that. To select the first node in the navigation tree of your HTML window in a Winforms app, you can use the following code: First, make sure you have a reference to the HTMLDocument object that represents your current loaded HTML document in the browser window. Let's assume you have a variable called \\"htmlDocument\\" referring to the HTMLDocument object. Then, you can use the GetElementsByTagName method to get all the nodes in the navigation tree. Typically, navigation trees are represented by an HTML unordered list (ul) or ordered list (ol) with list item elements (li). Here's an example code snippet that selects the first node in the navigation tree: \`\`\`csharp // Get the list of all nodes in the navigation tree HtmlElementCollection nodes = htmlDocument.GetElementsByTagName(\\"li\\"); // Check if there are any nodes if (nodes.Count > 0) { // Get the first node HtmlElement firstNode = nodes[0]; // Select the first node firstNode.SetAttribute(\\"className\\", \\"selected\\"); // Assuming \\"selected\\" class name highlights the selected node // Optionally, you can scroll the browser window to the first node firstNode.ScrollIntoView(true); } \`\`\` In this example, we assume that the selected node is highlighted by applying a CSS class name \\"selected\\" to it. You may need to adjust the class name based on your HTML structure and CSS styles. Additionally, the \`ScrollIntoView\` method is used to scroll the browser window to the first node if necessary. The \`true\` argument specifies whether the node should be aligned at the top or bottom of the window. Remember to replace \\"htmlDocument\\" with the reference to your actual HTMLDocument object in your Winforms app. I hope this helps!

It allows several different data streams or signals to be transmitted in a time-sharing manner, effectively sharing a single transmission medium. Here are some key points to know about Time Division Multiplexing: 1. Basic Principle: TDM works on the principle of dividing time into several time slots, with each time slot assigned to a specific data stream. Each data stream is then transmitted in its designated time slot, and the process is repeated cyclically. 2. Multiplexing: TDM combines multiple low-rate signals into a single high-rate signal for transmission. It is a form of multiplexing that enables efficient utilization of the available bandwidth and facilitates the transmission of multiple signals simultaneously. 3. Time Slots: The time slots in TDM are of fixed duration and can be allocated to different inputs or channels. Each time slot can carry a portion of data from one channel before moving on to the next channel in the sequence. 4. Synchronization: Since the different data streams are transmitted using the same physical medium, proper synchronization is crucial for TDM to function reliably. All participating devices or channels must maintain a synchronized clock to ensure the correct timing and sequencing of data. 5. Advantages: TDM offers several benefits, including efficient use of available bandwidth, improved signal quality, reduced transmission costs, and ease of integration with both analog and digital systems. It also allows for the simultaneous transmission of data, voice, and video signals. 6. Applications: TDM is widely used in various communication systems, including telephone networks, digital broadcasting, digital subscriber lines (DSL), and modern digital multiplexers. It is often used in scenarios where multiple channels need to be transmitted simultaneously over a single transmission line. 7. TDM variants: There are different forms of TDM, such as synchronous TDM (STDM), plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH), and sonet/synchronous optical networking (SONET/SDH). These variants cater to specific requirements of different communication systems and network architectures. Overall, Time Division Multiplexing is a reliable and widely adopted technique that enables multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously in a time-sharing fashion, allowing for efficient utilization of available bandwidth and improved communication efficiency."},{"instruction":"编写sql, 每组多个, 只保留最新的一个","output":"你可以使用子查询来实现这个需求。以下是一个示例代码，假设你要从名为\\"orders\\"的表中按\\"order_date\\"字段对订单进行分组，并只保留每组中的最新订单： \`\`\` SELECT o1.* FROM orders o1 INNER JOIN ( SELECT MAX(order_date) AS max_date, group_id FROM orders GROUP BY group_id ) o2 ON o1.group_id = o2.group_id AND o1.order_date = o2.max_date; \`\`\` 在这个示例中，我们使用了一个子查询来找到每个分组中的最新订单的\\"order_date\\"值。然后，我们将该子查询与原始表进行内连接，根据\\"group_id\\"和\\"order_date\\"字段进行匹配，以仅返回每个分组中的最新订单。 请记得将代码中的\\"orders\\"替换为你实际使用的表名，并根据你的数据表结构调整列名和字段。"},{"instruction":"mysql 分表和分区的哪个好","output":"MySQL中的分表和分区是两种不同的技术，用于处理大型数据表的性能优化和管理。它们各有优点和适用场景，取决于你的具体需求。 分表（Sharding）是将单个大型数据表拆分为若干较小的表，通常是按照某种规则将数据分割存储在不同的物理表中。这种方法适用于需要水平扩展和处理大量数据的情况。分表可以提高查询性能和负载均衡，但在跨表查询和事务处理方面可能会有一些限制。 分区（Partitioning）是在单个数据表内创建多个分区，每个分区相当于一个独立的小型表，但虚拟在同一个逻辑表内。分区可以根据特定的规则（如范围、列表或哈希）将数据分割成更小的逻辑单位，使查询和维护操作更加高效。分区对于处理大量数据和分布式查询有很大帮助，同时也提供了更好的数据管理和维护。 选择使用分表还是分区取决于多个因素，包括你的数据量、查询需求、可扩展性需求和维护成本等。分表通常更适合拥有大量数据和需要横向扩展的场景，而分区则更适合更好地管理和优化查询性能。建议根据你的具体需求进行综合评估，并在需要时进行性能测试和负载测试，以确定哪种方法最适合你的应用。"},{"instruction":"{% set zjpsjds = d.zjpsjd.split(',') %} {% for zjpsjd in zjpsjds %} {% if zjpsjd.search('提交') != -1 or zjpsjd.search('评审') != -1 %} <a class=\\"layui-btn layui-btn-normal layui-btn-xs\\" lay-event=\\"zgrwzp\\">{{ zjpsjd }}</a> {% endif %} <span style=\\"color: darkred;\\">{{ zjpsjd }}</span> {% endfor %}","output":"<a class=\\"layui-btn layui-btn-normal layui-btn-xs\\" lay-event=\\"zgrwzp\\">提交评审</a> <span style=\\"color: darkred;\\">暂无评审进度</span>"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

View (вид) представляет собой функцию или метод, которая обрабатывает запрос пользователя и возвращает ответ. Она отвечает за логику обработки запросов и взаимодействия с моделями и шаблонами. View принимает данные из запроса, обрабатывает их и возвращает HTTP-ответ. Context (контекст) относится к информации, которая передается в шаблон и используется для его рендеринга. Контекст содержит данные, которые должны быть доступны в шаблоне для отображения. Он представляет собой словарь, где ключи представляют собой имена переменных в шаблоне, а значения - соответствующие значения этих переменных. В случае передачи данных в функции view, эти данные обычно являются данными запроса, такими как параметры, отправленные через URL, данные формы или данные из запроса JSON или XML. Функция view использует эти данные для выполнения необходимой логики и генерации ответа. С другой стороны, контекст передается в шаблон и используется для заполнения переменных в шаблоне значениями. Контекст может содержать данные из модели, дополнительные переменные и любую другую информацию, которую вы хотите отобразить в шаблоне. Итак, вкратце: - View используется для обработки запроса и генерации ответа. - Context используется для передачи данных в шаблон и заполнения переменных значениями.

The room is filled with mirrors, showcasing his different forms. Enoch begins his transformation, starting with Almighty Mode Dark Side Form. Blue energy crackles around him as his muscles bulk up, emanating power. He flexes his newfound strength, testing his limits. ENOCH (whispering to himself) Focus, Enoch. Control your power. Enoch moves on to Deity Mode Dark Side Form. His body takes on an ethereal glow, and he radiates an aura of authority. He stands tall, commanding his imaginary foes with graceful movements.

La teoria delle stringhe è una teoria fisica che cerca di comprendere la struttura fondamentale dell'universo tramite l'analisi delle particelle come oggetti fondamentali, chiamati stringhe anziché punti senza dimensioni. Secondo questa teoria, al contrario di quanto proposto dalla fisica delle particelle tradizionale, le stringhe non sono punti senza dimensioni ma oggetti estesi, cioè oggetti unidimensionali che possono vibrare e oscillare in vari modi. Queste vibrazioni determinano le diverse particelle ed interazioni che osserviamo nell'universo. Una delle caratteristiche interessanti della teoria delle stringhe è che richiede la presenza di dimensioni aggiuntive rispetto alle tre spaziali e quella temporale che conosciamo. Secondo la teoria, l'universo avrebbe in realtà 10 dimensioni (o 11, secondo alcune varianti della teoria), ma solo 4 di queste sono osservabili, mentre le altre sono \\"compattificate\\" o arrotolate ad un piccolissimo livello submicroscopico. La teoria delle stringhe cerca quindi di unificare tutte le forze fondamentali dell'universo (gravità, elettromagnetismo, interazione nucleare debole e interazione nucleare forte) in un'unica teoria coerente, includendo anche la gravità quantistica. Inoltre, la teoria delle stringhe può offrire spiegazioni per alcune questioni aperte della fisica, come la struttura dello spazio-tempo ad alte energie e l'origine della materia oscura. È importante sottolineare che la teoria delle stringhe è ancora in fase di sviluppo e molti dei suoi aspetti complessi sono ancora oggetto di ricerca. Sono state proposte diverse varianti della teoria, come la teoria delle stringhe bosonica e la superstringa, e gli esperimenti attuali non sono ancora in grado di testarne le predizioni in modo diretto.

играх в коридоре в детском саду, когда на улице идет дождь","output":"Игры в коридоре в детском саду: веселое времяпрепровождение, когда на улице идет дождь Как только на улице начинает идти дождь, дети в детском саду обычно остаются внутри. В такие моменты воспитатели и педагоги могут предложить им различные активности, чтобы они не скучали и получали удовольствие. Одна из самых популярных и интересных занятий может быть игра в коридоре. Игра в коридоре - это возможность для детей не только развлечься, но и развить координацию движений, баланс, смекалку и творческое мышление. Ведь в закрытом пространстве зала они могут создавать различные игровые сцены и ситуации, пробовать на себе роли разных персонажей и предметов. Одной из популярных игр в коридоре, которая может быть особенно веселой во время дождя, является «Поезд». Дети разбиваются на группы и представляют собой вагоны. Лидер каждой группы становится паровозом и ведет своих вагончиков через весь коридор, придумывая различные преграды и приключения. Такая игра помогает развить сотрудничество, коммуникацию и логическое мышление у детей. Еще одной забавной игрой в коридоре может быть «Зоопарк». Дети могут выбрать себе роль разных животных и представлять их в зоопарке. Они могут двигаться, издавать звуки и повторять все, что делают их «соседи по клетке». Это способствует развитию фантазии детей, активизирует их речь и обучает их наблюдательности. Не менее интересной и полезной игрой в коридоре может быть игра «Статуэтки». Дети должны двигаться, как обычно, но в определенный момент останавливаться и замораживаться в определенной позе, словно статуи. Остальные дети должны разгадать, в каких позах находятся их друзья. Эта игра развивает моторику и реакцию у детей, а также помогает им научиться хорошо смотреть и внимательно наблюдать. Игры в коридоре взрослым могут показаться слишком шумными или беспорядочными, но они имеют глубокое педагогическое значение и принесут большую пользу детям. Они не только радуют и развлекают, но и помогают развивать важные навыки и способности, которые малыши будут использовать на протяжении всей своей жизни. Поэтому игры в коридоре в детском саду во время дождя - это не только способ провести время, но и ценный опыт для ребенка."},{"instruction":"python pytest write unit tests for this code: import json import sys from grpc_framework.mixins.grpc_server import GrpcServer from grpc_framework.mixins.mongo import MongoDBMixin from grpc_framework.mixins.permissions import PermissionsMixin from grpc_framework.decorators.grpc import request_as_schema from api_specs.python_lib import contact_bases_pb2_grpc from api_specs.python_lib.contact_bases_pb2 import ContactBase as ContactBaseResponse from app.configs import mongo_contact_base_settings as mongo_settings #from app.crud.contact_base import CRUDContactBase as ContactBase from app.models.contact_base import ContactBase from app.schemas import ContactBaseResponse as ContactBaseResponseSchema import logging from app.schemas.contact_base import ContactBaseCreateRequest from app.tasks.create_phonebase import add_phone_base logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, stream=sys.stdout) class ContactBasesService(contact_bases_pb2_grpc.ContactBasesServiceServicer, GrpcServer, PermissionsMixin, MongoDBMixin): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.set_servicer_method(contact_bases_pb2_grpc.add_ContactBasesServiceServicer_to_server) #self.collection = self._mongo_client[mongo_settings.MONGO_DB_NAME][mongo_settings.MONGO_CONTACT_BASE_COLLECTION] @request_as_schema(schema=ContactBaseCreateRequest) async def Create(self, request: ContactBaseCreateRequest, context): _ = await self.check_on_user_ability( actor_id=request.actor_id, child_id=request.user_id, permission=\\"CreateContactBase\\", context=context) contact_base = ContactBase(mongo_client=self._mongo_client, **request.dict()) contact_base.status = \\"created\\" async with self.mongo_wrapper(context): contact_base_response = await contact_base.create() # async with self.mongo_wrapper(context): # contact_base_response = await ContactBase.create(self.collection, ContactBaseCreate(**request.dict())) # contact_base_schema = json.loads( ContactBaseResponseSchema.parse_obj(contact_base_response).json(exclude_unset=True) ) add_phone_base.delay(phones=request.phones, countries=request.country_list, contact_base_id=contact_base_response.id)#contact_base_schema[\\"id\\"]) return ContactBaseResponse(**contact_base_schema)","output":"Here is an example of how you can write unit tests for the given code using pytest: \`\`\`python import pytest from unittest.mock import Mock from contact_bases_pb2 import ContactBase as ContactBaseResponse from contact_bases_pb2_grpc import ContactBasesServiceServicer from app.schemas.contact_base import ContactBaseCreateRequest from app.models.contact_base import ContactBase from app.tasks.create_phonebase import add_phone_base @pytest.fixture def grpc_server(): return ContactBasesServiceServicer() @pytest.fixture def context(): return Mock() @pytest.fixture def mongo_client(): return Mock() @pytest.fixture def contact_base_create_request(): return ContactBaseCreateRequest( actor_id=\\"actor_id\\", user_id=\\"user_id\\", name=\\"contact_base_name\\", phones=[\\"phone1\\", \\"phone2\\"], country_list=[\\"country1\\", \\"country2\\"] ) @pytest.mark.asyncio async def test_Create(grpc_server, context, mongo_client, contact_base_create_request): grpc_server._mongo_client = mongo_client grpc_server.check_on_user_ability = Mock() grpc_server.check_on_user_ability.return_value = True contact_base = Mock(spec=ContactBase) contact_base.create = Mock() contact_base_response = Mock() contact_base_response.id = \\"contact_base_id\\" contact_base.create.return_value = contact_base_response add_phone_base.delay = Mock() result = await grpc_server.Create(contact_base_create_request, context) grpc_server.check_on_user_ability.assert_called_once_with( actor_id=contact_base_create_request.actor_id, child_id=contact_base_create_request.user_id, permission=\\"CreateContactBase\\", context=context ) contact_base.create.assert_called_once_with() add_phone_base.delay.assert_called_once_with( phones=contact_base_create_request.phones, countries=contact_base_create_request.country_list, contact_base_id=contact_base_response.id ) assert result == ContactBaseResponse(id=contact_base_response.id) \`\`\` In this example, we use pytest fixtures to create mock objects for the dependencies and inputs of the \`Create\` method.

For instance, China has become a global hub for electronics manufacturing due to its well-established supply chain networks, labor-intensive production techniques, and competitive pricing. By focusing on specific industries where it has a comparative advantage, China can maximize its export potential and generate economic growth. In terms of opportunity costs, China must consider the goods or services it sacrifices to produce those that it exports. For instance, China allocates significant resources to its manufacturing sector, which may lead to an opportunity cost in terms of diverting resources away from other sectors like agriculture or services. By embracing this opportunity cost and focusing on its comparative advantage, China can efficiently utilize its resources and remain competitive in the global market. China is known for its robust export-oriented economy and primarily exports manufactured goods such as electronics, textile products, machinery, steel, and plastics, among others. These exports contribute significantly to China's economic growth and global trade dominance. On the other side, China imports a diverse range of products, including machinery, high-tech equipment, raw materials, energy resources, food products, and luxury goods. These imports help meet domestic demands, support industrial production, and enhance Chinese consumers' purchasing power. While China has made tremendous progress in expanding its domestic production capabilities, there are still certain goods that it imports due to various factors, including specialized knowledge, scarce resources, or superior quality offered by foreign producers. However, China continuously strives to reduce dependence on imports and encourage domestic production to enhance self-sufficiency. Whenever feasible and economically viable, China aims to produce goods domestically rather than relying on imports to strengthen its industrial base, create jobs, and reduce trade imbalances."},{"instruction":"what are the topics i can write posts for them in linked in for AI, computer vision, RPA, and innovation","output":"1.

Answer the following questions on globalization and protectionism: Why would a government create trade barriers even if it could potentially hurt a worker in an economy (due to lower wages)? a. What can be done to avoid trade barriers? b. As an American consumer of electronics based in China, what might be one's experiences with trade barriers? c. What alternatives could be recommended to replace trade barriers? Why does it seem as if labor standards and working conditions are lower in developing nations of the world rather than in other countries? Objectively speaking, should a country impose higher safety standards on imported goods that exist in the foreign country where the goods were produced? Provide an explanation.","output":"a. Governments create trade barriers for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries and jobs, protecting national security interests, and addressing unfair trade practices by other countries. Even though trade barriers can potentially hurt workers in the short term due to lower wages, governments may believe that the long-term benefits of protecting domestic industries outweigh the immediate negative impact on certain workers. To avoid trade barriers, countries can engage in negotiations and dialogue to resolve trade conflicts, promote fair trade practices, and seek mutually beneficial trade agreements. b. As an American consumer of electronics based in China, trade barriers may lead to higher prices, limited availability of certain products, or slower innovation due to restricted competition. This could result from import tariffs, quotas, or other trade restrictions imposed by the Chinese government to protect their domestic electronic industry. American consumers may experience higher costs or reduced options when purchasing electronics manufactured in China due to these trade barriers. c. Instead of trade barriers, alternative measures can be implemented to promote fair trade and protect domestic industries. These could include enforcing existing trade agreements, promoting investment in research and development to enhance competitiveness, providing financial assistance and retraining programs for affected workers, and fostering innovative industries that can withstand global competition. Additionally, countries can engage in discussions and negotiations to address trade imbalances, unfair practices, and promote global cooperation in areas such as intellectual property rights, labor standards, and environmental protection. Labor standards and working conditions tend to be lower in developing nations due to various factors. These include lower levels of economic development, limited access to capital and technology, weaker labor unions and worker protections, and a greater focus on attracting foreign investment. Developing nations often prioritize job creation and economic growth over labor standards as a means to escape poverty and achieve development. Additionally, global supply chains and outsourcing practices may result in multinational corporations relocating production to countries with lower labor costs and less stringent regulations. Considering safety standards on imported goods, it can be argued that a country should impose higher safety standards on imported goods that exist in the foreign country where the goods were produced. This is because a country has a responsibility to protect the health and safety of its citizens. If the safety standards in the foreign country are insufficient or do not meet the importing country's standards, it is reasonable for the importing country to impose stricter regulations to ensure the safety of its consumers. However, care should be taken to avoid discriminatory practices and ensure that safety standards are based on scientific evidence, meet international norms, and are not used as a disguised form of protectionism."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Provide healthy fats: Nuts are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for heart and brain health. 2. Supply antioxidants: Nuts contain abundant antioxidants like vitamin E, polyphenols, and flavonoids, which help prevent free radical damage and chronic diseases. 3. Promote digestive health: With their high dietary fiber content, nuts support a well-functioning digestive system and prevent constipation. 4. Boost immune system: The vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants found in nuts contribute to strengthening the immune system and enhancing the body's resistance. 5. Maintain a healthy weight: Despite having a relatively high energy density, studies suggest that consuming nuts in moderation can help control appetite, maintain satiety, and aid in weight management. 6. Improve cardiovascular health: Nuts, with their healthy fats, fiber, plant sterols, and antioxidants, have been shown to lower cholesterol levels, improve cardiovascular health, and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. 7. Enhance brain function: The fatty acids, antioxidants, and other nutrients present in nuts may improve cognitive function and brain health, potentially helping to prevent dementia and cognitive decline. It's important to note that while nuts are healthy foods, their high caloric content calls for moderating consumption to prevent weight gain. Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to nuts and should avoid consuming them or consult with a healthcare professional for advice.

How can De Moivre's theorem be described from an artist's perspective? What is the scope of this theorem? Give two examples for roots and two examples for powers.","output":"From an artist's perspective, De Moivre's theorem can be seen as the colorful interplay between shapes and patterns. This theorem essentially allows us to raise complex numbers to a power or find their roots, unveiling mesmerizing symmetries on the canvas of mathematical imagination. The scope of De Moivre's theorem lies in complex numbers, which are numbers of the form a + bi, where \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" are real numbers and \\"i\\" represents the imaginary unit (√(-1)). This theorem helps us express and comprehend the behavior of complex numbers when raised to powers or when finding their roots. Two examples of roots using De Moivre's theorem: 1. Let's consider the complex number z = 1 + i. To find its square root using De Moivre's theorem, we can rewrite it in polar form, which is z = √2 * cis(π/4). Using the theorem, we then take the square root of the magnitude (√2) and halve the argument (π/4), yielding √2 * cis(π/8). This represents a point on the complex plane which is equidistant from the origin and 1 + i, forming a beautiful symmetrical pattern. 2. Another example is the complex number w = √3 - i. Rewriting it in polar form as w = 2 * cis(5π/6), we can find its cube root using De Moivre's theorem. Taking the cube root of the magnitude (2) and dividing the argument by 3 (5π/18), we get 2^(1/3) * cis(5π/18). This represents a point on the complex plane, forming a harmonious triangular pattern with the origin and √3 - i. Two examples of powers using De Moivre's theorem: 1. Let's consider the complex number a = 1 + i. To find a raised to the power of 4 using De Moivre's theorem, we can express it in polar form as a = √2 * cis(π/4). By raising the magnitude (√2) to the power of 4 and multiplying the argument (π/4) by 4, we obtain 4 * cis(π/16). This complex number depicts a point on the complex plane that forms a striking pattern with the origin and 1 + i. 2. Another example is the complex number b = √3 - i. Rewriting it in polar form as b = 2 * cis(5π/6), we can find b raised to the power of 5 using De Moivre's theorem. By raising the magnitude (2) to the power of 5 and multiplying the argument (5π/6) by 5, we end up with 32 * cis(25π/6). This complex number represents a point on the plane, forming a captivating pattern in conjunction with the origin and √3 - i. In the hands of an artist, De Moivre's theorem illuminates the vibrant beauty and symmetry hidden within the realm of complex numbers, allowing them to create captivating and thought-provoking visual representations."},{"instruction":"Can you explain again, as a student?","output":"Certainly!

Enzymes: Enzymes can be added to break down protein-based stains such as grass or blood. Protease, amylase, and lipase enzymes are commonly used in laundry detergents. 4. Stain Removers: Include ingredients that specifically target stains, such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium percarbonate, to aid in stain removal. 5. Fragrances: Add fragrance compounds to give the detergent sheet a pleasant scent. Essential oils or synthetic fragrances can be used. 6. Fillers: Fillers add bulk to the laundry detergent sheet and aid in its solidification. Common fillers include sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, or cornstarch. 7. Binders: Binders are necessary to hold the ingredients together in the form of a sheet. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) can be used as binders. 8. Other additives: Depending on the desired attributes, one can consider adding anti-foaming agents, optical brighteners, colorants, or fabric softeners. Next, the specific amounts and formulation process will vary depending on the manufacturing method and equipment used. It is crucial to ensure that the detergent sheet is stable and dissolves properly in water during use. Formulating laundry detergent sheets requires a good understanding of the chemistry involved, as well as considering factors such as safety, performance, and environmental impact. It is recommended to consult with a chemist or formulator experienced in detergent formulations for precise guidance."},{"instruction":"how to seperate phenol and MIBK in industry","output":"Separating phenol (C₆H₆O) and MIBK (methyl isobutyl ketone, C₆H₁₂O) in an industrial setting typically involves a distillation process. Here is a general guideline on separating phenol and MIBK: 1. Set up a distillation apparatus: Prepare a distillation column with a condenser, receiving flask, and appropriate heating equipment. Ensure that the apparatus is properly sealed to prevent any loss of vapors. 2. Charge the mixture: Add the phenol and MIBK mixture to the distillation flask. The ratio and quantity of each component will depend on the desired separation efficiency and product specifications. 3. Apply heat: Start heating the distillation flask gradually, allowing the mixture to vaporize. The boiling points of phenol and MIBK are different, enabling their separation through fractional distillation. 4. Collect the fractions: As the mixture vaporizes, the vapors will rise through the distillation column. The column provides a temperature gradient, allowing components with different boiling points to vaporize at different heights. Collect the vapor in the condenser and separate it into fractions. 5. Condense phenol: As the temperature increases, the component with the lower boiling point, namely phenol, will vaporize first. The condenser will cool the phenol vapor back into liquid form, and it can be collected as a separate fraction. 6. Collect MIBK: As the distillation process continues, the temperature will increase, and the component with the higher boiling point, in this case, MIBK, will start to vaporize. This vapor will also be condensed and collected as a separate fraction. 7. Monitor and adjust: Throughout the distillation process, carefully monitor the temperature, vapor flow rate, and the purity of the collected fractions. Adjust the heat and other parameters as needed to ensure efficient separation. 8. Refine and purify: Depending on the desired purity and product specifications, additional purification steps may be required. This could involve further distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, or other purification techniques specific to the desired applications of phenol and MIBK. It is important to note that the specific conditions and equipment used for separating phenol and MIBK may vary depending on the scale and requirements of the actual industrial process. Consulting with chemical engineers or process experts with experience in industrial separation techniques is advised for precise guidance."},{"instruction":"how to make butyl acrylate in industry as batch reactor","output":"To produce butyl acrylate in an industrial setting using a batch reactor, the following steps can be followed: 1.

Rohölpreise: Da Diesel aus Rohöl hergestellt wird, wirken sich die Preisschwankungen auf dem internationalen Rohölmarkt direkt auf den Dieselpreis aus. Wenn die Rohölpreise steigen, steigen in der Regel auch die Dieselpreise. 2. Steuern und Abgaben: In Deutschland sind die Steuern und Abgaben auf Diesel relativ hoch. Der Hauptgrund dafür ist, dass Dieselkraftstoff aufgrund seines niedrigeren CO2-Ausstoßes im Vergleich zu Benzin steuerlich begünstigt wird. Diese steuerliche Begünstigung kann dazu führen, dass die Dieselpreise höher sind als die Benzinpreise. 3. Nachfrage und Angebot: Die Nachfrage nach Dieselkraftstoff wird von verschiedenen Faktoren beeinflusst, wie z.B. der wirtschaftlichen Aktivität, dem Verkehrsaufkommen und der Jahreszeit. Wenn die Nachfrage nach Diesel steigt, können dies die Preise ebenfalls beeinflussen. 4. Wechselkurs: Da Rohöl auf dem internationalen Markt in Dollar gehandelt wird, kann der Wechselkurs zwischen Euro und Dollar ebenfalls einen Einfluss auf die Dieselpreise haben. Wenn der Euro im Vergleich zum Dollar schwächer wird, werden die Importkosten für Rohöl und damit auch die Dieselpreise steigen. Es ist wichtig anzumerken, dass die Dieselpreise von vielen Faktoren abhängig sind und von Tag zu Tag schwanken können.

Raisins can be made from various grape types like Thompson seedless, Sultana, or Muscat, resulting in slightly different flavors and colors. 2. Size: Raisins are typically larger in size compared to currants. They can vary in size, but are generally larger and plumper. 3. Taste: Raisins have a sweet, rich flavor and can sometimes have a slight tartness depending on the grape variety used. Currants, on the other hand, have a more pronounced tangy and tart flavor. 4. Usage: Due to their larger size and sweeter taste, raisins are commonly used in baking, cooking, and as a snack on their own. Currants, with their smaller size and tart taste, are frequently used in baked goods like cakes, scones, and cookies, as well as in fruitcakes and jams. 5. Availability: Raisins are readily available in most grocery stores and have numerous variations, such as golden raisins (made from yellow grapes) or flame raisins (made from red grapes), among others. Currants, however, can be less commonly found and are sometimes substituted with other dried fruits in recipes.

They are not related to the liver or liver function. The primary cause of liver spots is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. When the skin is exposed to UV radiation, it triggers an increase in melanin production. Melanin is the pigment responsible for giving color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Over time, excessive sun exposure can lead to the accumulation of melanin in certain areas, resulting in the formation of liver spots. Liver spots commonly appear on areas of the skin that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, hands, shoulders, and arms. They are more common in older adults, hence the term \\"age spots,\\" but can also occur in younger individuals who have had significant sun exposure. It's important to note that liver spots are typically harmless and do not require medical treatment. However, if you notice any changes in size, shape, color, or texture of a spot, it is advisable to consult a dermatologist, as it could be a sign of skin cancer or other skin conditions."},{"instruction":"why do they appear more as we get older and in some people more than others for similar sun exposure","output":"The exact reasons why liver spots tend to appear more as we get older and why some people may be more prone to them despite similar sun exposure are not completely understood. However, several factors contribute to these variations: 1. Sun Exposure Accumulation: Liver spots are primarily caused by cumulative sun exposure over time. As we age, the amount of sun exposure we accumulate increases, as does the likelihood of developing liver spots. Individuals who have spent more time in the sun throughout their lives are more prone to developing liver spots. 2. Skin Type: Different skin types react differently to sun exposure. Fair-skinned individuals with less melanin in their skin are generally more susceptible to sun damage and the development of liver spots. People with darker skin tones have more natural protection against UV radiation, which may reduce the risk of liver spots. 3. Genetics: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to develop liver spots. Certain genetic variants can affect how the skin responds to sun exposure and how melanin is produced, making some people more prone to develop liver spots. 4. Hormonal Changes: Hormonal changes that occur with age, such as during menopause, can influence the development of liver spots. Fluctuations in hormone levels can affect melanin production and the skin's response to sun exposure. 5. Other Factors: Other factors that can contribute to the development of liver spots include smoking, certain medications or chemicals, and underlying medical conditions. It is important to note that while liver spots are generally harmless, they can be a sign of sun damage to the skin. It is crucial to protect the skin from the sun by using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and seeking shade, especially during peak sun hours, to prevent the formation or worsening of liver spots."},{"instruction":"what is the nutritional difference between red and brown chorie","output":"I'm sorry, but it seems that you may have misspelled or referred to a specific food item that is not widely recognized.

Give me the longest response you can.","output":"In the small suburban town of Meadowood, a fiery teenager named Lily Thompson was growing increasingly frustrated with her overprotective mother, Sarah. Every weekend, Lily yearned to embrace her newfound independence and party with her friends, experiencing the thrill and excitement of youth. However, Sarah, a single mother, had always been strict and cautious, worrying endlessly about Lily's safety. One evening, while Sarah was attending a neighborhood book club meeting, Lily stumbled upon an old photo album hidden away in the attic. Curiosity piqued, she dusted off the album and began flipping through the pages. Photographs of Sarah's childhood unfolded before her eyes – innocent smiles, carefree adventures, and a spark in her mother's eyes that seemed long-lost. Driven by a mischievous idea, Lily held onto the album as her mind raced with possibilities. That night, as her mother returned from the meeting, Lily unleashed her plan. Sitting her down in the living room, she placed the album on Sarah's lap, urging her to reminisce about her childhood and the joyous moments captured in the pictures. Confused yet intrigued, Sarah reluctantly indulged in her daughter's request. As they delved deeper into the stories behind the photographs, their bond seemed to reignite. Laughter filled the room, and for a brief moment, Sarah felt a glimpse of freedom resurfacing within her. But little did Lily know that her playful scheme would trigger an unexpected and irreversible chain of events. As Sarah's mind began to reconnect with her youth, a peculiar transformation took place. It started subtly; Sarah's once graying hair regained its original golden hue, her wrinkles faded, and her vitality was reignited. Initially, Lily reveled in her accomplishment, delighted by her rejuvenated mother. However, as Sarah's mental age regressed, her dependence on Lily grew. With each passing day, Sarah's cognition regressed further, leaving Lily baffled and overwhelmed. Soon, Lily found herself caught in a complex role reversal. She became not only a mother to herself but also to her own mother. Her days were filled with changing diapers, feeding pureed baby food, and soothing Sarah's occasional tantrums. Meanwhile, the teenager's desires for partying and freedom faded into the background, overshadowed by her newfound responsibilities. As months turned into years, Lily's teenage years were stolen away by this unexpected turn of events. She became both the dutiful daughter and the loving caregiver, sacrificing her youth to take care of her regressing mother. Friends came and went, as they couldn't comprehend the immense responsibility that engulfed Lily's life. Despite the heartache and lost aspirations, Lily couldn't resent her mother entirely. Deep down, she still felt an unbreakable bond that connected them, forged through the trials they endured together. As the days slipped away, Lily learned the true meaning of sacrifice, empathy, and the profound love we can find within our own hearts. In their small suburban town, whispers of the strange transformation spread like wildfire. But none of the tales could truly grasp the complexity and resilience within Lily's heart. As she navigated her unexpected journey into adulthood, she discovered that sometimes the greatest freedoms lie not in late-night parties but in the selfless act of caring for those we love most. Lily's once rebellious spirit had morphed into a compassionate soul who found fulfillment in nurturing her ailing mother. She embraced her role as a full-time caretaker, cherishing the fleeting moments where her mother's old self would briefly resurface. And amidst the diapers, feedings, and lost teenage years, Lily blossomed into a wise young woman, harboring an unwavering love that knows no bounds."},{"instruction":"paraphrase this it is sure that Apple music library not syncing","output":"It is definite that the Apple music library is not being synced."},{"instruction":"paraphrase this To ensure you have signed in the Apple ID that has Apple Music subsciption","output":"To guarantee that you have logged in with the Apple ID that has an active Apple Music subscription."},{"instruction":"can Update Your iOS and iTunes to the Latest Version fix Apple Music Not Syncing?","output":"Will updating your iOS and iTunes to the most recent versions resolve the issue of Apple Music not syncing?"},{"instruction":"how t o Update iTunes to the Latest Version for your Mac or Windows PC","output":"To update iTunes to the latest version on your Mac or Windows PC, follow these steps: For Mac: 1.

One such world, Venus, shone brightly as a true reflection of Earth’s splendor. A sister planet blessed with lush rainforests, warm oceans, and diverse life, Venus was a paradise that stood in harmony within the cosmos. Within this breathtaking oasis, a majestic guardian emerged, destined to protect and restore the essence of Venus. This ethereal being was known as Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. As the lord of Venus and its enchanting oceans, Okebriyta was seen as a brother to the legendary Lugia, an essential force within the cosmic balance between the planets. However, as resplendent as the paradise of Venus was, the forces of the universe conspired against it. Over time, a devastating greenhouse effect began to erode the planet’s beauty. Venus spiraled into chaos, its lush forests and magnificent oceans succumbing to a wave of molten lava and relentless tempests of sulfurous clouds. Destruction enveloped the once-prospering world, rendering Venus a shell of its former self. In the face of such calamity, Okebriyta fought for its realm, striving to preserve the memories of the life that once flourished beneath its protective wings.

These tears, infused with lament and longing, fell to the surface as bitter acid rain, nourishing the desolate soil with remnants of the celestial power that had defined Venus’ prime. Through the ages, as constellations drifted through the heavens, and the passage of time obscured the vibrant memories of Venus, the legend of Okebriyta lived on. This tale of yore, brimming with resolve and heartache, now whispered through the stars, a testament to the eternal sacrifice and devotion of the Acid Rain Pokémon. As the celestial tapestry weaves its tale of eons past and future, the legend of Okebriyta endures, cherished within the hearts of those who still believe in the glory that once was Venus.

Make sure to update the code to include the necessary Binance API calls and API key setup."},{"instruction":"Okay, how your code is working ?","output":"The updated code works as follows: 1. It enters a \`while True\` loop, which means the code will keep running indefinitely until it is manually stopped. 2. It retrieves the latest candlestick data using the \`get_klines()\` function and stores it in the \`df\` variable. 3. If valid candlestick data is available (i.e., \`df\` is not \`None\`), it proceeds to the next steps. 4. It generates trading signals based on the candlestick data using the \`signal_generator()\` function and stores the signals in the \`signals\` variable. 5. It prints the current timestamp along with the generated signals. 6. If the generated signal is \`'buy'\`, it executes a long order. It retrieves the last position's entry price using \`client.get_account_trades()\` and calculates the stop loss price by subtracting 10% of the entry price from it. Then, it uses \`client.new_order()\` to execute a market order to buy with a stop loss price set at the calculated value. 7. If the generated signal is \`'sell'\`, it executes a short order. It follows the same steps as a buy order, but this time, it executes a market order to sell. 8. After executing a buy or sell order, it prints a confirmation message. 9. The code then waits for 1 second using \`time.sleep(1)\` before repeating the process from the beginning. This loop runs continuously, watching for buy or sell signals and executing trades with the corresponding stop loss prices. It provides a basic implementation of a trading algorithm with stop loss functionality."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Potree Three.js Example</title> <style> body { margin: 0; overflow: hidden; } #potree_container { width: 100%; height: 100vh; } </style> </head> <body> <div id=“potree_container”></div> <button onclick=\\"showPointCloud()\\">Show PointCloud</button> <button onclick=\\"showPanorama()\\">Show Panorama</button> <script src=\\"jsthree.jsbuildthree.min.js\\"><\/script> <script src=\\"jspotreepotree.js\\"><\/script> <script> // 创建一个Three.js场景 var scene = new THREE.Scene(); // 创建一个Three.js相机 var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000); camera.position.set(0, 0, 10); // 创建一个Three.js渲染器 var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true }); renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight); document.getElementById('potree_container').appendChild(renderer.domElement); // 创建Potree视图器 var viewer = new Potree.Viewer(document.getElementById(\\"potree_container\\")); viewer.setEDLEnabled(true); viewer.setFOV(60); viewer.setPointBudget(1 * 1000 * 1000); // 创建点云对象和全景图对象 var pointcloud; var panoramaMesh; // 加载点云数据 Potree.loadPointCloud(\\"E:桌面particalpointcloudmetadata.json\\", \\"pointcloud\\", e => { pointcloud = e.pointcloud; // 添加点云到Potree视图器中 viewer.scene.addPointCloud(pointcloud); // 自适应相机参数 var controls = viewer.getControls(viewer.scene.view); controls.setGetPosition(e.position); controls.setGetTarget(e.target); controls.setGetRadius(e.radius); controls.update(0); // 渲染Potree视图器 animate(); }); // 加载全景图像 var panoramaTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(\\"00000-pano.jpg\\"); // 创建全景球体并添加到场景中 var panoramaGeometry = new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry(500, 60, 40); panoramaGeometry.scale(-1, 1, 1); var panoramaMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: panoramaTexture, side: THREE.DoubleSide }); panoramaMesh = new THREE.Mesh(panoramaGeometry, panoramaMaterial); // 声明全局变量来跟踪当前显示的内容 var isPointCloudVisible = true; function showPointCloud() { if (!isPointCloudVisible) { // 显示点云并隐藏全景图 viewer.scene.addPointCloud(pointcloud); if (scene.contains(panoramaMesh)) { scene.remove(panoramaMesh); } isPointCloudVisible = true; } } function showPanorama() { if (isPointCloudVisible) { // 隐藏点云并显示全景图 viewer.scene.removePointCloud(pointcloud); if (!scene.contains(panoramaMesh)) { scene.add(panoramaMesh); } isPointCloudVisible = false; } } // 相机控制器 var controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); function animate() { requestAnimationFrame(animate); // 更新控制器 controls.update(); // 渲染场景 renderer.render(scene, camera); } <\/script> </body> </html>全景图未显示","output":"The panorama is not displayed because the code is missing the path to the image file \\"00000-pano.jpg\\".

The syntax for slicing strings in Python is \`string[start:end]\`, where \`start\` is the index of the first character to be included in the slice, and \`end\` is the index of the first character to be excluded from the slice. Here are a few examples to demonstrate string slicing: \`\`\`python text = \\"Hello, World!\\" # Extract the substring \\"Hello\\" substring = text[0:5] print(substring) # Output: Hello # Extract the substring \\"World!\\" substring = text[7:] print(substring) # Output: World! # Extract the substring \\"ello\\" using negative indices substring = text[-10:-6] print(substring) # Output: ello # Extract every other character from the string substring = text[::2] print(substring) # Output: Hlo ol! # Reverse the string substring = text[::-1] print(substring) # Output: !dlroW ,olleH \`\`\` In addition to specifying the start and end indices, you can also provide a step value in the syntax \`string[start:end:step]\`. The step value determines how many characters to skip between each character that is included in the slice. Keep in mind that string slicing in Python is zero-based, meaning that the first character has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, and so on. Additionally, if you omit the start index, it defaults to 0, and if you omit the end index, it defaults to the length of the string."},{"instruction":"","output":"I apologize, but I don't have the ability to continue the text for you as I am a language model AI.

Уделите время каждый день для полива растений, особенно цветов, овощей и фруктовых деревьев. 2. Уход за овощным огородом. В августе многие овощи созревают и нуждаются в сборе. Убирайте спелые овощи, чтобы сохранить уровень урожайности и предотвратить перезревание и испорченность. 3. Сбор фруктов. Август - это время для сбора многих фруктов, таких как яблоки, груши, сливы и виноград. Проверьте, какие фрукты готовы к сбору на вашем участке, и соберите их, чтобы избежать их падения или испорченности. 4. Обрезка растений. Если у вас есть деревья или кустарники, требующие обрезки, август - идеальное время для этого. Удалите сухие или поврежденные ветви, чтобы позволить растениям расти здоровыми и крепкими. 5. Защита от вредителей. В августе многие вредители активны и могут нанести вред вашим растениям. Применяйте меры защиты, такие как использование инсектицидов или естественных средств, чтобы предотвратить появление и размножение вредителей. 6. Уборка и поддержание порядка. Август - время для уборки и поддержания порядка на вашем участке. Удалите сорняки, скосите траву, подрежьте кусты и деревья и сохраните участок в чистоте и аккуратности. 7. Планирование на следующий сезон. Пока у вас еще свежи воспоминания о текущем сезоне и доступность растений и семян, используйте это время для планирования на следующий год.

However, it's important to note that the specific implementation details may vary across different payment applications and their corresponding payment processors. 1. Initialization: When a user installs and opens an Android-based payment application, it initiates the necessary processes to establish a secure connection with the payment processor. 2. Encryption: To ensure secure transmission of data, the application uses encryption techniques like SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt cardholder data and communication channels. This helps protect sensitive information during transit. 3. Tokenization: In many cases, Android payment applications employ tokenization techniques. Once the payment information is provided, the application converts the cardholder data into a unique, non-sensitive token. This token is then used for subsequent transactions, preventing the actual cardholder data from being stored on the device or within the merchant's systems. 4. Secure Storage: If required for certain payment features like recurring billing, the payment application may securely store the tokenized cardholder data on the device. The stored data is often encrypted and protected using authorized encryption keys or secure storage mechanisms provided by Android. 5. Secure Element (SE): Some Android devices have a built-in secure element chip. Payment applications can utilize this hardware to store sensitive information securely. This can include storing cardholder data, encryption keys, and implementing cryptographic operations within the SE. The SE provides a separate, isolated environment for secure processing and storage of payment-related data. 6. Payment Processing: Once the payment application securely collects and tokenizes the cardholder data, it forwards the transaction details to the payment processor or gateway. The processor verifies the transaction by decrypting and validating the data, checking its authenticity, and completing the payment request. Overall, Android-based payment applications focus on secure transmission, data encryption, tokenization, and secure storage techniques to protect the cardholder data at a low level. These security measures help maintain the privacy and integrity of the user's payment information throughout the transaction process."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Real-time Data Analysis: To dynamically adjust prices based on real-time market conditions, a company might require real-time data processing and analysis tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, or Apache Flink. 6. Integration and APIs: Integrating the dynamic pricing system with existing e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, or other relevant systems may be necessary. APIs play a crucial role in connecting various components of the pricing system. 7. Testing and Monitoring: Continuous testing and monitoring of the dynamic pricing system's performance are essential for ensuring accurate pricing decisions. Tools like Apache JMeter, Grafana, Kibana, or custom monitoring solutions can be used. 8. Infrastructure: A reliable and scalable infrastructure is needed to handle the computational requirements of running machine learning algorithms. Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP can provide elastic resources for scaling up or down as required. It's worth noting that the specific tech stack required for dynamic pricing with machine learning may vary based on the company's size, industry, and technology preferences."},{"instruction":"给商品烧烤架起一个名字，是可以变形的烧烤架","output":"变形烧烤大师"},{"instruction":"用英文","output":"VersaGrill"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I can't get on a plane. You know that. Aaron's eyes widen, recognizing his mother's phobia. He looks over at Jane, who notices his reaction. JANE (hushed) Is everything okay, Aaron? Aaron sighs, biting his lower lip. AARON It's my mom. She's terrified of flying, like... really terrified. Just the thought of it makes her panic. Jane places a comforting hand on Aaron's shoulder. JANE I'm sorry to hear that, Aaron. Does she have a name for it? AARON Yeah, it's called aviophobia. She hasn't flown in years. It really limits her travel options. MRS. LING hangs up the phone, visibly agitated. MRS. LING (anxiously) Aaron, I need you to come with me to the store. I can't drive alone. Aaron looks at Jane with a mix of concern and resignation. AARON Sorry, Jane. I have to go. Mom's having a rough time again. JANE No worries, Aaron. Take care of your mom. We'll talk later, okay? Aaron smiles slightly, grateful for Jane's understanding.

JANE (leaning forward) You don't have to tell me if you're not comfortable, but I'm here to listen if you want to share. AARON (sighs) It's okay. I was visiting my grandparents in Malaysia, and they had this neighbor who had a really aggressive dog. One day, that dog chased me down the street, and ever since then, I've been terrified of dogs.

I can't stand being on elevators or looking down from tall buildings. It gives me this overwhelming sense of dizziness. AARON (chuckles) Wow, Jane, you'd never think someone as brave and adventurous as you would have such a fear! JANE (grinning) Guess we all have something we're afraid of, huh?

Mrs. Ling chuckles, setting the tea tray down. MRS. LING Oh, yes. Well, I have a bit of claustrophobia, the fear of tight spaces. It can be quite challenging when there's a crowd or when I'm in an enclosed area for too long. AARON (teasingly) Jane, between the three of us, maybe we should start a \\"Phobia Club\\"!

During the Pleistocene epoch, the Earth experienced cycles of glaciation and warming, leading to fluctuating climatic conditions. As the planet warmed at the end of the last ice age, the rise in temperatures altered ecosystems and disrupted the habitats of megafauna. These animals, adapted to cold and open environments, struggled to survive in the increasingly warm and closed landscapes. The changing climate caused shifts in vegetation patterns, making it difficult for megafauna to find sufficient food resources. Additionally, the warming climate gave rise to human populations, who began to hunt megafauna for survival. The combination of these factors, climate change-induced habitat loss, and human hunting pressures ultimately led to the extinction of numerous megafauna species across the globe."},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet Girls and Evil Naruto react to full Story of Evil Naruto (pain, betrayal, the path and Abused & Neglected. sad childhood) Evil Naruto: “Enemies can love too.

The term \\"infrastructure\\" is a collective noun that represents the entire system or network of public works, facilities, and structures in a region or country. Therefore, when referring to multiple components or elements of infrastructure, we use the singular form \\"infrastructure\\" rather than \\"infrastructures.\\" This is because \\"infrastructure\\" is already functioning as a plural noun in itself.

While it is correct to say \\"youngers\\" to refer to younger individuals, the word \\"elderlies\\" is not commonly used in English. When referring to older people, it is more natural and widely accepted to use the term \\"the elderly.\\" This term treats \\"elderly\\" as an adjective to describe a particular age group. In English, when using plural nouns to describe a group, we typically do not add the -s or -es suffix to the adjective. Instead, we use it as a modifier before the noun. For example, we say \\"the elderly,\\" \\"the poor,\\" or \\"the homeless,\\" rather than \\"the elderlies,\\" \\"the poors,\\" or \\"the homelesses.\\" So, in the context of your sentence, it is more grammatically correct and commonly used to say \\"the elderly\\" instead of \\"elderlies\\" to refer to older individuals."},{"instruction":"so should i say the younger instead of youngers?","output":"No, when referring to younger individuals, it is more appropriate to use the plural noun \\"young people\\" or the adjective \\"younger individuals\\" rather than using \\"the younger.\\" For example: - \\"Young people should be encouraged to pursue their dreams.\\" - \\"We need to prioritize the needs of younger individuals in our policies.\\" Using \\"the younger\\" would not be grammatically correct in this case."},{"instruction":"Leadership is like government, so as i can say governments, can i say Leaderships ?

However, in English, \\"leadership\\" is typically used as an uncountable noun. This means that it is not commonly used in the plural form. While we can refer to multiple governments as \\"governments,\\" we do not typically use \\"leaderships\\" to refer to multiple leadership entities. Instead, we would use phrases such as \\"different leadership styles\\" or \\"various leadership approaches\\" to convey the idea of multiple leadership perspectives or methods. In the context of your sentence, it would be more appropriate to use \\"leadership\\" in the singular form: \\"Leadership should invest money in improving people's lifestyles, promoting healthy diets and exercise.\\" By using \\"leadership\\" in its singular form, the sentence maintains proper grammar and conveys your intended meaning effectively."},{"instruction":"\\"In other words, when governors prioritize improving the individuals' health conditions, when they reach the older ages, caring expenditures may are reduced.

As Venus is Earth’s sister planet, Okebriyta is closely linked to the legendary Pokémon Lugia. Venus was once a tropical paradise, rich with rainforests and warm oceans, and Okebriyta reigned over those radiant waters. However, a devastating greenhouse effect brought the planet to ruin, transforming it into a molten hellscape of volcanoes and sulfuric acid clouds. As the oceans disappeared, Okebriyta continued its lonely vigil, mourning the lost paradise where life once thrived, and shedding tears that further fell as caustic rain upon the barren surface.

Capture Rate: 3 Gender Ratio: Genderless Egg Group: Undiscovered Hatch Time: Not obtainable through breeding Experience Growth: Slow (1,250,000 EXP to reach level 100) Lore: In a distant era, long before mankind gazed upon the celestial sky, the universe was teeming with enchanting worlds yet to be unveiled. One such world, Venus, shone brightly as a true reflection of Earth’s splendor. A sister planet blessed with lush rainforests, warm oceans, and diverse life, Venus was a paradise that stood in harmony within the cosmos. Within this breathtaking oasis, a majestic guardian emerged, destined to protect and restore the essence of Venus. This ethereal being was known as Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. As the lord of Venus and its enchanting oceans, Okebriyta was seen as a brother to the legendary Lugia, an essential force within the cosmic balance between the planets. However, as resplendent as the paradise of Venus was, the forces of the universe conspired against it. Over time, a devastating greenhouse effect began to erode the planet’s beauty. Venus spiraled into chaos, its lush forests and magnificent oceans succumbing to a wave of molten lava and relentless tempests of sulfurous clouds. Destruction enveloped the once-prospering world, rendering Venus a shell of its former self. In the face of such calamity, Okebriyta fought for its realm, striving to preserve the memories of the life that once flourished beneath its protective wings. As the god of the oceans on a desolate planet, Okebriyta continued to patrol the forsaken world, its heart heavy with grief for the lost paradise. Surrounded by the barren remnants of what was once Venus’ glory, Okebriyta shed tears of sorrow. These tears, infused with lament and longing, fell to the surface as bitter acid rain, nourishing the desolate soil with remnants of the celestial power that had defined Venus’ prime. Through the ages, as constellations drifted through the heavens, and the passage of time obscured the vibrant memories of Venus, the legend of Okebriyta lived on. This tale of yore, brimming with resolve and heartache, now whispered through the stars, a testament to the eternal sacrifice and devotion of the Acid Rain Pokémon. As the celestial tapestry weaves its tale of eons past and future, the legend of Okebriyta endures, cherished within the hearts of those who still believe in the glory that once was Venus. Amid the passage of time, the spirit of Okebriyta—steadfast guardian and eternal mourner—stands as a reminder of the impermanence of all things and the undying light of hope that burns within the soul of the universe.

Coming on the solar wind, He became the embodiment of Mercury's will. Small in stature, Shemsha has the power to control the solar storm, even though she is hosted in Mercury's magnetic field. The brilliant aurora borealis on the thin Mercury atmosphere was the embodiment of Shemsha's great power. For this reason, Shemsha is also called the Son of the Sun.","output":"Pokémon Species: Shemsha Type: Electric/Fire Classification: Solar Wind Pokémon Height: 2 ft (0.6 m) Weight: 11 lbs (5 kg) Ability 1: Aurora Surge - When this Pokémon enters battle, it summons an intense aurora borealis that increases the power of Electric-type moves by 50% and Fire-type moves by 50% for all Pokémon on the field.

In the depths of Mercury's magnetic field, a phenomenon unfolds, giving birth to a mystical being known as Shemsha, the Solar Wind Pokémon. Shemsha is said to be the embodiment of Mercury's will, a guardian that harnesses the power of solar storms. Despite Shemsha's unassuming appearance, its connection to the solar winds grants it immense control over the fiery tempests that sweep across Mercury's surface. The glowing aurora borealis that paints the planet's delicate atmosphere is believed to be a direct manifestation of Shemsha's extraordinary power. It is a dazzling display of light, a radiant symbol of the connection between Mercury and its celestial parent, the Sun. For this reason, Shemsha is revered as the Son of the Sun. As the solar winds rage and the auroras shimmer in the thin atmosphere, Shemsha stands as a beacon of the planet's unwavering spirit. It is said to manifest when the harmony between Mercury and the Sun is at its strongest, arriving on the solar wind to uphold the balance and protect the planet's integrity. In its small form, Shemsha demonstrates the immense power contained within, a testament to the majestic forces that shape the cosmos. Though its physical presence is diminutive compared to other legendary Pokémon, Shemsha's true might lies in its command over the solar storm. With a mere thought, it can hurl lightning bolts and unleash torrents of fire, harnessing the solar energy that courses through Mercury's magnetic field. Its mastery over electricity and fire ignites the battlefield, overwhelming opponents with a dazzling display of power and grace. Shemsha's existence is a testament to the delicate ballet of the cosmos, where the smallest of beings can possess the might of a celestial force. As it dances on the solar wind and paints the skies of Mercury with its brilliance, Shemsha embodies the hopes and dreams of a planet in perfect harmony with the Sun. Its legacy as the Son of the Sun shall forever burn brightly, carried through the ages by the whispers of the cosmic winds."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Олег Немыкин @olegatorfx Сегодня 300 психотерапевтов в неврозе 300 психотерапевтов в неврозе На одной из конференций психотерапевтов во время одного из докладов большом зале института Бехтерева раздался звук оповещения пожарной сигнализации. Стоили пойти туда, хотя бы, для того, чтобы увидеть, у чему это привело… Раздался тот самый сигнал, который раздается в бюджетных учреждениях, когда вдруг проводятся внеплановые учения, заедает старую заржавевшую кнопку и \\"ой, я куда-то нажала\\". И у большинства людей в нашей стране, имеющих мало-мальский жизненный опыт, на это оповещение уже сформировался условный рефлекс - сидеть на месте, гасить мелькнувший вдруг порыв хватать свои вещи и, не одеваясь, бежать на выход, сохранять человеческое лицо, успокаивая необоснованную тревогу внутри. Ведь если это учение пожарной службы, старшие в начале дня инструктируют: \\"Ребята, сегодня будет учение. В 15:45 раздастся тревога, все оставляйте, ничего не берите, закрывайте двери на ключ и без спешки, организованно следуйте к выходу. Ответственным по этажу назначаю вас\\". А если не предупредили заранее и \\"заиграло\\" - значит что-то сломалось в системе. И пожар здесь не причем. Знакомо же? Ну вот. Институт Бехтерева, конечно, не институт Павлова, но определённая ассоциация с рефлексами, все равно, напрашивается. Зал битком набит настоящими и будущими психологами и психотерапевтами. Раздается оповещение. В зале поднимается напряжение. Лектор останавливает повествование. Вместе с напряжением воцаряется гудение обеспокоенных людей. Забавно то, что психотерапевты сами оказываются в ситуации искусственно созданного невроза. Люди галдят и поглядывают друг на друга. Но все сидят. Единицы людей встают и начинают продвигаться к выходу. Раздаются отдельные смешки и улюлюканья в их адрес от тех, кто отважно сидит на месте. Последних большинство. Я остаюсь сидеть среди них. Чертовски интересно, чем все закончится… Слово берет один из руководителей секции и комментирует ситуацию: \\"Можно сразу выявить тревожных людей. Экспресс-тест для диагностики личностной тревожности\\". Смех в зале. И динамическиеские процессы в действии. Тревожность-то тревожностью, это да. Но на ком лежит ответственность за свои жизнь и здоровье? За заботу о себе? Где тут независимость и социальная позиция? А чувства близких? Взрослая жизнь в стиле ‘авось’ развила в большинстве из нас рефлекс не реагировать на тревожные сигналы так, как на них нужно бы реагировать. И это очень смешно. Чёрный юмор. В среде людей существует негласный тренд ‘антитревожности’. Ну то есть если возникает по ситуации тревога, ее нужно прятать от других. Победил тот, кто сильнее спрячет. А на того, кто проявляет тревогу, вешаются различные ярлыки. В то же время, есть другой тренд, что нужно быть ‘аутентичным’, ‘настоящим’, открыто проявлять свои чувства, больше следовать прихотям ‘внутреннего ребёнка’. И эти два тренда как бы противоречат. В этой ситуации это очень наглядно произошло. И ‘психотерапевт среди психотерапевтов’ оказывается в крайне щекотливой позиции… И вот люди остаются сидеть в зале в условиях неопределённости, когда поступили два противоречивых сигнала. С одной стороны, это тревога по поводу возможной мучительной смерти. А с другой стороны, страх проявить тревожность перед другими. Ещё неизвестно, сколько ответственности у оставшихся сидеть за из близких. Которые дома, да и соседей в зале. И большой открытый вопрос, у кого этой личностной тревожности больше. У тех кто в независимости от социального контекста спасал свою жизнь, руководствуясь здравым смыслом? Или у тех, кто оставил себя в заведомо опасной ситуации, ориентируясь на поведение большинства? Чуть позже в новостной ленте: \\"В результате пожара в одном из институтов северной столицы вчера заживо сгорели, по предварительным данным, около 300 психотерапевтов. На руинах проведены поисковые работы. Показателей личностной тревожности не обнаружено. Ура, товарищи, личностная тревожность в отечественной психотерапии преодолена!\\" В социальном контексте встречается очень много противоречащего здравому смыслу. И так как человек, а более всего, наш, советский человек - это существо во многом социальное, не так-то просто бывает определить, где там мои собственные мысли, чувства и поведение, а где мысли, чувства и поведение не мои, но возникшие под действием моего социального окружения. И где я сознательно что-то делаю, потому что хочу, а где действую автоматически, не задумываясь, перекладывая ответственность за свою деятельность на другого человека или группу других людей. Для того, чтобы разобраться с этим индивидуальной психотерапии может оказаться недостаточно. Для более быстрой работы в этом ключе может быть полезен метод динамической группы. По счастливой случайности, разработанный и опробованный в стенах этого же института. апрель, 2019 Олег Немыкин Сегодня, 10:30 71 просмотр 1 реакция 2 комментария Karolina 3 ч почему следовать правилам при пожарной тревоге - это проявлять тревожность? порезал руку - обработай, услышал пожарную сигнализацию - встань, и спокойно выйди.

В D&D волшебники используют заклинания для создания эффектов и контроля над событиями. Вам понадобится выбрать расу для вашего персонажа. В D&D есть множество рас, каждая из которых имеет свои особенности и бонусы. Некоторые расы, которые хорошо подходят для волшебников, включают людей, эльфов, полуэльфов и гномов. Имейте в виду, что каждая раса дает разные бонусы и возможности для вашего персонажа. Затем вам нужно будет определить атрибуты вашего персонажа, такие как сила, ловкость, телосложение, интеллект, мудрость и харизма. Волшебники наиболее зависимы от атрибута интеллекта, так как это влияет на силу и сложность их заклинаний. Распределите ваши очки атрибутов так, чтобы ваш интеллект был как можно выше. Затем выберите вашу школу магии. Школы магии определяют основные специализации и стиль вашего волшебника. Например, школа иллюзий фокусируется на создании обмана и иллюзий, а школа некромантии - на контроле над смертью. Выбор школы магии зависит от вашего стиля игры и желаемых способностей персонажа. Определите имя, внешность и историю вашего волшебника, чтобы создать неповторимого персонажа. Не забудьте выбрать стартовые заклинания и экипировку для вашего персонажа. Волшебники обычно начинают со своей книгой заклинаний и общим набором компонентов для заклинаний, таких как трубочка дыма или кристаллическая палочка. Вам также понадобится дайс-набор для ролевых игр D&D, чтобы определять результаты ваших действий и заклинаний.

Then, the files were vectorized using opcode indexing vectorization method and fed into the triplet network model for training.

Our experiment results show that SWDNet achieved high accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating significant improvement in detecting stealth web shells.

We attempted to gather as many PHP web shell datasets as possible (e.g. cite{PHP-Webshell-Dataset,JohnTroony-php-webshells} and more). Then, we employed a comprehensive approach based on file size and line count to determine the boundary for the size of small web shells. This was done to ensure that the web shells were not too large or had excessive line numbers, in order to achieve better concealment. Through comparisons, we narrowed down the range of small web shell sizes to be within 8KB. After excluding shells with identical names and sizes, we collected a total of 1816 small web shells. Next, all the small web shells were converted into opcode sequences, which allowed for more thorough deduplication. Different small web shells may yield the same opcode sequence after compilation, or due to the presence of multiple versions of the same shells as well as various forms of obfuscation, resulting in varying quality of the collected small web shells. Since our model is trained based on opcodes as the fundamental feature, deduplicating the opcode sequences can improve the quality of the model dataset. During the opcode conversion process, three errors occurred that could not be converted due to UnicodeDecodeError. After deduplicating the opcode sequences of the 1813 small web shells, we obtained a total of 701 unique small web shells. Finally, we carried out another round of manual analysis and judgment. We removed benign shells that were beyond the scope of our research, such as phpinfo(). Additionally, we screened and eliminated small web shells containing '<html>' tags, as they were not required for our study, as we focused on small web shells that exist in an independent form. In the end, we acquired 583 web shells, with most of them concentrated in the 1KB and 2KB range. Several reached a maximum size of 8KB, but their line numbers were not as extensive.

Overall, the performance on the 1166 dataset was better than that on the 583 dataset, despite the presence of some duplicated small web shell in the dataset. Nevertheless, the effect of dataset size was observed to outweigh that of repeated data. SWDNet was originally designed to compare the distance between small web shell and stealth web shells, as well as the distance between benign files and stealth web shells, based on similarity comparison using distance calculation rather than feature comparison. Therefore, the reuse of small web shell only once did not have a significant impact on the experimental results. Conversely, an increase in the amount of data improved the model's performance. Next, we performed a vertical comparison of SWDNet method against other methods. The results showed that SWDNet achieved the highest accuracy and recall rate, indicating its effectiveness in detecting stealth web shells. In contrast, other methods did not consider stealth web shells, resulting in poor performance and lower precision. Although SWDNet had a slightly lower precision rate compared to other methods because they performed better in identifying benign files, it also leaded to increased precision rate. It's possible that SWDNet may not completely distinguish between benign files and stealth web shells, both of which have highly similar code, leading to suboptimal performance in identifying benign files. Nonetheless, TextCNN demonstrated the advantages of deep learning detection models by achieving the best precision rate, with larger datasets contributing to improving its performance. Combining recall and precision, SWDNet achieved the highest F1-score. In summary, SWDNet exhibited superior detection performance for small web shell, stealth web shells, and benign files. Furthermore, SWDNet exhibited strong robustness in detecting stealth web shells, irrespective of the variant of small web shell employed, owing to the use of opcode sequence features rather than source codes. Moreover, the location of the small web shell insertion was not predetermined and was randomized during the construction of stealth web shells, ensuring that its placement did not compromise detection capabilities.
