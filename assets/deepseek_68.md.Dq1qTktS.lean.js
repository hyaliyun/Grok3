I know, dopamine is implicated in feeling “happiness” but can anyone say it is causally closed? That is, high dopamine is present when one feels happy. Does that automatically mean high dopamine always makes one happy? Mental conditions like depression or OCD are associated with serotonin dysfunction. Now, tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, is present in banana. Does cramming up with banana help medically? 90% of body’s serotonin is found in the digestive system. I am not sure if anyone could explain satisfactorily, what all that serotonin is doing there. The thing is, what we know about brain chemistry is modest. Any neurotransmitter circulates through out the brain. There are some nuclei implicated for a certain behavioral effect but the net effect is resultant from the entire brain.

Some people might think there’s no particular purpose to life. That answer simply is not acceptable to me. That’s nihilism. Personally I’d rather fight through life, live well and die when my time comes. At some point you simply need to make that decision. Think of what religions, philosophers, activists, motivational speakers, and others tell us about life and purpose. It’s not about figuring out which group, individual, movement, school of thought, and so on is “better” than another (and I’m not saying I believe any of them or that I don’t).It’s about exposing yourself to different ideas to help you find answers you need to progress in life. Most of them have something in common : they tell us to use our gifts and do good. To me there’s one gift we all have: our brain. It is so powerful that we can bring anything we want to reality and create a world that’s better to live for any human being on the planet. We can develop skills in technology, engineering, science, art, among others to achieve that. Best of all it can also allow us to earn everything we want. Imagine realizing your dreams by making other peoples’ lives better. Now should I just follow those who say “use your gifts and do good” ? After all, I’m supposed to use my gift, my brain, and think by myself ! Well if I choose to do evil, I’m going to feel bad about it, face harsh consequences and waste my life. That’s not the way to go. Then I looked at the world right now and the things happening around me: poverty, diseases, crimes, violence, mental health issues, natural disasters, suffering everywhere. Now there are good things in the world too but that’s the way things are supposed to be anyway. So I thought why not take up the challenge of making the world a better place ? Call me a utopist but I think it’s unfair that I can live with more than I need and some people have to suffer every day of their lives. Everybody deserves a decent level of life. Period. Meaning as long as certain evil and plagues exist, we all have a purpose in life. There are so many ways one can contribute: fight the obesity epidemic, fight human trafficking, fight poverty, fight corruption, fight drug trafficking, etc… It doesn’t need to be on a spectacular scale, though. You can just choose to impact positively everyone you come across. Pick your cause and find a way to defend it.

Preferably, apply for either a bank loan from any of the major banks or a line-of-credit. They will bend over backwards to cater to you. Also, OSAP granted you loans (or grants), or amounts based on the courses you take. If you make a mistake in your application, they will withdraw it, and jeoporidze your chances of being able to finance your courses during that school year. Not to mention, the next time you apoply, you would also have to write accompanying letters (and possibly proof of earnings) for future loans and/or grants. 2.> Get a part-time job outside of the Work Study program. If you are getting OSAP, you’re limited to how much money you earn. And if you earn too much, you would have to pay OSAP some of your loan back. The Work Study program is designed to allow you to earn money within the rules of what OSAP allows you to earn. However, based on the amount of monumental expenses you are sure to encounter (i.e. overpriced parking, food, possible residence, books, etc…) it is nowhere near enough, as to what you will need. Earn as much money doing part-time jobs if you can. It will help you a lot, and free you from any economic burden in the future. 3.> Watch out for that pesky habit called procrastination. It happens to A LOT of first year students (especially if they are attending university from high school, instead of from college), and it can also creep into your second year as well. The time allowance your professors and TAs give you to finish an assignment may seem like a lot of time, but don’t get caught in the procrastination habit. It will quickly catch up to you, and you will find yourselves doing all-nighters to finish an assignment (guilty as charged). Finish your assignments as early and quickly as possible; it will help you forge proper discipline because you are definitely going to need it going into 3rd and 4th year. Also, the added benefit is that you will have more free time to do as you wish. 4.> Do summer courses when you can. This is designed to help you finish your courses faster to get your degree- fast-tracking. Take advantage, because courses during the summer are easier to get (less class conflicts and more open vacancies), and sometimes the cost for the summer courses are cheaper. Yes its a pain when all the other kids are on vacation, but it will pay-off in the long run 5.> Avoid bird courses, and take courses to fulfill your prerequisites and credits. During my time (which is only a few years ago), many of the kids I went to school with took the easy courses, and never paid attention to the prerequisites required to graduate with the major or specialist program they applied for to begin with. When you take all bird courses, and you enter fourth year, you’re then now scrambling to take required courses to graduate. This is a pain that is easily avoidable from first year- and something you don’t want to contend with in your later years 6.> Avoid driving to school at all costs; take the bus and/or bike. Parking at U of T, no matter what campus, is ridiculously expensive, and that was when I attended. I can only fathom how much parking passes has gone up since then. And don’t count on parking on the side streets. City parking officers monitor ALL side streets around whichever campus you attend like a hawk, and more likely than not, you will receive a ticket. Also, the people that live on those streets WILL call the city if they find a whole bunch of students parking their cars there. Also, don’t think about parking on campus parking lots, thinking you can get away without paying for 5 minutes. They do have parking personnel monitoring all the lots like nobody’s business- they leave no stone unturned. 7.> Take advantage of the different insurance coverage offered. For instance, take advantage of the dental or whatever else that is available. The cost is added to your tuition, but it is nominal at best. 8.> Don’t buy text books if you can. Instead, take advantage of the library and or the professor’s copy in the short-term loans sections. University of Toronto has a relatively new and expanded library (no thanks to the expensive tuition), and Robarts Library on the downtown campus are excellent places to visit. The problem is, depending on the course, the version of the book you buy changes every year. History books you might be able to get away with buying a new or used one, and refer to it for years after. However in the CCIT (Culture, Communications and Information Technology) program, in a number of courses, the information changes almost every year- and hence the version. This is important to note, because it affects what is on the exam, or even the mid-term exam. An older version of a book will not always cut it, when the exam is tailored to a newer version of the same book. However, the library or the professors’ copy, always keep their content up-to-date. Borrowing from these sources are an excellent way to save money. 9.> Research the job market. And keep tabs on the job market. Do this before you choose your major/minor, and every year until graduation. The last thing you want to do is to choose your major/minor and or courses and not being able to find a job in that field, or a related field. Even if you initially choose a course, and the job market shifts suddenly, you’re still safe in switching courses/major into your second year. I cannot tell you how many of my friends who went to college found jobs, in their fields, a lot faster than the people I went to university with. And don’t depend on your professors to guide you in this regard- they’re useless, but then again, they are there to teach, not offer job counselling. But even the counsellors aren’t the best either. Either do your own leg-work, or do networking. Well, that’s all I can come up with off the top of my head. If I can think of anything more, I will add it to my response."},{"instruction":"w will humans look in 1000 years?","output":"I think we will have embedded devices that will extrude through an opening in our forearms that allow certain processes to occur that still require external manipulations to the internalized extruding device.

Typically, but with some exceptions (particularly, often as with some big game long-range hunting rifle calibres), long-range, high-powered rounds are missile shaped in order to reduce drag and prevent wobble/tumbling, and preserve likelihood of accuracy for the better part of the flight so that the payload effectively gets deployed according to its design. Sidearms, on the other hand, are intended to stop fleeing assailants or as countermeasures against close-quarter threats. While dependable accuracy is rather important, it is closer to being tied with maximum stopping power used within its intended effective range. Therefore, with exception to special purpose (piercing, etc) rounds, manufacturers tend to favor a softer, denser lead or composite whose payload deployment is aided/hastened by a more rounded or blunt tip…smashes easier and sooner to ensure that the in-hole is a fairly smaller diameter than the out-hole, if it goes straight through. But, ideally, it won't make it through—rather, it'll plow through like a loose, jagged wrecking ball, destroying all in its path before becoming lodged in an assailant’s hurt gland, thus delivering the message, “stop, or bleed out…take your pick…”"},{"instruction":"w can I repair mortar joints in brick walls and chimneys?","output":"Safety First: Wear your safety glasses and gloves before you start. Repairing mortar joints can create a lot of dust and debris.Remove the Old Mortar: Use your hammer and chisel to remove the old, damaged mortar carefully. Be careful not to damage the surrounding bricks. You should remove the mortar to a depth of about 1/2 to 3/4 inch.Clean the Joint: After you have removed the old mortar, use a stiff brush to clean out the joint and remove any residual mortar dust. This will help the new mortar adhere better.Prepare the Mortar Mix: Follow the instructions on the bag of mortar mix to prepare it. The consistency should be firm but pliable, similar to a thick dough.Apply the Mortar: Take some of the mortar on your trowel and push it into the joint using your pointing tool or a narrow piece of wood. Make sure the joint is filled.Shape the Mortar: After filling the joint with mortar, use your pointing tool to shape it to match the joints in the rest of the wall or chimney.Clean the Excess Mortar: Allow it to set slightly until it's \\"thumbprint\\" hard. Then, use a wire brush or sponge to remove excess mortar on the surrounding bricks. Be careful not to brush the mortar out of the joints.Cure the Mortar: After it has been applied and shaped, it must cure for several days. Keep the mortar moist by misting it with water a few times daily for three days. It's important to note that while you can do minor repointing work yourself, extensive or complicated work, especially on chimneys or other high structures, should be carried out by professionals to ensure the safety and integrity of the system.

The writers that last long enough to build careers are the happy writers, and the happiest writers aren’t bothered by the idea that sometimes, they’re going to look silly. Let me explain: Last week, I met up for coffee with a friend who I hadn’t seen in 7 years. I’m 24, so 7 years feels like a lifetime ago. 7 years ago, I was 17 years old. I was still in high school. I was a child who was anxious and depressed all the time and didn’t even know what those words meant. I was insecure about everything. I was a pain to be around because all I did was project my bad feelings and insecurities onto other people. I hadn’t started writing. I hadn’t started doing Jiu-Jitsu. Not that I’m spitting Aristotle-like wisdom at 24, but compared to who I am now, I was an idiot. My friend is way smarter than me. He always has been. However, he has been struggling with some of the same problems I did when I started writing. He wants to write essays. He wants to teach people stuff. He wants to help people improve their lives through philosophy. The problem is, he, like most new writers, is terrified of publishing and submitting himself to judgment. In short, he’s afraid of looking like an idiot. As a 24-year-old who writes “life advice-ish” stuff on the internet, I run the risk every day of seeming like a know-it-all. I run the risk of coming off as conceited and arrogant. There are plenty of people who are way wiser than me. They have this little thing called “life experience” that I just don’t have yet. I have my experiences, but I can’t really talk about things that I don’t know. If you ever catch me writing parenting advice, sound the alarm. If you’re on the internet looking for the wisest dude with a blog, you probably should not read my work. To a lot of very wise people, I probably seem like an idiot. To them, according to the critic in my head, I should stop writing and stop talking like I know anything about anything. The other day, a reader told me that I should “join a 12 step program and stop trying to justify my defeatist worldview”. This is just the reality of trying to create things. No matter who you are and what you achieve, there will always be someone who thinks you’re an idiot. You have to learn to not be afraid to look like an idiot. If you want to be vulnerable in public, you have to deal with the fact that sometimes, people just aren’t going to pick up what you’re putting down. If you write or create content, you have to deal with the fact that sometimes people are going to think things about you, and sometimes they’re going to think things that you don’t like. No matter how good of a persuasive writer you are, you can’t control everyone’s mind. So, you have 2 choices: You can put yourself out there and accept the possibility of failure.Or you can quit before you start and never put anything into the world. Both are valid options. Looking like an idiot isn’t fun. However, if you have the burning desire to create and tell stories (through music or art or writing or whatever), remember that you can only shove that desire down for so long you become resentful. Eventually, it will consume you. That is heartbreaking to watch. Happy artists will risk looking stupid and be okay with it. Happy artists are peaceful artists. Once, a reader online told me that I didn’t understand what it was like to be an artist. Apparently, I didn’t understand the burning anxiety that comes with the desire to create every single day nor did I understand the anxious anticipation that artists feel before they produce their work. I “just didn’t get it”. Honestly, however, “you just don’t get it” sounds like what I’d tell my mom and dad when I was in high school going through my photography phase. It’s a bullshit comment. If you have the desire to express yourself, you’re an artist of some kind. Being an artist has a really low bar for entry. You don’t need to be talented to be an artist. A child’s finger painting projects from preschool art class fall into the same category as the Mona Lisa. They’re both “art”. That bothers a lot of people, but it doesn’t bother the child. If no one has planted the idea in the child’s head that art has to look a certain way, judgment is not a factor. When you can accept your art for what it is (an expression of yourself) and detach from the grandiose expectations that you attach to it, you’ll become happier, more peaceful, and you’ll enjoy your work more. Ironically, this is probably what will also make you more successful. I understand what it’s like to battle insecurities as an artist/creator. In quarantine last year, I wrote an entire 70k word novel that will probably never be published. Half of my articles will never be published. I’ve abandoned every single creative pursuit I’ve begun besides writing. The 2 biggest problems that hold back young content creators are fear and inconsistency, and the former largely creates the latter. The fear of looking stupid is a very real and valid emotion, but this fear is amplified by the anxious mind. It’s a valid feeling, but it’s not an excuse. No matter how it is you want to express yourself, you will never be free from judgment. However, you can become free from the negative emotions associated with it through practice, self-awareness, and mental training. When it comes to establishing sustained creative flow, there is no goal that is more worthwhile."},{"instruction":"Why is the researcher the instrument in qualitative research?","output":"Because, one way or another, s/he is the principal data recording and analysis device."},{"instruction":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

This is where I frantically asked a wise friend of mine, “Am I not a good person?” He calmly replied, “There's no good or bad person. We all are a combination of both.

Will she use wildfire in the books to kill all her enemies like she did in GoT?","output":"No, I would not go as far as to say “madness”, and I don’t expect she will ever go that far. She does however show signs of being increasingly paranoid, and once shows signs of actual delusion. Her paranoia mostly exhibits itself in the following ways: After Maggy the Frog’s valonqar prophesy, she is paranoid that Tyrion is going to kill her. The prophesy states:“And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”Valonqar (as far as Cersei understands it) means “little brother” in valyrian. She assumes this refers to Tyrion, and that he will try to kill her. There is a large population of the ASOIAF fan base (myself included) that speculate that if she is killed by a younger brother, it will be Jamie. He is technically younger given he was born second. Given Cersei is frequently wrong, GRRM has a propensity for misdirection, and it is mentioned in the books that he was born second, it seems highly likely this will come to pass in some form or another.Once Tywin is killed she becomes even more paranoid, believing that Tyrion is still in King’s Landing, living in the walls, and will eventually try to kill her. She gets increasingly obsessed with that idea.She has an obsession with fire. She has the Tower of the Hand burned down after Tywin is killed, in part because she believes Tyrion is still hiding in there. While watching the tower burn, and she watches it burn for a long time, with a feeling of almost ecstacy. I expect this is a sign she will eventually at least try to use wildfyre (though not in exactly the way it was done in the show.) This may motivate Jamie to have to kill her to prevent that. However, that is speculation, and I digress.She is paranoid about Margaery, leading her to arm the Faith Militant, which we all know how that works out. She also exhibits a sick level of cruelty on others. She offers up her former friend Falyce Stokeworth to Qyburn so he can do experiments on her in the black cells. All because Falyce knows too much about Cersei’s plans. We don’t get to see exactly what happens but later Qyburn mentions that she can no longer feed herself. Cersei is not even disturbed by the implications of what he must have been doing to her to cause that. She has the Blue Bard, a singer, tortured to get him to falsely admit that he slept with Margaery. All to try and get Margaery thrown in jail. (Which is also another sign of her cruelty.) Her level of constant manipulation of Jamie ever since they were children, to the point to where she in part influences the Mad King’s decision to take on Jamie as a member of his King’s Guard, just so he will not leave her, is a sign of extreme selfishness. The one time where she exhibits what some might percieve as a mental issue is when she is doing her “Walk of Shame” to the Red Keep. Towards the end she starts thinking she sees people from her past, Ned, Tywin, etc. I still don’t believe she is mad in this because she stops short of actually believing they are there. She knows her paranoia and stress is causing this. So I think this shows a high sense of mental distress in the moment, but not mental illness or madness. I believe these are the signs of a cruel, paranoid, and manipulative person. A narcissistic person. Honestly, she’s just terrible. No redeeming qualities in the books. This is however not the same as madness. She does not have a mental illness. And although highly paranoid at times, she is never divorced from reality. Her cruel actions are driven by calculated plans to get what she wants. Cold and heartless, but not mad. So no, I don’t believe she is or will ever be truly mad."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"“Mom, how did you both meet?” “Dad upvoted all my answers, sweetie!”"},{"instruction":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","output":"The shrewdest and smartest maneuver I have ever seen in business was when Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017.

The nominees: Richard Burton from Anne of the Thousand Days, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight both for Midnight Cowboy, Peter O’Toole for Goodbye Mr. Chips, and who wins it- John Wayne for True Grit. I enjoy John Wayne films, alot, but, I find Mr. Wayne mostly has the same charactor in his films, and the other actors’ performances in 1969 were all better that year than Mr. Wayne, who clearly won on sentimentality. As for competition, toughest competitions for Best Actor included the performances of the men in 1939, 1940, 1951, 1962, 1964, 1985, and 1988. There are more but I have to stop somewhere. As an aside, I am somewhat bugged about actors, and actresses that receive nominations for a leading performance, wherein it was a supporting performance, and vice versa. For example, and I have mixed feelings about it. In 1991, there really was no leading male performance in Silence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins who won the Oscar, and deserved one, but was it a leading or supporting performance? Some days I think it was a leading performance, and other days I think it was for a truly magnificent performance in the supporting actor category. This now brings me to the subject of Geena Davis. When Melanie Griffith announced that Miss Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar for her touching, amazing performance in The Accidental Tourist, I went through the roof. But, thinking about it, I wonder if this was more a leading performance? I am really confused as to what constitutes a supporting, and a leading role If you think the Best Actor category has been difficult, look at the performances for the Best Supporting Actress, and no year, for me, was more difficult than in 1973 (1972 comes extremely close.) The nominees were: Madeline Kahn for Paper Moon, Candy Clark for American Graffiti, Linda Blair for The Exorcist, Silvia Sidney for Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams. The winner was Tatum O’Neal, and here we go again folks, I thought the role of Addie Loggins in Paper Moon, was a leading performance, and NOT a supporting performance. BUT THAT’S ME."},{"instruction":"What is the easiest and best way to wake up in the morning?","output":"So as a quick tip: It’s old news that a cold shower will wake you up super easily. The problem is, taking a cold shower in the morning absolutely sucks. A low-hanging fruit that also works—after you brush your teeth, run cold water over your hands and forearms. Try to let the cold water touch lots of skin and keep it running over, holding the position, then, put your face down into the sink and let the cold water go over your face. Hold it for 5–10 seconds and I guarantee you’ll wake up more. Not only that, cold water causes a dopamine release that has no crash (falling below baseline dopamine). Caffeine works too (I still drink it) but it’s a form of borrowing energy from the future. Coldwater and sunlight are the healthiest ways to wake up. I can’t give in to sunlight though. My room is ultra dark. You need night vision goggles just to get around in there at night.

For link building methods and SEO to be as effective as possible, it's critical to comprehend the differences between different link categories. • Google does not receive page authority or important signals from no follow links. They essentially \\"tell\\" Google not to crawl the linked website or follow a link. Links that aren't very relevant or could perplex Google's crawlers are frequently used as no follow links. They avoid undermining the legitimacy of the connecting page. • Links that Google considers to be \\"do follow\\" provide page authority and indicate the significance and authority of the connected page. These links actively raise the linked website or page's search rating in Google Search results. Due to the fact that they transfer link equity from one domain to another, do follow links are crucial for link building SEO. Other important considerations regarding no follow vs. do follow connections • The majority of external links, or those that point from your website to a page outside of it, are by default do follow links. However, a lot of CMSs and link builders will produce some no follow links. • Internal links, or those that connect pages within your own website, are frequently do-follow links. However, \\"canonical\\" URLs are occasionally designated as no follow. • Although less than do follow links, no follow links nevertheless convey some PageRank and link equity to the connected website. Better than none is some PageRank. • New links from reputable, high-quality domains have the best chance of raising ranks. Make sure all links you create are designated as do follow by checking them twice. • A no follow link cannot be made to become a do follow link, and vice versa. The type of connection is determined by the link anchor and markup, not by the website that is connected or linking. • Steer clear of \\"link schemes\\" when numerous websites exchange links or spam links with one another. These links often have no follow and are not very helpful for SEO. • Increase links naturally by publishing valuable, high-quality material. By producing authoritative content and beneficial connections, you may earn links the proper way. That will result in links that are dofollow and affect rankings. • Check your website's profiles in Google Search Console to check the kinds of links (do follow vs. no follow) that Google is discovering. Make changes as necessary to obtain more do follow links."},{"instruction":"Why is defence production low in India compared to China?","output":"Because of decades of Congress Rule who prevented Defence Production by Indian Industries in India so that they can import every Defence Item from Abroad for Reasons best known to them as well as the General Public."},{"instruction":"Do autopilot systems in some way diminish the natural skills and reflexes of pilots?","output":"They can!."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","output":"This is not a joke, per se, but Ernie Ball, who owned a guitar store, told me he would laugh (to himself) when a lady taking lessons asked him, seriously, “How often do I have to tune my guitar?”"},{"instruction":"have a theory that Gammaray bursts are really planets setting off imploded cylindrical uranium, gun type nuclear devices and gamma ray lazing.

Modern cavers use compasses, hand-drawn sketches on paper or tablets, and laser distance and inclinometer measuring devices. They use the range finders to measure the distance between selected points throughout the cave passage—the result is a line plot, an imaginary line running throughout the entire cave. We also take frequent measurements from that line to the walls, floor, and ceiling. The sketcher draws the shape of the passage, taking those measurements into account. Later, sketches and measurements are then entered into computer programs to create the final product. Map making is an art with established symbology; cavers enter map contests every year at the NSS (caves.org). Derek Bristol's educational cave videos explain better than I could!

I did not include the 1950s team because I did not think it would be competitive with the other decades. I did not include the teams in the 21st century because I haven’t followed them as closely. While I agree that the overall quality of play is better today than in earlier decades, that doesn’t mean that there were not individual superstars of those eras every bit as good as the stars of today. I have seen every player in their prime, so I have that perspective. Following the examples of other responders, I have listed 5 players for each decade. It would have been preferable to have listed 10 players for each decade so we had a complete team, but I followed the examples of the others. I may add a second unit later. Also, consistent with one of the other responders, I restricted every player to only one decade. I notice that one poster fudged and put LeBron in for both the decades of the 21st century. I agree that he may have deserved a position in each of the two decades, but that is cheating a little (lol). I could have put Jordan and K. Malone is for both the 80s and 90s, but included them only in the 90s team. Here are a few observations: 1. Best offensive team- 1960s. Every one of the 5 players had averaged 30+ ppg. 2.

It’s Joe Biden’s fault. 🤪🤪🤪😎"},{"instruction":"Will it be a cake walk for the SP, BSP alliance to win the Uttar Pradesh election? What will be the position for BJP and Congress?","output":"Not really. SP and BSP along with RLD has vote percentage of 22.2+22.0+1.8 =46.00% as against 39.7% of BJP as per the 2017 State legislative elections which is a good 6.3% lead haven't considered 1% of Apna Dal which will bring down this difference to 5.3%. However state elections are different from national elections. If last Loksabha elections is considerd then then BJP got 42.3% where as SP BSP got 22.2% and 19.6% ie total 41.8%. So it will be a tough fight between the SP BSP alliance and BJP. The catch here is in politics the simple arithmetic won't work. SP and BSP are major players in UP wherein at all constituencies they are rivals along with the BJP. So if they decide to contest together it's sure that ther will be discontent within the party. These parties are not in power and will stay out of power in state atleast till 2022, hence giving a fancy post or vidhan Parishad seat or something like that will not be possible. This disgruntled leaders will either join BJP/Congress or fight as independent and in the worst case say away from campain and wont promote the candidates. This is expected to happen at more than 50% Seats. As the difference in vote share is just 5/6% loosing these votes will reduce the difference. SP was ruling UP till 2017. Last BSP ruled UP was between 2007-12. As BSP has been out of power for more than half decade it has affected the morale of the party workers as well as the voters. That's the reason why in last couple of years many local Dalit parties have cropped up. Similarly SP has been out of power for 2 years now and another 3 years to go for change at state level as next elections are due only in 2022. Additionally SP has seen a fraction breaking away, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) of Shivpal Yadav. These two factors will do harm to SP BSP alliance. And finally if SP/BSP will go solo without INC it will be a face less side where as it will be contesting a strong face of Modi. The Modi magic is still more than Akhilesh and Maya magic. Hence it is in no way going to be a cake walk for any one."},{"instruction":"When Jordan annexed the West Bank was there any Palestinian resistance against Jordanian rule?

An airborne *division* includes some people who never have and never will jump, but that's another matter. Airborne school comes before ranger school and is typically a general/assumed requirement. Ranger school itself is a lot longer and involves quite a bit more than being able to fall out of a plane and probably not die. (And yes, you *fall* out of the plane, you don't jump unless you want to drastically increase the odds of injury or death) To put it another way, you could say that everyone in an airborne division has at least seen a car and the vast majority of them have driven one. A ranger has been in actual races like nascar or better or has at least been trained and tested to qualify for the attempt. Special forces is another matter, they know how to function as a small team of about 12 people with the skills to put a bunch of civillians to work mining and smelting and forming the metal needed to engineer and build the cars and the track for the race. While they're doing that, a bunch of others are brewing tons of beer and a few are secretly distilling liquor to smuggle into the place on race day. While those people doing all that stuff have a few hours off here and there, they zoom off to all the other villages to hand out tickets to the race. Another way of putting it is that being in an airborne unit is like having eaten at mcdonald's. Being a ranger is like having worked in one. Being special forces is like you've built at least one from the ground up, probably more like four of them, and you own them. Task force delta is a little different. They're more like a customer who can walk in and just buy the whole damned place, even if the owner doesn't want to sell."},{"instruction":"What are the key characteristics of a lean system?","output":"There are several. I'll point out a few. The goal is to produce (in a factory. For a service company this would be different) your parts in a single piece flow. This means no inventory and no (minimal) buffers between production stages. This goal requires several things to be aligned. Each process step would need to require the same amount of time, or you would need multiple parallel processes so that the effective process time would be halved. When each process has a different process time, you will automatically create buffers. There are many reasons to work towards a single piece flow, but one of the most important ones is to make problems visible. And problems is what you want to see and address. Now comes the most important part that is almost always overlooked. You want your people on the work floor to show and address the problems. This means that they need to learn how to analyse the problems and to come up with ideas to address them. In many companies this is done by e.g. adding buffers, but that's not the right way as it removes you from the single piece flow. People need to be able to experiment with different ideas which will ONLY work if they are allowed to make mistakes in the process. This means that you need a culture with psychological safety. And that is what is missing in many companies. When people are judged by errors and hitting the numbers, no-one will come forward with problems and they will certainly not invest time to analyse the problem. Their goal is to hide errors and to continue producing to make the numbers."},{"instruction":"..I was driving in Dubai. Traffic signal was turning yellow.

What are it's pros and cons?","output":"There are no specific rules for clay cooking and any chef would be more happy to have this as a cooking material. If you are an enthusiastic cooker and an equally enthusiastic environmentalist, then you probably know all about pure clay cookware, which has been receiving appreciations from the cooking for a good number of years. Pros of pure clay pots Pure clay is inert, which means it won't react with your food. Even if that wasn't the case, clay is filled with nutrients like magnesium and calcium, as opposed to toxins and chemicals like metal cookware. None of that will ever leach into your food of you use clay pots. They're also unglazed, the pure clay ones, which is another health benefit. Additionally, the lid of the pot is not letting the steam evaporate, thus losing all essential vitamins and nutrients from the food you're cooking. Instead, all steam is sent back into the food, making it not only a lot more delicious, but richer in nutrients. Apart from the fact that clay cooking is healthier for us, it's also healthier for the environment. First, the clay is not mined, so the land is not stripped or damaged in any way, Secondly, manufacturing clay pots boils down to hard working potters throwing them on the wheel, so not much energy or resources are wasted in the process. Last, but not least, they can last you a lifetime, but even if they don't, they're 100% biodegradable. Cooking in clay also involves using little to no fat or oil. The vessels are non-stick because of all the steam being kept inside and the food releasing its own, natural juices. It works great for vegans, but anyone should enjoy food without any fats and oils. Now, as far as convenience goes, clay cookware is quite versatile. This means you can use the same pot to make tons of dishes, whether they are cooked in the oven or on stove-top. You can bake, grill, fry, braise, whatever you want with the same clay pot. Pros of clay pots The only disadvantage of clay cookware is that it can get a little pricey. If you're going for the 100 % pure clay, unglazed, real thing, which you definitely should, then you can expect to pay a substantial price. You can use these pots for decades provided of course that you take care of them properly. They're truly the best cookware on the market."},{"instruction":"w do police arrest large, aggressive men?

By the time something is a theory it already has supporting data behind it. In any case, it happens all the time. If you want an example that is right in your face for much of the population let’s look at the statin market. Pfizer’s Lipitor (atorvastatin) was a leader amongst about a dozen statins, but not totally dominant. One of their competitors hypothesized that their statin was more effective at preventing heart attacks than other statins. So they ran a trial to prove their hypothesis. When the results came back they had proven that Lipitor, not their drug, was the most effective at preventing heart attacks. That instantly made Lipitor the dominant statin, because how could a doctor or insurance company favor a drug that was less effective at doing the thing it was most intended to do? Even if another drug was equally as good at reducing LDL cholesterol, or better, unless it did a better job at actually reducing heart attacks why would you use it? Note: some people are still prescribed other statins because they have worse side effects from atorvastatin, or it doesn’t work as well on them as the general population for reducing cholesterol, or they didn’t have insurance and wanted a cheaper option before the Lipitor patents expired, or…. But overall, if you have high cholesterol you will be put on atorvastatin because someone’s hypothesis about their drug’s superior effectiveness ended up proving that it was atorvastatin that was most effective. Oops."},{"instruction":"Whats the craziest thing that's happened to you at work?","output":"I’m a voiceover artist. (Artist is a weird description; I don’t paint or create sculptures. 😂) One job I had was as the voice of artificial intelligence. The client wanted a voice that could create any and all possible responses from a computer. The meeting point was a University campus. I was directed to a lone little outhouse. ‘It’s an anechoic chamber,’ said the client. An anechoic chamber is an utterly soundproof room in which noise doesn’t reverberate. You can’t hear anything outside, and the outside can’t hear you. Everything goes dead, and the silence is deafening and odd. You can hear your own heartbeat. Sometimes, people even lose their balance or start to hallucinate if they’re in there long enough. As soon as he locked the door behind me, my pulse rate increased. I thought, ‘No one on this campus knows I’m in here, and they can’t hear a sound from inside…not even a chainsaw.’ 😂 As if that wasn’t creepy enough, he then sat me in a wooden chair in front of a microphone and a monitor (all normal so far) but then he tied my wrists to the armrests! Oooh, that’s new. He explained it was because they wanted no slight movements or increased energy to interfere with the vocals. Everything had to remain even. Erm… My mind was scrambling for all the hacks I’d learned from YouTube videos. ‘How to slide out from zip ties etc’ I thought ‘Wow. I’m gonna die on a university campus, in plain sight. A mop and a few bottles of bleach and no one will ever even know there was a murder victim in this chamber.’ But, it turned out to be a legit job. (I had faith in my agent.) I sat, tied to that chair, for SIX hours (with breaks,) regurgitating every letter, combination of letters, every word, every sentence and inflection known to man.

It allows you to take control of your diet, cook healthier meals, save money, and impress your friends and family. If you're new to cooking, it can be a daunting task. However, with a little bit of guidance and practice, you can become a confident and skilled cook in no time. 1. Start with the basics: Before you dive into complex recipes, it's essential to learn the basics. Learn how to boil pasta, cook rice, fry an egg, and make a simple sandwich. These simple tasks will help you develop essential cooking skills, such as sautéing, boiling, and frying. 2. Invest in quality equipment: Cooking is much easier when you have the right tools. Invest in a good set of knives, a cutting board, measuring cups, and spoons, and a few good quality pots and pans. These tools will make cooking much more manageable and enjoyable. 3. Follow recipes: When you're starting, it's best to follow recipes to the letter. Choose recipes that are easy to follow, and don't require too many ingredients or complicated techniques. As you gain confidence, you can start experimenting with your recipes, but it's best to start with the basics. 4. Learn cooking techniques: Cooking is all about techniques. Learn how to sauté, braise, roast, grill, and bake. Each technique requires different cooking methods, and learning them will help you become a more versatile cook. 5. Learn about ingredients: Understanding ingredients is essential for good cooking. Learn about different herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars. Learn how to pair ingredients and how to use them in different dishes. 6. Practice, practice, practice: Like any skill, cooking requires practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, and don't be discouraged if your first few attempts don't turn out as expected. Keep practicing, and you'll develop your cooking skills over time. 7. Join a cooking class: If you want to take your cooking to the next level, consider joining a cooking class. Cooking classes allow you to learn from experienced chefs, and they provide an opportunity to try out new recipes and techniques. 8. Watch cooking shows: Watching cooking shows is an excellent way to learn new recipes and techniques. There are many cooking shows available online or on TV, and they provide an excellent source of inspiration and education. 9. Cook with others: Cooking with others is a fun and social way to learn how to cook. Invite friends over for a cooking party, or join a cooking club or group. Cooking with others allows you to share ideas and learn from each other. 10. Have fun: Cooking should be fun and enjoyable. Don't stress too much about getting everything perfect or making the perfect dish. Enjoy the process, and remember that cooking is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. In conclusion, learning to cook takes time, patience, and practice. Start with the basics, invest in quality equipment, follow recipes, learn cooking techniques, and experiment with ingredients. Join a cooking class, watch cooking shows, cook with others, and most importantly, have fun. With these tips, you'll be on your way to becoming a confident and skilled cook in no time.

The barn used to be red colored. Is there a specific barn red color that was used in the early 1900s? Why did they use red anyway?","output":"By the early 1900s, red paint was commonly available. In decades prior, it was often made on the farm. Whatever is bring marketed as ‘barn red' will work well enough. Sometimes you'll see a ‘colonial red', which would also work. Expect whatever you use to fade rapidly in the sunlight. You may wish to go a tad dark so it fades to what you want after a few years and won't be too pink by the time it's due for a repainting."},{"instruction":"Hindi language meant to unite Indians or to trigger Indians?","output":"One can’t generalize whether Hindi language is meant to unite Indians or trigger Indians. It is just a truth that we live in a nation named India with known boundaries and those people living in that specific area are Indians. People can seek life anywhere in the nation. And it also happens Hindi is spoken by the majority of the persons in the country. In States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha etc. they have a local languages. But people in these areas understand Hindi. Even in Bangalore, anyone in the road understands Hindi. The humans have the need to communicate. Why not do the same in the language known to people? Hating the system is not going to help me. Everyone has to live with the system whatever be the way the system is. My opinion is hating Hindi or any language is not going to help me. Finding my way forward is what is important for me. When our country is such that majority of the people know and understand Hindi, better I know speaking Hindi. I can program myself not to be triggered. How people perceive this issue is what matters for them. Politicians are the only persons who benefit by triggering people. Why must we benefit politicians? ‘Work hard and smart in my way forward’ is my motto and not to complain in the system."},{"instruction":"Where has Indian media gone wrong?","output":"She is Suchandrima. A journalist from West Bengal, India. We all know how badly the super cyclone Amphan hit West Bengal and Odisha, the adjacent states of Bay of Bengal. This was possibly the worst storm hit to the state of Bengal in last 300 years. Lakhs of people have lost their last resorts and literally going through the worst time of their life. First the fear of deadly coronavirus, then this terrible terrible cyclone. And there is the lady, reporting from ground zero. There she is one of the few hopes of Journalism in India. Now, just don't tell me that REAL JOURNALISM is vanished from our country because you and me are obsessed with some of the PRIME TIME FACES. Your obsession with some news anchors who think that their place is just after the Prime Minister and Home Minister of this country, does not imply that there aren't any professional who are sticking to their primary ethics even at this time. You can be a stern critic or an admirer of those GIGANTIC NOISE MAKERS, but in both cases you are wasting your time on incorrigible beings who are getting PAID for dividing my country in every possible way. Watch those funny edited videos on youtube, laugh and forget. Lets be clear, That is not journalism. This one is. And I don't care about which news channel she is part of, not interested about which party leader has bought a share of that channel. All I see is an individual who is honest towards her own profession. Also, If you think that this is a publicity stunt, then let it be. If anyone, an org or individual wants to get popular by doing act like this, then we should make them popular. More power to you; Madam and more power to all of those journalists of this country who are sticking at their basics and giving voice to the voiceless, to the downtrodden, to them whose cry are not being heard by our establishments.

The person with the camera in his hand is Kaushik Chatterjee.]"},{"instruction":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test? If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"This kind of scenario did not actually happen to me and a little bit different but my husband had an ex and they’ve been together for 3 yrs so going back when we started our relationship (June 2009) together month after their separation (no formal closure) his ex suddenly made an announcement to his family that she is pregnant (July 2009) and so my agony has begun and my partner confessed that something happened between him and ex etc.. we still continue our relationship despite of the situation and I swallowed all his family’s ill mouthed words and constant bashing towards me since they are strongly in favor of his ex so moving forward the ex girlfriend posted a photo of a newborn april 2010 and his family got excited with so many comments, compliments. They even made the baby boy as their profile picture and met with ex and the baby boy to intentionally hurt me. Fast forward of constant spying, stalking on social media and never-ending social media war December of 2011 I created a dummy account by copying the ex girlfriend’s cousin account and boom! I found out that the boy wasn’t his at all, the baby picture with his true parents during baptism and 1st birthday he also had an electronic invitation all relatives tagged including the nasty ex girlfriend I found out the baby boy is her nephew after all. I exposed all of them on fb the baby boy really looks like his true father! so imagine the emotional damage that my in-laws caused towards me? from 2009 up until now it’s already damaged and i’m not comfy enough to share my life with them. No apologies made from them. 2012 - the sister of ex girlfriend confessed to my bf (now husband) that ex gf had a miscarriage 2014 - we got married and i’m still not comfy with my in laws From the beginning my husband don’t have any special bond or feeling that he is the father."},{"instruction":"Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?","output":"Democrats are not ‘afraid’ of Christians. REAL ‘Christians’ do NOT inflict blunt force trauma on others with the Cross, that is exactly the opposite of what the Church actually teaches. Nor do REAL ‘Christians’ attempt to force THEIR religious beliefs down the throats of others via governments or schools (although they feel free to say exactly the same thing about others when others simply seek to live their lives in peace and happiness). You are free to practice your faith as you see fit. You are NOT, however, permitted to judge me because I am Catholic, because I do not attend YOUR Church, because I do not practice according to your dictates. Nor may you impose your belief on me or my company via your business decisions. Where I attend Church, which Church, and who my circle of friends are, are NOT deciding factors in how I conduct business. If those are the benchmarks you use to decide where to do business, stay where you are, do not leave your County and do not interact with the rest of the world. We had millennia of of religious oppression in its varying forms, and no longer tolerate that bigotry. You are NOT the Holy Inquisition, and you never will be.

What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"At an IQ of 150. Individuals may share enough in common with peers that socially and emotionally they may still fit in on the surface, but many will feel internally out of synch, as they go through the motions, they are usually socially indifferent and hold back a lot. Children at this IQ level are far ahead of age peers. For example, a chronological six-year-old will be four years ahead intellectually, and a ten-year-old, seven years ahead. This lead is maintained throughout ones’ life. However a young student of an IQ of 150+ is usually naive to the faulty logic that the majority adopts to run its society. There is the phenomenon of herd behavior and escape panic that such individuals have to get around. The tiring sense of being bogged down by the inertia and lack of understanding and want to understand in people, they just want you to confirm their own prejudiced beliefs to them, garner them “status”. “ I spoke to an IQ 150 today and he agrees that there’s not much truth to the communication barrier.” Obviously it is a matter of not stressing the bandwidth and fidelity of the connection by communicating adequately and not over their heads, it is usually impolite to insist such things, even if they are true. Our society thinks in labels and roles. Finally, never be fooled by their education or their talents ...... They don't know how to apply their learning to themselves or others once removed from their roles & labels. Remember. they live and \\"think\\" through labels and are incapable of perceiving reality clearly. This means that you can get them to jump through hoops by simply manipulating their labels ...... If you find them doing something which interferes with your plans. simply \\"throw\\" them a tasty label and watch them munch their way through it. I’ve been pointing this out for years, if you recall. But because I don’t think like the less intelligent, I am regularly labeled everything from stupid to “elitist”. In my experience, the 150 IQ individual does not resent the individual with the 160 or the 175 IQ, and this may be because being above 145, we all tend to engage in similar thought processes or more likely possess asymptotically similar values [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #xpsfU], albeit with different capabilities. The 135 IQ individual dislikes and fears the 150+ individuals, while the 115 IQ individual either doesn’t believe the 150+ individuals exist or blithely insists that they are crazy, failures or somehow defective.As Sergio Carvajal said: 1. To pursue credentials in academic institutions, specifically to get hold of (and then flaunt) what they consider to be socially sanctioned proof of their intelligence. These people actually want honorifics, letters after their names and to dress in bat capes at conventions of like-minded people. 2. These people are unoriginal, although appearing creative and original to others is extremely important to them. In the field of literature they become adept at churning out fairly technically proficient pastiche and barely disguised fan-fiction, while they can look convincingly creative to people less intelligent than them. 3. They are very, very aware of the small gap in intellect that exists between themselves and the mean, and this is a significant part of their identity, and they react viciously to any attacks on it. Try to attack credentialism or the university system’s farcical monopoly of all gainful intellectual employment in front of one of these people and witness their reaction. Better yet, just question their intelligence. 4. They have a tendency to worship at the altar of intellectual authority. The idea of an ‘expert’ appeals immensely to these people. They find someone who they consider to be highly intelligent and then delegate all their thinking to that person. This comes with the tendency to wield the wiffle bat of the appeal to authority at every opportunity. 5. Consensus reality as dictated by experts is something they feel compelled to defend. They are frequently people of the system, for the system and in defense of the system. Ironically they tend to see themselves as rugged skeptics when they are incapable of interrogating anything fed to them from the intellectual mainstream. 6. They have no concept of the limits of intellect, or a sense of intellectual humility. Intelligence recognizes that whatever it does know is eclipsed by what it doesn’t know, which leads to both humility and open mindedness. Midwittery tends to focus exclusively on what it knows, and believes that this imparts expertise and authority in unrelated fields (witness Dawkins). 7. They cannot accept anecdotes, people that violate their implicit “rules” about the kind of journey that is required for mature mastery of a demanding field. But the fact of such extraordinary accomplishments must not be denied. It doesn’t alienate them from most others though because of the rarity of the profoundly gifted. I’d bet that as much as academia would tend to exclude these people, they’re also unlikely to have an interest in being part of academia. Intelligent people want to have intellectual engagement with people of similar intelligence to themselves, and they’re unlikely to find that in the dusty cloisters of academia. Being away from that kind of group environment also allows for unencumbered creativity. Occupation can have a kind of socialization process that 95% of people in the human population cannot resist. People who work very hard and spend years in order to climb to what they regard as the pinnacle of achievement actively resent those who can simply leap up to the peak. And because their knowledge is hard won, they tend to cling to it much more tenaciously than the more intelligent individual who is no more tied to one piece of information than the next. What makes it worse is that they cannot fathom that the more intelligent individuals do not think like they do. In [LINKED_TEXT: A Parable of Talents] [URL: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/], Scott Alexander wrote: IQ is so important for intellectual pursuits that eminent scientists in some fields have average IQs around 150 to 160. Since IQ this high only appears in 1/10,000 people or so, it beggars coincidence to believe this represents anything but a very strong filter for IQ (or something correlated with it) in reaching that level. If you saw a group of dozens of people who were 7’0 tall on average, you’d assume it was a basketball team or some other group selected for height, not a bunch of botanists who were all very tall by coincidence.

Abortion is a highly disputed issue among libertarians. Makes sense too: libertarians are deeply concerned with rights. The question among libertarians is: when do rights begin? Conception? Birth? Somewhere in between? —Somewhere after birth, sometimes people philosophize? This is a really hard, value-based edge question without objective answer. The boundaries of rights are fuzzy. And libertarians can easily disagree. For example, I’m generally against abortion. In theory. But it’s really none of my business. I can’t have an abortion. On the other hand, I do not support laws which try to regulate it and prevent it. Regardless of what I think is “good”, I have no right or interest to use force and coercion (or ask the State to do it on my behalf) to stop anyone from seeking an abortion. I believe in other people’s rights to choose. —Other libertarians would say, “So long as those choices don’t hurt other people!” And so we begin another round: “Is a fetus a person which holds rights?” I say no. But others might disagree. Years ago, I had an office that overlooked a Planned Parenthood clinic across the street. There would very often be several protesters out there, walking up and down the sidewalk for most of the day. I don’t think they ever convinced anyone to leave. Sometimes, I would do the mental math: 8 protesters, times 6 hours per day, times 15 per hour… yields about 3,600 per week.

When selecting an HVAC system, there are several factors to consider that will cater to the needs of your pets. First and foremost, it's crucial to choose an HVAC system with efficient air filtration. Pets can shed hair and dander, which can circulate in the air and trigger allergies or respiratory issues. Look for HVAC systems with high-quality filters that can capture pet allergens effectively. Another consideration is the noise level of the HVAC system. Some pets may be sensitive to loud noises, so opting for a system with quieter operation can help keep them calm and reduce stress. Temperature control is also essential. Pets are sensitive to extreme temperatures, so selecting an HVAC system that provides precise temperature regulation will help maintain a comfortable environment for your furry friends. Energy efficiency is another factor to keep in mind. Energy-efficient HVAC systems not only save you money on your utility bills but also minimize your carbon footprint. Look for systems with high energy efficiency ratings to ensure you're being environmentally conscious. For more detailed information and expert advice on selecting a pet-friendly HVAC system, I recommend checking out the Quora post at [LINKED_TEXT: How to Choose a Pet-Friendly HVAC System] [URL: https://homeimprovementandmaintenanceresourcehub.quora.com/How-to-Choose-a-Pet-Friendly-HVAC-System?ch=10&oid=109737166&share=4b782aed&srid=hE7bzb&target_type=post]."},{"instruction":"Should we use “audience was/were” clapping?","output":"Audience is a countable noun..

The fields which are invisible to us get intensified gradually and intensity decreases gradually around the antenna. This forms kind of concentric circles of fields around the antennas(assuming isotropic antennas). Now, whenever the receiving antenna comes under the influence of this antenna, the required data is transferred depending upon the frequency at which the intensities are changing and the type of encoding. The first picture depicts fields propagating. The second picture depicts the pattern of the field.

Amazon and Alibaba are two different ecommerce platform. The former is for B2C, while the other one is for B2B.

Alibaba is based in China, most of the sellers on Alibaba are from China. In that case, you will find sometimes it’s hard to communicate with them. However, the price of products on it are much cheaper, and you must buy with MOQ. The products on Amazon has been “selected” by the sellers, and Amazon itself pay more attention to brand registry.

Even on the third floor you could smell when they brought in a body pulled out of the river. The morgue also had a “decomp freezer” to store bodies that were really bad. Bodies going in and out of this freezer were memorable. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Delaware Museum of Natural History’s “skeletonization” room. It had plastic tubs with rotting animal carcasses (deer, etc.) covered with Carrion Beetles, turning the rotting corpses into skeletons. The tubs were only covered with screens to keep the beetles in. Truly a foul experience. I inspected a vacant office building in Washington DC that had a homeless girl living in it. Every day or so she went to the floor above the one she lived on and shit on the concrete slab. Every single day she moved over about 18″ and left another steaming pile.

For one thing there is word of mouth!! Bad news travels fast and in most cases the restaurants in the best locations have the highest prices and the worst paid staff. I eventually use something called the senses. Looking around at a number of eateries, is there rubbish or trash strewn everywhere or is it reasonably clean? Now how about who is in there already, my usual trick is to see if there are any locals eating there. Some establishments have to rely a great deal on repeat trade from workers of all sorts nearby so their reputation is vital to them rather than the money they can spend on a big sign. My choice is to avoid particularly such places that are only branches of a multi national, why bother going abroad and eating almost exactly the same as one might get at home? FWIW, I contribute occasionally to Trip Advisor and this can be quite useful for finding some nice little places off the beaten track. But there always seem to be a few reviews that are totally opposite of my experience in these places.

SPEED: I’ll start with speed first cause speed is one of the most important thing in this battle. In terms of speed Tobirama was able to outspeed KCM Minato. He basically comes out of nowhere, grabs the truth seeking orb before Minato could (even tho Minato was closer) and teleports it back to Juubito and blows him up. Now you can definitely make the argument that Minato was mentally nerfed or dazed but Minato even with that same “daze” was able to outspeed MKCM Naruto and EMS sasuke so bad that they don’t even realize until he appeared in front of them. The same EMS Sasuke who was stated to be equel to Itachi. Speed scaling: Tobirama>Dazed Kcm Minato>Ems Sasuke=Itachi Tobirama can literally speedblitz Itachi before Itachi can even blink in theory. (There are also other speed scaling for Tobirama but I’ll stick with this one) Now speed is not the only thing right? Attack potency plays a huge part cause Tobirama can be faster but he cannot damage Itachi if he doesn’t have the AP. So now let’s talk about AP. If we’re using Edo Tobirama then he has a jutsu called the tandem paper bomb technique. This is an ancillary jutsu for the edo tensei that he did not get to use against the Gold and Silver brothers. Tobirama’s tandem paper bomb technique was able to annihilate Hashirama’s largest and strongest deity gate. As a reminder a weaker version of these deity gates were able to pin down the Juubi and can also tank the Juubi’s explosions. Without his paper bombs, 1 Rinnegan Sage Mode Madara absolutely refuses to let tobirama to touch him at all, even resorting to the Susanoo to defend himself😭💀. He also has a jutsu called the “Fresh water blade” which is implied to have either durability negation or high levels of AP. So Tobirama has the speed to beat up Itachi, he has the AP to damage Itachi and overall Tobirama just stomps. Itachi fans I’m sorry ok.

We have a bunch of different frameworks/tools that managers expect a person to magically be a master at. If they don't know they will ASSUME you are a bad developer. A person has to either be using the tools since they were a child or be a toxically obsessed in learning new software tools if they want to master said tools. Just to make t clear I'll bullet down why it's hard: Learning each tool/programming language: is hardSpending time to make projects so you can CONVINCE them you can do the job: is hardHaving social work experience to show you can handle a software team’s passive aggressive tone: is hard (for example working at fast food).Being able to stay calm when they ask stupid questions that most computer science majors are required to know by graduation: is hard. For real, you can fail an interview just because you failed to provide a clear definition of Object Oriented programming. All my projects use OOP, but stutter once, and watch them lose faith in you on the spot. OOP is an intro CS topic required for one's entire CS curriculum, wtf is it even a question?! Maybe they are entered industry at a time where it wasn't a big deal but I don't know.To make it worst the reason why potential employers are so choosy is because there exists bad developers, like REALLY bad developers that somehow got a job. You ask yourself how they even graduated when they barely know how to program. Basically interviewers are really really scared, literally SCARED they are gonna hire a bad developer, making them super choosy.Lack of social skills. I don't mean to be rude or discriminatory, but I feel, I FEEL, that a lot of developers lack proper social skills. This plays a role with their ability to seek out good candidates. They have don't enough insight on how to talk to a person to know if they can make a good developer.Passive aggressiveness. Again, industry is toxic. Sometimes I feel like maybe one of my colleagues is trying to sabotage me and make me look bad. If they feel you are not doing enough good work you can hear it in their voice.Its high in demand because it's hard to learn, it's hard to get a job because industry is toxic. I will only recommend this field if one really values income and NEED that income. I'm greatful for having the job.

Really. I wore them a lot in their earlier incarnation. They fit really well, and I loved them. As they wore out, I patched them, and patched them some more. They were a rainbow of fabric and lace and leather and embroidery. My friend J loved my jeans. He always admired me in them, and noticed when a new patch was added. He even contributed some lovely fabric bits. When I was done wearing those jeans, I created another life for them: I made them into a sculpture. I hung them from a post in the shop where I worked, and filled them with expanding foam (urea formaldehyde, maybe? I don’t actually remember.) The foam completely filled them, and held the folds in the fabric perfectly. I left the button undone and the zipper open a little, just because. And then I painted them with clear resin. I did several coats, so they’d be really sturdy. To finish my piece, I poured acetone into them, which dissolved the foam. Et, voila! A standing-up pair of awesome jeans. I gave them to J for a house-warming gift. He was really happy, and made everyone who came over take a look. I was thrilled that he liked them so much. I wasn’t sure if it was just too freakish or not. It wasn’t. J has been gone a long time, lost to AIDS.

Animal sacrifices were an element of India's old Vedic religion, according to books like the Yajurveda. Bali is a Sanskrit phrase for animal sacrifice that means \\"tribute, offering, or oblation\\" in general. Bali is sometimes referred to as Jhatka Bali among Hindus, and \\"refers to the blood of an animal. The Ashvamedha, a Vedic ceremony in which a horse was permitted to ride freely for a year before being sacrificed, is recorded in the Yajurveda. Yudhishtra, the Chakravartin emperor, performs the Ashwamedha after winning the Kurukshetra war in the epic Mahabharata.There is also a narrative of an Ashvamedha conducted by the Chedi king Uparichara Vasu in the Mahabharata, but no animals were killed in this storey.Sacrifices, on the other hand, were common in this ceremony.

There are only two ways to do this. 1. Elimination of the second amendment by a constitutional amendment. Taking away the second amendment is a function of political mathematics. A constitutional amendment requires a super majority of 2/3rds of both chambers of congress and a 2/3rds majority of states to ratify it. These measures to limit the second amendment or criticizing it’s supporters are posted because those posting them know that they are nowhere close to having the votes to take completely take away the second amendment, in fact the political math is in fact working against taking away the second amendment. There are now more states that allow concealed carry than ever before, more than half of the states now allow concealed carry without a permit, they are obviously pro second amendment. A two thirds majority of states 34 would be needed to ratify a repeal of the second amendment, in other words only 16 could oppose it. 2. Use the political organs of the state (The Federal Government) justified with state propaganda (leftwing controlled mainstream media) to ignore and de-facto overturn the US Constitution, eliminate the supporters of the second amendment, thereby establishing one party rule in the newly formed “People’s Republic of the United States”.

Now, one of the North Indians sitting near them protested saying that people should speak “normal” languages only otherwise how will other people understand. Now, I have sooooooo many problems with this statement. on what basis can we call Telugu as an “abnormal” language? Shouldn’t it also be spoken? Same way how Marathi people make Hindustani people feel at home in Maharashtra so too do Kannadigas make Telugu people feel at home in Karnataka. How can you say one is normal and other should not be socially acceptable?Do Hindustani people follow the same rule? Will they switch to English if in a given context Hindi is not qualified as a “normal” language? I know the answer to this question and so does everyone else. There is no point in repeating a point which has been made ad nauseam.Isn’t this convenient for Hindustani people? Their language is considered as “normal”. So, basically, they never have to learn a language outside of school, never have to learn how hard it is to learn a language. Later on some of the same people will insult and laugh at people who try to speak in Hindi to try to be one with them. The problem with this language being the unifying language is that some North Indians, to use American language, blissfully bask in their North Indian privilege never even realising that other people adjust and speak to them in Hindi at every turn.

And if the search engine decides the page will be useful to the user, it will display it higher in search results. Keyword optimization: Conduct keyword research to identify relevant and high-value keywords that your target audience is searching for. Incorporate these keywords naturally into the page's title tag, headings, meta description, URL, and throughout the content. High-quality content: Create unique, informative, and engaging content that satisfies the user's search intent. Ensure the content is well-structured, properly formatted with headings, and contains relevant keywords naturally. Use descriptive and enticing meta descriptions to improve click-through rates from search results. Title tags: Craft compelling and descriptive title tags that accurately summarize the content of the page. Include relevant keywords and keep the title tag within the recommended length limit (around 50-60 characters) to ensure it is fully displayed in search results. Meta descriptions: Write concise and persuasive meta descriptions that provide a preview of the page's content. Although meta descriptions do not directly impact rankings, they can influence click-through rates. Include relevant keywords and maintain a length of around 150-160 characters. URL structure: Use descriptive and SEO-friendly URLs that clearly indicate the page's content. Include relevant keywords in the URL, separate words with hyphens, and keep it concise and meaningful. Header tags (H1, H2, etc.): Use header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure your content and signal the importance of different sections. Include relevant keywords in your headings to provide search engines with an understanding of the page's content hierarchy. Image optimization: Optimize images by compressing their file size without compromising quality. Use descriptive filenames and alt text to provide search engines with context about the image content.

However i find that it is none of the Supremes Courts Business who bursts crackers and who does not. The SC is nobody to tell anyone to stop bursting crackers. They have gone too far with their insane orders since 2015. The SC are not democratically elected by the people. They are a bunch of judges who have zero idea of culture and traditions of different people. It is the politicians and the elected representatives who should make the decision to outlaw the production of crackers NOT THE SUPREME COURT. First of all this PIL business has to stop. SC entertains insane PILS - and actually pass ridiculous orders - like cracker bursting, cracker sales etc when it is not their job or their business. If Delhi has pollution - it is the State Government and Central Governments Job to see that the pollution is handled. If they outlaw crackers - that is their decision since they have been elected to power by the common man and if common man feels that this decision is bad - he will express his anger through the vote at the next election . That is how democracy works. Yet the SC judges are selected by a random collegium who have zero business with common man - so in reality the SC decision looks like decisions of a dictator as there are no checks and balances on their insanity. For instance - if PM Modi makes a decision like demonetization and people are unhappy - they vote BJP out of power, but how can the people handle the SC? Who handles the SC? Nobody. IN the past the SC handled the power well - Judges like Lodha or Katju knew their powers and responsibility and their decisions were hugely respected. Their decision to outlaw sunfilm was so beautifully implemented throughout the country yet - the newer breed of SC judges like Thakur, Mishra or Gogoi have trounced on this respect with some extremely atrocious decisions like Jallikattu, Sabarimala or Crackers because of which people are actually openly defying the orders. In my neighborhood children burst crackers from 6 PM - 11 PM and cops comfortably travelling on the road did not spend a second in reprimanding them or telling them to stop. They stopped at 11 PM. So - to summarize- only the democratically elected government can make such decisions since there are checks and balances and decisions can always be judged by their performance in thenext elections. Likewise another horror is Rafale where a desperate has been loser Mr Shourie creates mischief and the current king of losers Rahul gandhi creates a ruckus and suddenly rather than throwing out the entire issue - the illustrious bench of the SC compromises our air force and defence by handling this insanity. The SC are becoming Keystone Judges (Except Justices Sikri, Nariman and Chandrachud, Malhotra of course)"},{"instruction":"Why is MCU phase 4 looking so aimless and too divergent?","output":"You are assuming that Phases 1–3 were well planned out. Were they really? Or did Marvel just do a great job of retconning everything at the right moments to make it seem like there was a plan that never actually existed? Actually the latter is the real truth. There was never a master plan. The Tesseract and Loki's staff were retroactively turned into Infinity Stones, Thanos was added at the end of the first Avengers film at the last minute before release simply because Joss Wheedon loves the character, to everyone, including Kevin Feige, the sudden appearance of Thanos in the story was a huge surprise, at the time no one had any idea of the last minute inclusion of Thanos, this became a moment of crisis “what the hell are we going to do with THIS?” There was so little planning that they actually included the Infinity Gauntlet in the background in the first Thor movie as an Easter egg for the hard core fans, the reasoning being “there is no possible way we are ever going to actually do the Infinity Gauntlet story so let's just toss this in the background for fun.”. Little did they know that only a few short years later, that simple two second Easter egg would become a major crisis and necessitate a major retcon in Thor Ragnarok. This never would have been necessary if they had a plan from the beginning. In addition, several of the post credits scenes were never really paid off, or were quickly cast aside in the sequel without being addressed. The end credits scene in The Incredible Hulk was actually retconned away by a Marvel one shot a couple years later. And it is difficult not to notice the repeated back and forth on whether Iron Man would be a member of the Avengers or not. Iron Man 1 has Fury approaching Stark, then The Incredible Hulk has Stark fully on board trying to recruit other members for the team only for us to be told in Iron Man 2! that Natasha has been sent to see if Stark is good enough for the team that he was supposedly already recruited for at the end of the first movie. If SHIELD is still evaluating him, why did Fury approach Stark in the first place? Similarly, if Loki's staff is an Infinity Stone, why did Thanos give it up to get a different stone if his plan all along was to collect all 6? If you're honest, you'll have to admit that none of this makes a lick of sense, it only seems otherwise because Marvel has a gift for well timed retcons to try to make incoherent stories seem to make sense retroactively, provided you don't examine the details too closely"},{"instruction":"Where do you find the crowd for crowdfunding campaigns?","output":"Crowdfunding campaigns are fundraising efforts that are typically conducted online and involve a large number of people contributing small amounts of money to support a particular project, product, or cause.

I got the real backstory only very recently and here is it: A Taiwanese model who featured in a cosmetic surgery advert in 2012, for a clinic and ad agency was left in misery, with her career coming to a standstill after the ad became a popular internet meme. If you remember any version of the meme, it had this same caption in different languages: “Plastic surgery - you can't hide it forever.\\" Her ordeal began in 2012 with a photo shoot for an advertisement aimed at convincing people to get plastic surgery at a Taiwanese cosmetic clinic. The photo showed very attractive \\"parents\\" with sought-after big eyes and long, well-defined noses, and their three \\"children\\", whose images were altered to make their eyes look exceptionally small and their noses flat. The caption read: \\"The only thing you'll ever have to worry about is how to explain it to the kids.\\" Ms Yeh stated that her contract, signed by her agency and the Taipei office of US-based international advertising agency J Walter Thompson (JWT), was clear that the ad would be used in newspapers and magazines, by that clinic only. But JWT later allowed another plastic surgery clinic, Simple Beauty, to use it on its website; it also put the image on JWT's Facebook page. Before long, the photo made its way across the internet, with a new caption: \\"Plastic surgery - you can't hide it forever.\\" Then in 2012, a Chinese tabloid attached it to a fake story - which [LINKED_TEXT: first emerged in 2004] [URL: http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/95896.htm] - about a husband from Heilongjiang who sued his wife when he found out she had plastic surgery before they met, because their children grew up to look nothing like her.

Cardano's method is a formula for finding the roots of a cubic equation. The general form of a cubic equation is: ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 To solve this equation using Cardano's method, we need to transform it into a simpler form: x³ + px + q = 0 where p and q are constants. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get: x³ - (3/4)x - (1/8) = 0 Next, we need to find the values of p and q. We can do this by using the following formulas: p = (3ac - b²) / 3a² q = (2b³ - 9abc + 27a²d) / 27a³ where a, b, c, and d are the coefficients of the cubic equation. Substituting the values, we get: a = 1, b = 0, c = -3/4, and d = -1/8 p = (3 x 1 x (-3/4) - 0²) / (3 x 1²) = -1/2 q = (2 x 0³ - 9 x 1 x (-3/4) x (-1/8) + 27 x 1² x (-1/8)) / 27 = -1/64 Now we need to use Cardano's formula to find the roots of the equation: x = (u + v) - b / 3a where u = (q + √(q² + 4p³/27))^(1/3) v = (q - √(q² + 4p³/27))^(1/3) Substituting the values, we get: u = (-1/64 + √((-1/64)² + 4(-1/2)³/27))^(1/3) v = (-1/64 - √((-1/64)² + 4(-1/2)³/27))^(1/3) Simplifying the expressions, we get: u = (-1/64 + √(13/1728))^(1/3) v = (-1/64 - √(13/1728))^(1/3) u ≈ 0.5874 v ≈ -1.1748 Substituting these values into the formula for x, we get: x1 = u + v ≈ -0.4173 x2 = -(u + v)/2 + i√3/2(u - v) ≈ 0.2991 + 0.5198i x3 = -(u + v)/2 - i√3/2(u - v) ≈ 0.2991 - 0.5198i Therefore, the solutions of the equation 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 are approximately: x1 ≈ -0.4173 x2 ≈ 0.2991 + 0.5198i x3 ≈ 0.2991 - 0.5198i Note that the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, so x2 and x3 are complex conjugates of each other"},{"instruction":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","output":"Well, sort of.

IMO … the 1969–74 era is the period you want to look at - the heyday of both bands. The Stones: In the 1969–74 period, right as the ‘rock world’ was moving into a strongly virtuoistic-player era … The Rolling Stones were ‘right there’ in the forefront with the addition of the great ‘British Bluesman’ Mick Taylor. I saw them twice in this period … and their live performance was stirring and wonderfully musical as well - top notch (even though Jagger has never been accused of being a good singer, or even a guy who carries a tune all that well - he goes flat a lot in the higher register). In the Mick Taylor years, the Stones put out IMO their best albums. 1969: the live Get Yer Ya Ya’s Out (Platinum, Best songs: Jumpin Jack Flash, Street Fighting Man)1969: Let It Bleed (2X Platinum) Best songs: Gimme Shelter, Let It Bleed, You Can't Always Get What You Want1971: my favorte Stones album, the great Sticky Fingers (4X Platinum) Best songs: pretty much all of them - Brown Sugar, Sway, Wild Horses, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Bitch, Sister Morphine, Dead Flowers, Moonlight Mile1972: Exlie on Main Street (Platinum) Best songs: Tumbling Dice, Happy, All Down The Line1973: Goat's Head Soup (4X Platinum) Best song: Angie1974: It's Only Rock and Roll (Platinum) Best song: the title track Additionally Mick Taylor crafted a new lead solo riff for 1968's “Steet Fighting Man” that helped make the '69 Git Your Ya Ya's Out tour a huge success. Did You Know? Mick Taylor came to the Stones from the iconic British blues band, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. (Do you know how he got into the Bluesbreakers? In 1965, at age 16, Taylor went to see The Bluesbreakers performance at \\"The Hop,” Welwyn Garden City. And for some reason, their guitarist, some guy named Eric Clapton, was a no-show. After a song or two, seeing that Clapton hadn't appeared, but that his guitar was up there, all set up, on the stage, Taylor approached John Mayall during the break to ask if he could play with them. Taylor mentioned that he was familiar with the band's repertoire, and after a moment of deliberation, Mayall said okay. Taylor later said, \\"I wasn't thinking that this was a great opportunity ...\\" This encounter, however, proved to be pivotal in Taylor's career when Mayall, a year later, needed someone to replace Clapton’s successor-guitarist in the band, Peter Green, when Green quit to form Fleetwood Mac. Mayall placed a 'Guitarist Wanted' advert in the weekly Melody Maker music paper, and — to his great relief, Mayall later said, Taylor showed up for a tryout … none was necessary. So spring ‘67, he became a Bluesbreaker) (All Down The Line, live in 1972) ============== The Who In the 1969–73 period, they put out just three albums, but what albums they were: 1969: the great Tommy (2X Platinum. Best songs: all of them ... all great songs except “Uncle Ernie”) 1070: the great Live at Leeds (2X Platinum) Best Songs: Substitiute, Summer Time Blues, My Generation, Magic Bus. 1971: Who’s Next (3X Platinum. Best songs: Baba O'Riley, Bargain, The Song Is Over, Going Mobile, Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get Fooled Again) 1973: Quadrophenia (Platinum. Best Song: Love, Reign o’er Me) =============== So, who was better? I saw them both in this period, in 1969. The Who concert (in a small venue in Detroit, about 1500 or so) was probably the best concert I’ve ever seen - they played the whole Tommy album, then “My Generation” for an encore. Pete Townshend sounding like two guitars at once, playing lead and rhythm at the same time. John Entwistle - similarly, sounding like two, playing chords on the bass. Keith Moon - sounding like three. The 6–7 Pete Townshend doing his windmills and leaps. Roger Daltrey tossing the microphone around. The Stones, Olympia Stadium, Detroit. The Get Yer Ya Ya’s Out tour. Mick Jagger is the consumate showman. And with the wonderful Mick Taylor up there, the Stones were a virtuosic band as well. Their new version of “Street FIghting Man” with Taylor’s guitar playing was something special. And Jumping Jack Flash - Mick in his Uncle Sam top had, and scarf, was unforgettable. To me, both were magnificant live … the quality of Pete Townshend’s songwriting talent is what stands out more to me, however. Jagger/Richards is an elite songwriting team … but Townshend was/is something special in that regard, IMO. His songs were beautiful, so the live performances were highly musical as well as exciting and dramatic. I give it by a slim margin to … The Who.

The feed will be the ocean and sewerage. In the long term the administration can reduce water supply losses (during transporting to customer) to less then 10% instead of being near 50% right now, right there water available to customer goes up by a solid 100%.Put a cost of water per 1000 ltr. which will be charged with respect to the income of every household, this is important to fund water for those who have no money, and to teach people to learn to respect water.Make a water plan which increases water reservoirs and does actual watershed management in and near Chennai area. I am sure that proposals for all of the above are pending with the administration, and they can also get the money from the state and central government. The people have to wake up the politicians and administrators through mass agitation, and make it clear that till the water problem is not solved, nothing will move in Chennai and nearby areas, only such actions move them, otherwise they will wait for the monsoons and leave the problem for next year.

This can include preparing sales forecasts to decide how to organize employees better to increase efficiency. All a business analyst needs is an in-depth knowledge of the subject, excellent problem-solving skills, management experience, and the ability to communicate his or her ideas persuasively. There are no strict educational requirements for those looking into this career path, though a background in accounting or law may be helpful depending on the position within an organization that is sought out. Responsibilities of Business Analyst: As a business analyst, one might have to make presentations to senior managers as well as the board of directors.Good public speaking skills are thus a must.A person in this position also needs to be able to think on his or her feet and quickly come up with problem-solving strategies.This comes especially in handy when working for fast-paced companies that need to constantly keep a close eye on the competition, such as information technology firms and large retail chains. Business analysts may work individually or within teams depending on the company's needs. They may even have the opportunity to go overseas when conducting their research, especially if they are working for multinational businesses. To become a business analyst, one must generally have a working knowledge of the subject in question, though that is not always the case. Business analysts are often hired from within organizations that desire an expert on their subject lines. Online resources for BA: Many online institutes provide the best BA courses. Some of the top platforms are: Simplilearn - Business Analytics Simplilearn offers a comprehensive Business Analytics Course for students who wish to add Business Analytics to their existing IT skillset.

Advanced-Data Science and ML course at Learnbay is one of a kind. The best part about Learnbay DS courses is their domain-specialized courses. There is a rise in demand for domain-specialized courses nowadays. Importance of domain-specialized courses: I would strongly advise a working professional to pursue domain-specific training. It is critical because you will be able to master data or business analytics in your chosen career field and develop your career as a result. Specialization in a specific domain, in my opinion, is the most effective way to enhance your career. This type of training not only allows you to develop in your career but also allows you to get experience in a specific field. Employers in high-profile professions nowadays seek applicants that have a focus on domain specialization and have specific competence in their fields. Learnbay's Advanced Data Science and AI Program, which includes a domain specialization option, is ideal for working professionals. This feature is not accessible on other platforms. While studying AI or DS, you can focus on a certain field such as sales, banking, finance, or oil and gas. Conclusion: The role of the Business Analyst is to aid other departments within an organization where they find that planning and analyzing requirements, extracting information from data, and extending or modifying products are very important in completing projects. Learnbay will offer you a unique learning experience, where you will learn programming languages, as well as the concepts behind them. This includes the process of reading and writing code.

Is it really profitable?","output":"Dropshipping is an online business model of selling products without stock. You delegate the storage and logistics duties to the supplier, while you only create a store and attract customers – the model works like that. That’s why your online store is not tied to the warehouse. This is one of the advantages of the dropshipping business model. You don’t need a huge warehouse where products will be stored, and the supplier does most of the job for you: inventory issues, stocking and shipping are not your concern! It turns out that to open a store and start selling, you do not need any production facility or warehouse. All questions of logistics and storage of goods are solved by the supplier, your task is to attract customers and provide them with the opportunity to pay on the website. Of course, for many people, this business model is profitable. They put their energy, time and money there. But dropshipping (like any other business) is not a business for everyone. Before you think about creating your own dropshipping store, it is worth to study the principles of this business model and decide for yourself whether you want/ can do it or not.

Microwave ovens use electromagnetic waves to generate heat, which cooks food quickly and efficiently. There is a common misconception that microwave cooking negatively affects the nutritional value of food, but this is not entirely accurate. Like any cooking method, the impact on nutritional value depends on factors such as cooking time, temperature, and the type of food being prepared. Overcooking or excessive heating can lead to nutrient loss in any cooking process, including microwave cooking. However, when used properly, microwave ovens can help retain the nutrients in food. Microwaves cook food by generating heat directly within the food itself, rather than through the heating elements or hot air in conventional ovens. This shorter cooking time and the limited use of water helps to minimize nutrient loss, as some vitamins and minerals are sensitive to heat and water-soluble. To preserve the nutritional value while using a microwave oven, consider the following tips: Use microwave-safe containers: Ensure the containers used are microwave-safe to prevent harmful chemicals from leaching into the food.Minimize water usage: Steaming or microwaving foods with minimal or no added water helps retain their nutritional content.Cook in small portions: Cooking smaller portions allows for more even heating and reduces the risk of overcooking.Avoid overcooking: Use the appropriate cooking time and power level to avoid overcooking and nutrient loss. Check the food regularly to prevent overheating.Preserve texture and color: Microwaving foods for a shorter duration can help retain their texture, color, and overall quality.Prioritize balanced meals: Focus on incorporating a variety of fresh, whole foods into your meals to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet. It's important to note that microwaving food in microwave-safe containers, following proper cooking techniques, and maintaining a varied diet are all crucial for overall health and nutrition.

People donate recyclables in bulk all the time, and it’s probably the easiest, most eco-friendly way to separate yourself from them discreetly. Don’t offer up an explanation if nobody asks. To offer any sort of excuse implying you didn’t drink them all yourself is just inviting that very assumption. (Same goes when you buy it. Non-problem drinkers will plunk it on the counter; problem drinkers will volunteer that they’re “hosting a dinner party” or “having friends over” to the clerk ringing up their wine purchase.) If you only have a few, throw them in with your stuff (not together or they’ll clank). One in the gym bag, the other in your purse, and toss them into a public recycle bin. If you have no other choice and need to dump them in the trash, put the wine bottle into a sturdy paper bag and crush it with a hammer or rolling pin or rock. Then roll it up tight and stuff it in there, making sure the glass shards can’t easily escape. If it’s in the form of crushed glass, it’s not easily identifiable as a wine bottle.

That's why Ait station is junction. The Ait-Konch Shuttle is a train that runs with just 3 coaches and covers a distance of 13.68 kilometres in 35 minutes, at a sluggish pace of 30 Kilometers per hour. Sounds interesting? What is more interesting is the history behind this. Konch and Ait are two tiny towns in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh and comes under the Jalaun district.The crumbling 15 km road ride from Konch to Ait is a daunting one for bones, young and old. Tempos charge Rs 20 for each passenger and arrive at the destination in one hour.*The train made its first run around 1901-1903, even before the Railway Board was constituted in 1905.*Introduced by British, the shuttle was meant to ferry goods and passengers as Konch was a big market for cotton, forest produce, and ghee. The cotton was sent to Manchester for weaving.When the government decided to discontinue its services in 1997, thousands squatted on the railway line in protest. The railways tried to reason with them and a Rail Bus was sent to Konch to replace the shuttle. But the shuttle remained the locals’ first and only choice.Three months later, the train was back on track.There is no halt on the way but a passenger can flag it down with a wave, or request the guard to let him alight when his village nears. Students and traders from adjoining villages take it to travel to Konch, which is the tehsil headquarters and also has several educational institutions.

I’m not sure that Quora actually constitutes social media, per se, but it’s somewhat ‘moreish’ to me? Odd really, because Quora seems to bridge a strange gap in people’s lives! Unlike certain other social media sites, there is no inferred ‘snooping policy’ by the individual - I simply don’t care what someone has had for tea or, indeed, what they’ve been up to for the past 20 years - if someone hasn’t heard from me for 20 years, there’s a reason - for them and for me? However, the odd thing is that I seem to have made some friends because of Quora? Admittedly, these are ‘cyber-friends’, but I simply don’t care? Such people make me think, make me laugh and make me weep - but it’s good to ‘belong’! I consider myself to be considerably more ‘well rounded’ because of these wonderful people! Quora isn’t the sort of site for one to check on old friends, it’s the sort of site to make new friends! Long may it continue! Btw, it’s not for me to tell you how to run a successful business, but if maybe if you were to sell ‘Quora’ merchandise, you know the type of thing - mugs, tees, keyrings, baseball caps etc, then I think that Quora would do well out of it? Maybe, just maybe, if you were to award such items to (ahem!) ‘Top Writers’, then this would be good too?

I've never participated in a military drill, let alone an operation, so I don't have any tales worthy of a Hollywood film. Ah, well… I guess I'll just have to settle for that one incident where I was half an inch away from potentially dying. Oh, I have your attention now? Excellent. Let us begin. The story takes place in the summer of 2013, during the Officer's Training course, whose purpose is to take hungry, sleep-deprived soldiers and transform them into hungry, sleep-deprived soldiers with extra responsibilities. (Okay, it's not that bad. It's just common practice here in Israel for everyone to poke fun at the officers, including the officers themselves. Why serve more? The answer is obvious, yet we all ask it nonetheless.) Being religious, I was placed in the segregated unit from day one (“Goddammit.”), with a bunch of commanders who thought that since we were a bunch of dudes, we should go out and do macho things. That we should get our own ‘combat’ experience. So it was no surprise when they decided one day that instead of allowing us to take a (well-deserved!) break for a bit, a few lucky folks would be going out on a ‘patrol’ around the base, because, you know, it builds character. We were to split up into two teams of four, each equipped with a team leader and a dude with a walkie-talkie the size of a tank (that's me!), and thus learn to operate seamlessly as a group. (In retrospect, it wasn't that stupid of an idea, but I still found it quite amusing to think about every time I thought about it when I sat in my office, working what was unmistakably a desk job.) (I also have absolutely no recollection who the three dudes on my team were.) The first task we were given was to patrol, which made sense, considering that this was point of the exercise in the first place. This involved pretending to walk in formation, a bit of crouching, and occasionally tackling the scenarios which our commander - who was walking behind us - improvised. “You see two shadows approaching from the right. Quick - what do you do?” We immediately get into position and crouch down, while our fearless leader shouts out in the shadow’s general direction: “Stop, stop*, and identify yourself!” There was no answer, of course. Non-existent shadows can’t talk. Next up was surveillance. We were told to head to the top of a hill, spread out, lie down on our stomachs, and be prepared for the unspeakable horrors which would undoubtedly befall us. My eyebrows were raised as I lay down on the rocks, but I kept still and quiet, awaiting further orders. It was then that I felt a sharp, intense pain in my thigh. For a moment, my mind didn't register what was going on. Huh? The hell? But it didn't take me any more than a single second to catch on. Oh, crap. I quickly stood up, slightly unnerved but still feeling relatively calm, and called out: “Commander… a scorpion just got me.” My commander walked towards me, unsure if I was being serious; my friends shuffled over hesitantly, wondering if this was actually part of the drill. “A scorpion? You sure?” “Damn sure.” He took out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and pointed it towards the ground. Sure enough, a bright yellow scorpion was scurrying around, circling a large rock which provided it shelter just a moment ago, a rock which I was unfortunate enough to lie directly upon. (Not the actual little bugger, but a close representation) The protocol in such a situation is simple: take a picture of the scorpion, kill it, and carry the guy who was stung away on a stretcher, pronto, and that's just what my unit did, minus the pronto part. Meanwhile, I'm feeling oddly calm about the whole situation. There's a certain serenity in knowing that the worst has already happened, and that things are no longer in your hands. (Or maybe that's just me being weird. Who cares? As long as it works.) My friends hoist me on the stretcher and we began our ten-minute trek back to base. Ever been on a stretcher before? It’s like a roller-coaster ride, with that exhilarating sensation of having your stomach drop out from under you every time you encounter a bump, except that roller-coasters are safe. Usually. Meanwhile, my commander is doing his due diligence by inquiring whether I’m feeling fine. I assure him that except for the fact that the stung area is burning like mad, I’m feeling perfectly fine and clear-headed, and that I’ll definitely let him know if I’m feeling woozy. So I’m sitting there in the stretcher, inwardly cursing every time the damn thing lurches because of my friends’ inexperience, but at the same time, I’m counting my blessings. It was fairly obvious to me what had just transpired: the sting managed to pierce the skin, hence the burning sensation, but it didn’t go in far enough for the venom to enter the bloodstream. If it was just a half-inch deeper, though… Ten minutes later, and my friends arrive at the entrance to the base, where a van is waiting to take me to the infirmary. I sit in the back seat and make myself comfortable, with my commander sitting beside me, obviously thinking about how he could get us out ‘patrolling’ again without us being attacked by potentially deadly animals. Meanwhile, the officer sitting alongside the driver decides that now would be an excellent time to discuss different types of scorpions and how venomous they are. “So, you know, it's common knowledge that yellow scorpions are far, far deadlier than the black ones. The black ones are pretty tame, you know? But those yellow ones… don't mess with the yellow ones. Nasty little buggers.” And I'm sitting there in the back of the car, with a wry, exasperated smile plastered to my face, thinking to myself: Yup, just my lucky day, eh? “The size of the scorpion, that matters too. You see, no one wants to mess with larger ones because they're so big, right? But the small ones, they need a way to survive, so they have a more potent venom to compensate…” Strike two. Bloody hell. “… and then there's the pincers, of course. Same story. If the pincers are big, no problemo. But if they're small, you can be damn sure that it's the venom packing the punch.” Three for three! Lovely. Just... lovely. We arrived at the infirmary, and there just so happened to be a doctor on the scene who was able to confirm that I’d survive the ordeal. A bit of local inflammation, yes, but there was no venom working it’s way through my body, and that with a good night’s sleep at the infirmary I should be just fine. (My friends still tell me that I should’ve pretended that I was sick and played hooky for a few days. In retrospect, I’m not sure I disagree.) So, all’s well that ends well, I guess. I felt extremely glad that no harm was done (well, except for the poor scorpion, but I wasn’t feeling so bad for him at the time), and that I was extraordinarily lucky to have escaped what could’ve been a lethal experience by a margin of half an inch… … especially when it came to my attention a few weeks later that it was highly likely that the infirmary didn’t actually have the proper antidote at the time. Gotta love the military sometimes. * The second ‘stop’ is repeated for clarity, not because we can’t formulate a proper sentence."},{"instruction":"w much longer can the Russian economy sustain its war with Ukraine?","output":"As long as they have credit after they are out of their own money!"},{"instruction":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","output":"look up “nando paraddo”"},{"instruction":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","output":"1 no other number but 1 works in this equation.

And the media helped pave the way for the assault on the presidency to continue by making sure you hated him. That way, when the American sense of fair play kicked in, you would be easily able to ignore or override that impulse to take it easy on him after you’d finished bashing him like mad to begin with. No. President Trump doesn't deserve your compassion. He is teh debil. What a fine lot you Democrats are. You and the dung heap of what they pretend to be journalists in the industry.

Here is the short version: Lots of rain and mudUncontrollable pestsFrequent bombardmentsUnrelenting exhaustion The long version: Trenches were 10 feet deep or so, reinforced with sandbags and other materials. They were not straight, but were zigzagged. This was so that, in the case of an enemy intrusion, they wouldn't be mown down standing in a line. There would several trenches parallel to each other, with communication lines connecting them. There would be dugouts throughout, and various outstretches for sentry posts. The front lines were usually around 200 yards apart from each other, but sometimes as close as a few yards. The first horror to mention is the water and mud. Because many of the trenches (especially British) were dug in low-lying areas, the would hit water after just a few feet. Not only that, but the years of WWI were particularly rainy. Men would usually be up to their ankles in water and mud, not uncommon to be to their thighs, and on some occasions, as high as their necks. Trenches were constantly being re-dug and repaired from all the rain damage. Soldiers would be covered in mud from head to toe, in all orifices. Trench foot was a common ailment, sometimes resulting in amputations. Great coats would soak up the water, adding as much as 40 pounds to the overall wait. Movement in general was extremely exhausting and inhibiting. The second to mention are the pests. Rats infested the trenches in numbers of tens of millions. They were notoriously bold as well, having no second thoughts to crawl over a soldiers face while he slept. They invaded food supplies at every chance, spreading disease. Worst of all, the feasted upon the many corpses in the trenches and in No Man's Land. They were described as so big and menacing, that they would eat a wounded man if he was defenseless. Lice was another problem. Men were constantly infested with lice of all varieties. Although delousing methods were employed, they were of little use. Eggs were always dispersed among the soldier's clothes, hatching under human body heat. Much disease was spread at the feet of these vermin. Despite the horrific scenes described, there was still the whole war thing going on. Both sides were always struggling to gain an upper hand on the other. This was not a war of finesse, but of material. The result was usually massive bombardments on either side. The noise was described as particularly fearsome and hard to imagine. It was not just booms and whistles here and there, but a symphony of explosions and destruction. It was said to be so deep and powerful, that it was felt in the ears, not heard. It was almost tangible, a wall of sound you could touch. Not to mention was the close and helpless proximity to the assault. One soldier described it as being tied to a stake while someone swings a sledgehammer around. In general, soldiers were just tired. There was rarely, if ever, a comfortable place to sleep. The amount of energy required just to move down the line pained and strained the body to levels few can identify with. The strain on the nerves was also very taxing, as was the constant smell of human excrement and decomposing corpses. Apparently, men's imaginations were worn down as well. The rustling of barbed wire or shadows in the darkness were constantly instilling paranoia in soldier's minds. Overall, life in the trenches in supposedly the closest the Hell that anyone on Earth has ever gotten. Thats what they say at least.

You see, as shown in Halo 2, Master Chief is able to fit into an ODST Drop Pod. Thus my group of Spartans could easily use this tactic to negate the effectiveness of the walls, and other static barriers. I would probably equip them with battle rifles, as they will be very effective against the English longbow men. As a side arm I would definitely give them their Magnums. Though-while storming the interiors of the castle/keep, or the watch towers, I would equip them with their Caseless SMG’s, Assault Rifles, and of course-their greatly augmented strength. For personal defense I would not worry too much. Depending on the generation of Spartan, a personal energy shield would be available. Not to mention their MJOLNIR power armor-I think they can afford to take a scratch of two from an arrow-or a side arm from the archers. I would say this operation would have little to no causalities on my side-except for maybe myself-and anyone who may be caught up in an accident with their drop pod-and did not have time to lock their armor-especially if there is viscosity in the Gel Layer of their armor. RIP. Though these English archers would probably surrender at these Towering men and women-who rain down from the heavens-showing themselves. Especially if some unlucky defenders were crushed by the Drop Pods. Though-if you meant Spartan Rangers from the Metro series-then this answer will have to be reworked considerably!

Comic books have been around in Japan since as early as the Edo period I believe, so it was a natural step for them to embrace technology in a way to make it a different medium to consume the already familiar format of comic books. (Ghibli was kind of an exception from this, and there's a reason he's considered the “Disney” of Japan) Most anime remain 12 frames a second and is produced quickly, because it's still at the end of the day a visual manga-- a vehicle for the story. (Although I'd argue a lot of anime has cared about visuals as well in the past, like Inu Yasha and some of the other classics.) However, with influence from Western animation, the whole spectrum seems to be changing a bit, and you see animes like Your Lie in April which are just plain gorgeous to watch.

Here are a few examples: 1. Lack of empirical evidence: Critics argue that there is no empirical evidence or scientific proof supporting the existence of an afterlife. Since the afterlife is often considered to be a realm beyond the physical world, it falls outside the scope of direct observation and measurement, making it difficult to provide empirical evidence for or against its existence. 2. Dependence on brain function: Skeptics suggest that consciousness and personal identity are intricately linked to brain function. According to this view, when the brain ceases to function at death, consciousness and personal experiences also come to an end, leaving no basis for an afterlife. 3. Inconsistencies among religious beliefs: Different cultures and religions have diverse and often contradictory beliefs about the afterlife. Critics argue that the wide range of beliefs and lack of consensus among religious traditions weaken the credibility of any specific afterlife claim. The existence of numerous conflicting accounts raises questions about the validity and objectivity of these beliefs. 4. Evolutionary and naturalistic explanations: From a naturalistic perspective, proponents argue that human beliefs in an afterlife may have evolved as psychological and sociocultural constructs. The concept of an afterlife could provide comfort, meaning, and moral guidance, contributing to the survival and cohesion of human societies. 5. Physicalist worldview: Some philosophical and scientific perspectives, such as philosophical materialism or physicalism, posit that everything, including consciousness and personal identity, can be explained by physical processes. From this viewpoint, there is no need to invoke supernatural or metaphysical explanations like an afterlife. It's important to note that these arguments do not definitively disprove the existence of an afterlife. They represent different perspectives that challenge the notion of an afterlife based on empirical evidence, philosophical reasoning, and alternative explanations. The question of whether an afterlife exists or not remains a deeply personal and philosophical matter, often influenced by individual beliefs, cultural backgrounds, and religious or spiritual traditions."},{"instruction":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","output":"I'll ignore the famous legends (Arthur, Robin, etc) and tell you of a couple of legends from places within twenty miles of my home. First, the Boggart of Boggart Hole Clough. Boggarts aren't an invention of J. K. R, but a legendary creature. Traditionally they lived in peat marshes (locally called \\"Mosses\\") eating those who wander off the few paths through their habitat, they are particularly fond of children (well they do tend to be more tender). They did this for over a thousand years, until humans got their act together, digging out the peat for fuel and soil improvement, digging drains to lower the water table, making the paths and later roads through the mosses safer. Boggarts weren't the most social of beings and didn't co-operate the way humans could when faced with a threat, so slowly they were driven out of their homes, left to wander homeless until they finally died. That is, except for a few individuals. One Boggart saw the writing on the wall, or rather the dropping water levels, and went looking for a new abode. One version of the story has it that the Boggart crossed paths with a priest who rather than cursing the creature on sight, gave it a choice, to either depart this Earth, or to become a helper to a farmer who lived on a rather poor piece of land known as a \\"clough\\" (pron' kluff). The Boggart took the offer and as long as the farmer respected it, the Boggart was a superb farmhand, protecting the farmer's flocks, churning the butter etc. If the farmer failed to respect or thank the Boggart, then the Boggart was allowed to play tricks on the farmer. Sometimes the farmer would deliberately not thank the Boggart, just to see what his helper would do this time. Unfortunately, the farmer died and the farm was taken over by a Mr Bell who didn't know of the arrangement. Here's a poem from about that time, concerning what happened next: Come listen to this merry tale of honest Farmer Bell Who lived in an old farmhouse top of Moston Dell. He was a farmer bold, I heard, who ever gripped a flail, He had cows and horses, pigs and sheep, cheese and nut brown ale. For years and years, time out of mind, a little mischievous elf Made the ancient farmhouse his and there had lodged himself. He ate the butter, drank the milk and sucked the new laid eggs, Put the milk pails up the chimney and cracked the table legs. The farmer’s shoes he filled with sand, often hath been said, Put spiders in the buttermilk and cinders in the bread. Now Farmer Bell he knew fine well, though goodness knew why, The Boggart bore a grudge and drove him mad well nigh. The doors they slammed, the timbers creaked, the very house did shake And pots and pans flew round his head and on the floor did break. Was more than flesh and blood could stand and so thought Farmer Bell, I’ll run away, I will, and somewhere else will dwell. I've stood it long enough I have, it matters not a whit, Needs must when Boggarts hold the reins, I'll pack my things and flit. I am a farmer bold and I will cheat this cunning elf, I'll keep the secret of my plan and leave him to himself. One morning farmer Bell put all his things up on the cart, He locked the door and took the reins, and whispered, “Let us start. We'll leave this Boggart here alone”. Without more ado, \\"Thar't wrong\\", a voice came from the churn, \\"I'm flitten with you too!\\" \\"Thou art not\\" the farmer cried, and turning to his men, Said \\"Get those things down off the cart and in the house again.” “Its just to get away from you”, poor Farmer Bell did sigh, “What can’t be cured must be endured so here I’ll live and die!” Poor Farmer Bell he passed away when he’d lived long enough And now the place where he did dwell is called Boggart Hole Clough. When Farmer Bell died, the farm was abandoned as uneconomic. There is now a 190 acre public park on the site, It's heavily wooded and rather eerie, but as long as you show the Boggart some respect you are perfectly safe… probably. Another local legend is that of the \\"screaming skull of Wardley Hall\\". Wardley Hall is one of the few buildings mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and is now a grade 1 listed building which currently serves as the residence of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford. There is no doubt that there is a skull there, and no doubt about its original owner, the Catholic priest, Father Ambrose Barlow who was hanged, drawn and quartered in 1641 for his faith. His head was impaled on a spike, but the owners of Wardley Hall, who were themselves Catholic, stole the head and hid it in the hall. It wasn't rediscovered until the mid 1700s when part of the hall was remodelled. A servant mistook the skull for that of an animal and threw it into the moat. That night, and for days afterwards, the area was hit by powerful storms which threatened to seriously damage the hall. The owner at that time, Matthew Moreton, had part of the moat drained and the skull recovered and placed back inside the hall. The storms abated within a day. Stories of attempts to burn or remove the skull resulting in massive storms continued for nearly a century, just insulting the skull would cause it to scream, but with the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829, and the hall becoming the residence of a Catholic Bishop, the skull seems to have mellowed. It was even stolen in 1930, but was returned shortly afterwards with the thief merely complaining of \\"bad luck\\" rather than of being struck by lightning."},{"instruction":"keep working out, but I'm not seeing any progress.

Same woman, same acts, different perspectives from people with different experiences and priorities. Margaret Thatcher is arguably the single most polarising figure in post-war British history. A lot of people think she was Satan incarnate; a lot of people think she saved the country. A lot of both groups refuse to countenance any more nuanced interpretation than theirs; the ‘correct' response to her name has become a shibboleth - a tribal identification marker.

Over time, my consumption increased to the point that I was smoking about 30 cigarettes per day, a pack & a half. I wanted to quit for a couple of reasons: The price of my premium brand raised to 7/pack at the convenience stores, and I was experiencing disturbing symptoms…gurgling in my lungs when I lay down in bed, and shortness of breath. In my pre-smoking youth, I was on my HS track team as a miler, and one of my favorite pass times was daylong bicycle rides. My record, on a one-speed Sears tank, was 125 miles between sunrise and a bit after dark. I was convinced I would smoke until some related illness took me out, I could not conceive of quitting as even being a possibility. But, a co-worker received a cigalike as a Christmas present in 2009, which intrigued me. Within a few weeks, I’d ordered and received my first cigalike, it was January 10, 2010. The things were HORRIBLE! But, I knew it was going to change my life. I was right. Over the decade of the 2010s, the technology rapidly improved. But, in the beginning, I spent thousands of dollars buying all kinds of crap that didn’t work for me. Eventually, the tech caught up and there were workable devices available. I haven’t bought any hardware in years, once I found a system that worked for me I stocked up for the rest of my life (I’m 69 today). No interest in chasing the latest boutique devices, I’m settled. For the past 4+ years, I’ve been using primarily unflavored eLiquid: Propylene glycol and nicotine. Flavorings add safety question marks and cost a LOT more money. Once I quit smoking, my lung capacity improved rapidly! I’ve had two doctors tell me that it’s almost like I’d never smoked. If you stop tormenting your lungs, they heal rapidly. You also learn that your senses of taste and smell quickly return. Within only a few weeks of switching, I found I no longer had any interest in smoking. The fact is, I hadn’t planned to quit. It was almost accidental, I had a half dozen cartons of cigarettes on hand. I’d been buying from Ukraine, to save money. I sold one carton dirt cheap to a co-worker, and then literally threw 4–5 cartons in the garbage! No interest in smoking. I bought the first one as a curiosity only. I’m kinda a gadget freak. Vaping has at the very least extended my life. If I’d continued consuming a carton per week, I doubt I’d be alive today. I’ve never used a Juul or any of the other convenience store crap. Yes, I still consume nicotine, but that is an optional component of eLiquid. I mix my own (lots cheaper). I’m mystified that the primary health organizations refuse to endorse the most effective smoking cessation aid ever devised, but rather demonize it. I absolutely do not condone non-nicotine addicts, non-smokers, to take up vaping. I don’t believe any cigarette addict thought they’d become addicted. But millions do. No reasonable person claims it’s without risk. But it’s a greatly reduced risk over habitually inhaling SMOKE. Nicotine isn’t the big killer, it’s the smoke, and vaping produces no smoke."},{"instruction":"What do you think about Joe Biden’s plan to create new manufacturing jobs and boost American production?

When one relies on these structures for learning, one’s capacity for contextual learning, i. e. the ability for analyzing situations and for seeing the bigger picture, becomes restricted and limited in scope.

Similarly, the English Mastiff is also a very large breed that can weigh up to 220 pounds (100 kg) or more. However, one of the reasons that there are no dogs that reach the same size as the largest big cats is that dogs have been selectively bred by humans for thousands of years to serve various purposes, such as hunting, guarding, and herding.

My PC rig started with a POS computer from Best Buy that my parents got years ago. Paired with a single “HD” monitor and a blue tooth keyboard and mouse combo. The mouse would at times freeze and stop working. I would have to wait and give it a second to catch up. You can see how this is bad you go to turn around to shoot someone and your mouse is frozen. The keyboard would do what is called “ghosting” it happens when multiple keys are pressed at the same time but the keys aren’t registered. I think you can see how this can be annoying especially in games where there is a focus on driving such as World of Tanks. Where you need to drive up quickly to a corner and stop. If your keyboard ghosts and doesn’t register you pressing the stop key, you will end up driving in to the middle of an intersection and get shot in the side and killed. A big selling point of gaming keyboards and mice is that they have anti-ghosting systems and features. They also have a reduced latency. Latency is the measurement of the time it takes the keyboard to register a input from the user and tell the computer about the input.

He wrote a big note pristine heartedly. He wrote how and when all this started and how he sees this for future. When her friend showed her the letter. She was impressed but she was never interested in all these things. So it was an indirect no. Boy didn't leave hope . In the 2nd year of his PG he again approached her indirectly. This time girl said that don't come to me, instead approach my family. That would be much better. Boy already shared his feelings with his family and they were ready. Meeting Fixed between 2 families: (They were given 15 minutes to talk and decide). Girl: I want to ask you 2 questions. And my yes depends upon them. Boy: Yes please. Girl: I don't want to marry for 3 more years because I want to support my family financially. Boy: Done. Next please. Girl: Even after marriage I won't stop helping my family financially till my younger brother gets into his field. Boy: No. Girl: Then I am sorry we can't make it.

The famous paper of Einstein, Padolsky and Rosen considered entanglement as the mechanism that could achieve just that, by measuring the two properties using each of two entangled particles. This was meant to highlight an inconsistency with quantum mechanics, but instead actually revealed how quantum mechanics is different from classical reality. When you're just looking at one particle, there is no way around the HUP. The simple act of measurement actually changes the quantum state of the particle to reflect the measurement. Unfortunately that change is simply incompatible with the other measurement. For example, if you make a precise position measurement, the momentum of the particle becomes undefined. Similarly, a precise momentum measurement will correspond to an undefined position. You can actually see this easily enough in practice in real life in common optics. The HUP is completely analogous to diffraction and imaging in optics. That's because the properties of the HUP are described by the mathematics of the Fourier transform, which is a ubiquitous mathematical technique used throughout optics and radio engineering. You may have heard of or actually built a pin hole camera. That works on exactly the same principle as the HUP. It's called a diffractive lens. The pinhole effectively performs a position measurement on the incoming light. The image that is formed on the film is simply those positions arranged on the screen. It's usually simpler to just do a bit of ray tracing to see how the pinhole camera works, but it's just equivalent to the Fourier transform/HUP treatment. Edit: The pinhole actually performs an effective momentum measurement of the incoming light field. Those momenta are transformed into positions at the screen. The image is only formed once you are far enough from the pinhole. This is called the far field. The near field (pin hole) and far field (image) are related by the Fourier transform. The pin hole serves as a momentum filter simply by requiring the light from any distant object travel in a well-defined direction to pass through the hole. This direction, or wavevector, is equivalent to momentum. This is why ray tracing works to explain the pinhole camera. Therefore a momentum measurement at the pinhole is transformed into a position measurement (image) at the screen. The HUP is thus equivalent to stating that the pinhole and the image can't be at the same place. Because I'm short sighted, I would often make a small aperture with my fingers to correct my vision. It works remarkably well. With optics you can see why you can't make two measurements of the same particle. It is related to there being different optical planes. One plane is the imaging plane, which is akin to the position measurement. The other plane is called the Fourier transform plane, and it corresponds to well-defined momentum measurements.

So why does van Gaal do this? THE DECISIONPlanned in advance:This was not a decision that Louis van Gaal took in the last minute. It was something that was well planned out from before. Tim Krul was prepped by the goal keeping coach and was told that if the situation arose, he would have to take the place between the posts during the shootout. van Gaal hid this plan from Cillessen so that it would not damage his confidence or affect his game. CILLESSEN Cillessen was clearly unhappy about being substituted. He probably felt he wasn't believed in or was not a big fan of the fact that he wasn't informed in advance. However, he was seen passionately celebrating each Dutch penalty and also the saves that Krul made. He hopefully understood the genius behind the change. van Gaal made it a point to dispel any rumors of a change in the number one keeper for the rest of the tournament, claiming Cillessen remains his number one choice. THE ADVANTAGESRendered any prior Costa Rican preparation uselessIf the Costa Ricans had prepared for penalties, they would have studied Cillessen and his motions. However, in walked this other guy whom they did not research at all. He's very confident and is mouthing taunts at them. They have no idea who he is nor have they studied his motions. Also, it may have helped that Costa Rica had its previous game go to penalties. He probably observed how they approached that shootout. Surprise, bit**!When you are so surprised at such a critical stage of an important match, you feel outwitted. It's like preparing all night for one proof of a theorem or a topic for an examination because you are a 100% sure that it will be asked and then you find a 100 mark question on something you didn't study for at all. Even though you may still get it, your confidence is not high at all. DeceptionKrul is not a specialist at saving penalties. A record of 2 saves out of 20 is not the sign of a penalty specialist. But did the Costa Ricans know that? He sure looks like a penalty expert for all they know. Why would van Gaal bring him on otherwise? Clearly, a psychological decision and not a tactical one. Pressure and attention off his playersThis was THE MOST IMPORTANT reason as far as I'm concerned. As soon as van Gaal made the change, all the attention deflected from the kick takers to the decision he made. If Netherlands, who have a horrible record at penalty shootouts, had indeed lost, he would have been blamed for a ludicrous decision. No one expected anything from Tim Krul either. Thus, it was a sacrificial move, showing that he was ready to take the heat in case something went wrong. Penalty shootouts are won and lost very easily. It's about handling your nerves well. When the pressure was off the Dutch kick takers, their experience came to the fore. He sent his four most experienced kick takers (with Huntelaar probably in line to take the fifth) to ensure nervousness would play no role in the result of a spot kick. And then, something amazing happened. Four perfect penalties. Even the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, who had such an amazing tournament and game and should have been coming into the shootout with great confidence, would have been slightly shaken by the sudden presence of the chatty Krul. The Dutch keeper dives the right way each time (5 out 5, saving two of them) after taunting the opposing kick takers into making mistakes. (His first save wasn't really extraordinary or anything.) This is probably the result of his studies of the kick takers from the previous shootout that Costa Rica took part in. The players may have had conflicts about whether they should stick to what worked for them last time or if they should do something fancy to beat this \\"penalty expert,\\" whose job was just to apparently find out which way they were going to go.

The Higgs mechanism is the mechanism by which some particles are endowed with rest mass in the Standard Model of particle physics. The essence of the Higgs mechanism is spontaneous symmetry breaking. The idea is that the Higgs field is unlike any other field: its lowest energy state does not coincide with the state when the field is free of excitations. This means that the original, high energy vacuum of the early universe can decay and achieve a lower energy state, the “true” vacuum, by creating excitations in the Higgs field. This has two specific consequences. First, the process breaks the internal symmetry of the mediating particles of the electroweak (unified electromagnetic+weak) interaction, and three out of four of these particles become very massive as a result. (The one that remains massless is the photon.) Second, charged fermions, which used to interact with the Higgs field before symmetry breaking, now interact with the field’s so-called vacuum expectation value, which is nonzero. That is to say, for all practical intents and purposes, particles like electrons and quarks now interact with the vacuum itself, which is equivalent to having mass. So these particles become massive, too. And in this “true” vacuum, the Higgs field behaves differently. It still has short-lived excitations, which we see as short-lived particles: Higgs-bosons. These particles are very massive and decay almost immediately. This convoluted picture allows us to “have our cake and eat it, too”. A theory that starts with massive fermions or massive vector bosons is mathematically ill-behaved. A theory in which these particles are massless can be made well-behaved (“renormalizable”) but we know from observation that particles like electrons do have mass. The Standard Model begins with a theory of massless particles, hence it is renormalizable; yet symmetry breaking then gives us the observed spectrum of massive particles. But beyond these theoretical achievements, this is not something that we can “make use” of. Or rather, we’re making use of it all the time, simply by existing: Electroweak symmetry breaking results in the world around us, with all its low-energy physics and chemistry that makes our existence possible. We can (briefly) replicate conditions before symmetry breaking in high-energy particle experiments, which allow us to study the properties of these particles and the mechanism of symmetry breaking, and understand Nature a little better. Perhaps one day, these experiments may even have direct practical applications. But for now, we are simply building knowledge, not unlike physicists a century ago who were building knowledge that back then had very little use, but nowadays forms the basis of many things, including the semiconductor industry or high-tech medicine.

These two front-end, open-source frameworks for building SPAs and dynamic web applications share a number of characteristics. The key differences between AngularJS and Angular are listed below. Architecture MVC, or Model View Controller Design, is how AngularJS operates. Here, View displays the data from the model while the controller does data processing. Components and directives are used by Angular. Component in this case is a directive with a template. Efficiency and Speed and power The manufacturing process is eventually made less time- and labor-intensive thanks to Angular JS's two-way binding capability. Angular: The revised framework now has a better structure, which improves performance and speed. Management Due to the growing amount of the source code, managing the AngularJS project is challenging. In [LINKED_TEXT: Angular Development] [URL: https://www.binstellar.com/angular-development.html] the code for larger applications written in Angular is easier to write, manage, and better structured. Dependency Injection AngularJS- There is no use of DI. A hierarchical DI method is used in Angular. Routing Due to its component-based architecture, Angular includes an integrated Angular router when comparing AngularJS to Angular. As a result, the components operate independently without the need for a global router and maintain their own sub-routes. On the other side, AngularJS offers native routing that is established via controllers from template to URL routes. Due to its method of imitating a directive for retrieving the client view by using URLs, Angular prevails in this AngularJS vs. Angular contest."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"Saalumarada Thimmakka Saalumarada Thimmakka is an Indian environmentalist from the state of Karnataka, noted for her work in planting and tending to 384 banyan trees along a four-kilometre stretch of highway between Hulikal and Kudur.

Books and movies don't do justice when describing a country as vast as India. You can only truly get to know and understand a country after you experience it yourself. Similarly, India is much more than beautiful landscapes and wildlife. It has evolved much over the past few decades by embracing modernity with traditions and cultural diversity. So, what may have been true some years ago, has changed. Here are some distinctive things that can surprise international students coming to [LINKED_TEXT: study in India.] [URL: https://www.studyinindia.gov.in/admission/Registrations] Land of multiple languages: Hindi is not the only language spoken in India. Almost every state has its own language. Only after visiting India do most foreigners realise there are several languages and dialects spoken in different parts of the country. They are also amazed by how linguistic diversity is rarely an issue as many Indians are fluent in English. India is the second-largest English speaking country in the world. Shoes are kept by the door: In many Indian households, people take off their shoes before entering the house. There is usually a shoe rack or a section near the door where guests are expected to leave their shoes. Keeping the footwear outside prevents dust, dirt & germs from entering the house. It applies to religious sites as well with the purpose to preserve the sanctity of that place. Celebrating festivals in India: India is a [LINKED_TEXT: land of diverse cultures and heritage] [URL: https://www.studyinindia.gov.in/know-india-]. As a result, there are many festivals and celebrations you can experience almost every month. If you plan to study in India, do not miss out on celebrating with your Indian friends! You can go all out and dress up in traditional clothes, it will not be considered cultural appropriation here. Indians love it when foreigners embrace Indian culture, and when you dress in traditional clothes, people welcome the gesture happily. Not all Indian food is spicy: Spicy curries are a hallmark of Indian cuisine. However, the country has much more to offer than just spicy food. While many of our dishes do tend to be hot, there are just as many delicious dishes and snacks without a lot of spices. International students are often pleasantly surprised by India's delicious food— like dhoklas and pakoras, as well as delicious meals like dosa, dal makhani, palak paneer etc. Indian sweets are no less! There is also a wide variety of unique sweets like Jalebi, Gajar ka Halwa, Gulab Jamun, etc. that you can try. India is not always hot and humid: Contrary to popular belief, India is not always hot. Due to a variety of topography and other physiographic factors, different parts of the country experience varying climates as per their locations. While summers in India can be extreme in the southern region, this does not hold for the rest of India. Most foreign travellers are amazed and relieved to find that several cities, such as Ooty, Manali, and Shimla, have cool climates even during the hottest of summers. The country also experiences snow, spring and rain besides summers. Vegetarian food in popular fast food chains: Most global fast-food chains in India have a separate vegetarian menu. This might come as a shock to many as most of these foods aren’t available overseas and are exclusive to India. Alongwith the popular fast food chains like McDonald’s, many restaurants across India serve only vegetarian or Jain food (Vegetarian food that excludes underground vegetables).

However when riding for longer periods (>1 hour) you might find that this could turn into discomfort as it may block off blood flow some of the larger muscle groups (glutes and lower back). Gravity also plays a different role and you might find that blood pumps more easily through your legs than when riding an upright bicycle. This has a downside in that you can no longer use your body weight to push down on your pedals. There are a number of benefits to recumbent exercise bikes without many downsides compared to an upright bicycle. Personally I prefer a recumbent exercise bike because it leaves your hands free, is more comfortable and allows you to do any one of a hundred things while riding a bicycle and getting a work out."},{"instruction":"milk with Bournvita healthy?","output":"Bournvita is Never healthy option for your or even not for any child… Add Pure Honey (Led and Sugar Free)in milk or home made powder of mix dry fruits is good for your loving child to grow in better way… Good Luck for your child's better future Thank and Regards Dhawal Parekh (M) : 9898599755"},{"instruction":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","output":"Oh we have realized that for some time now.

When you work for someone else, you do it in a framework of collaboration, by which you have to meet certain expectations, and they have to fulfill others. It’s a 2 parties sport, and you want to do your part, so they would theirs. THAT is why you get up on time, to make sure you’ve done your part, being both anxious as you are eager for them to do theirs. When working for yourself, you have to establish the milestones, the rules, the expectations, the consequences when you fail. If you can’t play this 1 player game, nobody cares, you have to suffer by your own fault. Also when working with customers, a company can set boundaries. It can also retain money from a bigger project and pay you in trances, so you won’t be tempred to spend them all at once. When working by yourself you have to set the boundaries and assert them yourself, otherwise clients can end up calling at all hours, disturbing your private life or looking for made-up reasons not to pay for your work.

Since the show is taped in advance, the judges (who are seated on a row of tables in front of the audience) aren’t constrained by time to make their decisions, since all that time isn’t necessarily the same length as the two-minute or so commercial breaks.

He was polite enough to give satisfactory answers to all of my questions. We visited the centre several times. I went alone at first, then with my family. I felt that the quality of material given was highly consistent and honest across all of the talks. That's when I realized that Livspace was an excellent match for my style and goal for my home's interior design. The staff were friendly and outstanding. They were accommodating in closing my deal on acquiring house interiors with a decent offer and suggested some significant adjustments to my designs to match my taste and budget. The designer helped in making my dream interiors a reality. The designer's comprehensive explanation of the project. I shared the floor blueprints with Livspace and was given a quote immediately. It appeared to be easy work at first, but several aspects were considered, such as the materials, quality, and waterproofing, among others. I didn't know much about these topics at the time. The designer and project manager, on the other hand, guided me through everything. They gave me a 3D model of our entire modular kitchen to help me comprehend it better. The project team did an excellent job. Everyone was courteous and diligent in their job, as far as I and the Livspace company reviews could tell. Every day, the on-site manager would check in to make sure the carpenters were following the plans. He was a fantastic worker. Even though I lived on-site and could monitor the project's development, both the designer and the project manager kept in touch with me. The Livspace team goes above and beyond the call of duty.

A well known alcoholic/drug abuser that lived a short distance from the local hospital would go party the night away at homes all over the county and if at the end of the night, she couldn’t get a ride home, she would fake a seizure. She knew that calling 911 would secure her a ride home. We would pick her up, transport her to the Medical Center, she would sign out AMA and make the short walk to her house. A couple of times she would be ready to go before we could even finished the call report. In all fairness, she did have a history of seizures, and when they were legit the circumstance were different. We would be paged to her house, she would be sober and exhibiting signs of having just had a seizure (postictal, loss of bladder etc.) However, she would abuse the system using her epilepsy as a legitimate excuse, just to get a very expensive taxi ride home that she had no intention of paying for anyways. She became an expert at faking unconsciousness, you could perfom a sternal rub and she wouldn’t flinch, ammonia inhalents would not phase her. Although suspecting when she was faking it, we had no other choice but to treat accordingly. One particular night, we were paged out to a pedestrian versus car accident. Enroute, first responders were giving us patient updates over the radio like patient is unresponsive. We arrived on scene, there was “K” lying in the ditch unconscious and “unresponsive”, although she had no signs of trauma and her vitals were perfect, probably better than mine. We packaged her, Cervical-collar, full spinal immobilization, the works. After getting her into the back of the ambulance I attempted to check her pupils again, she would squinch her eyes making it difficult to open them. I swear, she almost had a slight smile on her face while I was doing it. I decided to try something, After leaving the scene and while enroute to the hospital, I yelled to my partner and told him to divert to another hospital that was about 25 miles away. It was like a resurrection from the dead, she come up off the spine board ripping off the cervical collar, trying to undo the straps that were securing her to the board, all the while saying I dont’ want to go to another hospital, stop and let me out right here. Yep, you guessed it, she was faking again. I told her to calm down that we would take her to the local hospital. I then asked her if she had really been hit by a car, she admitted that she hadn’t but that it was cold and she needed a ride home. I thoroughly documented the call. It was the last straw for my EMS director, he had her prosecuted for Misuse of 911."},{"instruction":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","output":"This famous photo was taken in 1961 as the Berlin Wall was being built.

It is true that until the twentieth century most Palestinians didn’t identify as Palestinian. Most of the people they came into contact with were also Palestinian, so a more useful answer to the question “Where are you from?” was to name their village. But to the outside world they were Palestinians. The villages they identified with were villages in Palestine. As for their origins, they are descendants of the ancient Canaanites and have been a continuous presence in Palestine for all that time, so the idea that they are just a mix of people from elsewhere is completely false. Think for a moment of Italy. Before the mid 19th century the Italian nation state did not exist and very few people thought of themselves as Italian. But it is completely undeniable that the nation of Italy exists and that Italian ethnicity exists. If we are to accept the Zionist argument that Palestinian ethnicity is bogus, we must accept that Italian ethnicity is bogus too."},{"instruction":"What is the best one liner you have written?","output":"Well,I have written something for myself❤️ Don't know if it is best or not :) Thanks for Reading :)"},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"You can start making money online right now by downloading tiktok and use the code BQ79441061 to start making money"},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"There are several good cars available in India for under 10 lakhs, depending on your needs and preferences.

I should know. I was morbidly obese as a schoolboy and have continued to put on weight since then. At twenty nine I weigh about 430 pounds. It has altered how I stand. With rolls of fat under my arms, my arms cannot hang perpendicularly to my body but are pushed outwards. I have put on considerable weight on my thighs so my legs are splayed and, to limit the amount of rubbing of my thighs against each other, I have more of a waddling walk and my stance and gait places unnatural stress on my knees and ankles. With the greater amount of weight in front my spine is flexed against it with my shoulders back and my head forward, which is a typical posture for a morbidly obese person. Being so heavy has changed my posture and gait and restricts my movements. I cannot cross my legs, get up from the floor without help or pick up objects from the ground. The most continual limitation to ordinary living is my inability to stand for an extended period or to walk significant distances. If I am on my feet for any length of time my back, and knee and ankle joints ache and become inflamed. When you do not need a seat you imagine that public spaces have many seating areas. When you actually need to sit, you find how few they actually are. Walking has its hazards. I do not like walking on uneven ground. I cannot see where I am putting my feet and I often have numbness in my feet which affects my balance. If I fall I risk serious injury so I generally keep to paved, even paths and sidewalks. Climbing stairs is an effort and I quickly become short of breath and start to perspire. Actually I feel hot most of the time. I know my mobility would be improved if I used a mobility scooter but I have held off getting one as it would result in me walking even less and taking less physical exercise. But suppose the day will eventually come when I succumb. The other constant handicap is that, despite the number of severely obese people, modern life makes little, if any, accommodation for them. Seating is an issue in all forms of public transport, many private cars, many toilet stalls (I am too fat to use a urinal), cinemas, theaters and many restaurants. Moving around in many shops also causes difficulties. Also, everything takes longer: getting washed and dressed, toileting, getting in and out of a car and walking generally. At first my health was not particularly affected by my weight, apart from periodic skin rashes and, as I have mentioned, joint pain. But not for long. As is quite typical, low esteem, lack of self confidence and loneliness led to depression for which I have been given antidepressants. Then I developed sleep apnea which means I am now reliant on a CPAP machine to sleep properly. Since then I have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome and will always need medication to control my high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels. I am prediabetic and at risk of developing type 2 diabetes with the attendant need for medication to control it. When I started suffering from sleep apnea I bought a bariatric hospital style bed as it enabled me to sleep with my upper body in an elevated position, which helped. It is easier to get on it and has a strap hanging down to pull me up. Since then I have acquired all sorts of equipment and specially designed furniture to assist me in everyday living. I had my bathroom redesigned with a higher, stronger toilet seat and enlarged shower cubicle. I have various long handled gadgets to help me wash, toilet, dress and pick thing up from the floor. I also have a recliner and dinning chairs which are made to take my weight. With my physical limitations in walking and fitting into seats and other spaces, it dictates what social events I can attend. I have become very wary of assurances that I will find no difficulties in attending an event. Normal sized people simply do not understand what my limitations are. For example, an invitation to a picnic or beach party sounds straightforward enough. What you may not have counted on was the long walk carrying baskets of food and drink over very uneven surfaces and a complete absence of seating when you get there. Yes, I can carry a folding chair, if I can manage it. If not, I will face the embarrassment of being hauled to my feet by at least two strong people. So, you can appreciate, I attend far fewer social gatherings than most people and where I spend my holidays and what I do on them is severely impacted. Another limitation is what clothing I can buy. After 4XL sizes most ordinary shops, apart from national chains, have little on offer. I generally buy on the internet where reasonably priced ordinary casual clothing is available. I long ago gave up buying suits. When I did for a special occasion I would wear it once and by the time I needed it again I could not fit into it. I generally wear joggers as they have elasticated waists, polo shirts and hoodies. As I cannot get down to tie shoe laces, all my shoes are slip-ons. The problem with large sizes is they are generally made for taller people and I am below average height, so the arms and legs are nearly always too long. Casual clothes are fine for work but I know it irritates my parents when I wear them to a formal occasion but it can’t be helped. People have preconceived ideas of morbidly obese people. I sense it acutely when I enter a room. How on earth did he get into such a terrible shape? What a loser. Very fat people are regarded as lacking any sort of self control, and being lazy, gluttonous,unhygienic and unhealthy. This carries into employment prospects too. Morbidly obese people stay in the same job for longer and are likely to receive fewer promotions and lower remuneration. I know that is why I haven’t changed jobs because finding employment is hard when a prospective employer thinks I will always be off sick or cannot physically do the job. As it happens I work longer hours and take fewer days off sick than nearly all my work colleagues. By nature and through experience I am quite a solitary person. I was teased and bullied at school and learned to keep myself to myself. I think the unhappiness I experienced led me to binge eat, which is a completely self defeating thing to do. I was unhappy because I was fat so I eat too much which made me fatter. In doing so, I became quite addicted to fast foods and sugary drinks and this addiction continues. I feel hungry nearly all of the time and the only food and drink that seems to satisfy is either fatty or sugary. I crave it constantly. In fact eating is one of my great pleasures. While it has not been deliberate, I find most of my close friends are obese; not as obese as I am, but on the large side nonetheless. I think they are not so judgemental about obesity and see me for who I am, rather than the size I have become. They also know how difficult it is to lose weight and keep it off. The answer you may suggest is that I should really work at dieting. If I had received a dollar for every time I was advised to lose weight I would be a wealthy man. My mother nagged me constantly and grumbled that I so quickly grew out of my school clothes. No doctors appointment goes without this advice. Well meaning friends and colleagues volunteer this recommendation too; sometimes even strangers. I am in admiration of the morbidly obese people who have lost weight and kept it off, but they are a very small proportion. The sad fact is that once you are morbidly obese, particularly if you became so in childhood, you will remain so. Like nearly every morbidly obese person I have been on countless diets. Weight loss is disappointingly slow. At some stage I abandon the diet out of frustration and quickly put back the weight and some more. If there was an easy way to lose weight there would be far fewer obese people. As it is we represent an increasing percentage of the adult population. In summary, I am resigned to being morbidly obese. I have learned to live with it and to work with the limitations it imposes. I don’t want surgery or any other intervention. In fact accepting who I am without complaint has been a considerable help. It has overcome my depression and I am no longer on medication for it. Now I just want to live my life and play out the hand I have been dealt."},{"instruction":"What are the best freelancing sites?","output":"Some of the best freelancing sites include Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, Toptal, and Guru.

In my experience with Quora, I have observed that the Quora members that ask thousands of questions tend to ask very basic questions. They never acknowledge the contribution of the people responding to their question by thanking them or giving them an upvote. That goes to show that they are not really interested in the answers.…they are just interested in making more money by asking as many questions as possible.

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","output":"A modern Greek speaker can go back much further than an English speaker, but not as far back as I think you may be imagining. A lot, of course, depends on the education of the Greek speaker. For a Greek speaker who is literate but not particularly trained in the ancient languages, they could probably make out a lot of most medieval texts and perhaps even some of the Greco Roman texts during late classical times. Compare this to English where reading texts that are more than a few hundred years old is virtually impossible for the average English speaker. The term Ancient Greek refers to the languages that existed before Alexander the Great. That was a very long time before the Romans came along. A modern Greek speaker would struggle to make out anything in those ancient languages without a lot of training. Why are Greek speakers able to read text that are so much older than English speakers? Greek has had a strong literary and intellectual tradition for millennia. It was also a very standardized international language for trade from the time of Alexander all the way until the end of the Middle Ages. As such, Greek has been far more stable and less prone to the extreme borrowing from other languages than English. EDIT: Another factor that has kept Greek somewhat stable over the last couple of thousand years. Greek culture has been viewed as a seminal culture throughout the Mediterranean and Europe for an extremely long time. The Arabs, Romans, Slavs , Turks , Germans and many others borrowed heavily from the Greek language. By contrast, Greek has borrowed small amounts from other languages but in particular has borrowed from ancient Greek, effectively borrowing from itself. The point is that the outside influences that tend to heavily influence other languages have been less of a factor for Greek in the last couple of millennia."},{"instruction":"What percentage of guys in the gym use steroids?","output":"Anabolic steroid is a type of steroid that is used in medicine to repair body tissues and to increase appetite and the growth of muscles. Anabolic steroids are made in the laboratory from testosterone They have in common the removal of a C19 methyl group from the androgen structure; this accentuates the effect of increasing [LINKED_TEXT: muscle bulk] [URL: https://portallucena.com/] at the expense of virilization. All anabolic steroids resemble testosterone in their pharmacological actions, but they vary in the ratio of anabolic to androgenic properties. Some preparations are active when taken orally, others have to be injected to avoid extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. They promote weight gain and bone mineralization. To this end, they are occasionally used in patients in a hypercatabolic state e.g. chronic debilitating illness, malignancy. However, the effect of anabolic steroids on muscle growth and activity has lead to their abuse by body builders and athletes. Illicit use is associated with dangerous side effects ranging from cholestatic jaundice to death when taken for several weeks, with a carefully controlled diet and exercise regimen, supraphysiological doses of testosterone (around 5-10 times the recommended replacement dose for male hypogonadism) increase fat-free body mass, muscle size and strength in healthy adult males, when compared with placebo plus diet and exercise Body builders and other gym-users sometimes use even bigger doses to increase muscle mass and strength, heighten aggression, and facilitate harder, more vigorous training Moderate increases in liver transaminase levels are common in people taking anabolic steroids; occasionally cholestatic jaundice and severe hepatotoxicity occur. Risk of liver toxicity is greatest with chronic administration of large doses of orally active C-17a alkylated steroids such as methandienone, methyltestosterone or stanozolol. Androgenic effects of anabolic steroids that occur commonly in both men and women are oily skin and hair."},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"Sure, here are some mind-blowing facts that may sound unreal but are actually true: 1.

While the US has made significant strides in education, certain systemic issues continue to plague the system and impede optimal learning outcomes. Let's explore some of the most critical problems of the quality of education in USA 1. Overemphasis on Standardized Testing The [LINKED_TEXT: education system in USA] [URL: https://numeneduservices.com/education-system-in-usa] gives standardized exams like the SAT and ACT much too much weight. As they largely measure memorizing and test-taking abilities rather than critical thinking, creativity, and practical knowledge, these exams frequently fall short of capturing a student's full potential. As a result, students frequently find themselves cramming knowledge without understanding it. 2. Lack of Holistic Learning The US educational system frequently places a strong emphasis on essential courses like math and science while ignoring the humanities, arts, and social sciences. This contrasts with the Indian educational system, which encourages a well-rounded education with emphasis on numerous areas. This limited scope limits pupils' exposure to a range of subjects, impeding their overall intellectual growth and capacity to think critically from a variety of angles. 3. Lack of Teacher-Student Interaction A student's learning experience may suffer as a result of the huge class sizes and little teacher-student interaction in the US educational system. In contrast to Indian schools, where teachers frequently have a closer relationship with their students, American educators may find it challenging to give each student individualized attention and assistance. Because of this, pupils' ability to advance academically and develop personally may suffer from a lack of guidance and mentoring. 4. Limited Practical Application of Knowledge The US educational system today favors academic learning above practical application. While theoretical ideas are crucial, it's also necessary to provide students with chances to use what they've learned in practical settings. By integrating more hands-on projects, internships, and industry collaborations into the curriculum, students can develop critical skills that are necessary for their future careers. 5. Inequality and Disparities There are major inequalities and disparities throughout the US educational system, particularly along socioeconomic lines. Students from underprivileged homes frequently don't have as much access to resources, quality education, and extracurricular activities that might benefit their entire development. To develop a more equitable and inclusive educational system, closing this gap and guaranteeing equal chances for all students should be a top goal. In conclusion, even though the education system in USA has many positive aspects, such as its emphasis on innovation and research-oriented universities, it is crucial to recognize its weaknesses and make improvements. From the perspective of an Indian student, addressing the excessive emphasis on standardized testing, promoting holistic learning, encouraging better teacher-student interaction, enhancing the practical application of knowledge, and reducing disparities are essential steps towards creating a more effective and equitable education system in USA."},{"instruction":"What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?","output":"I would say the answer best depends on your stream of study. First year students have class times from anywhere between 10 - 30 hours per week (lectures, tutorials and labs included). I would address Non- engineers first, then the engineers. For Non-engineers, be prepared to memorize stuff. Professors in the social sciences would go through material faster than Usain Bolt and you’d be cramming right before the exam trying to cover the 20 pages the professor spent 2 minutes on during lecture. Play it smart, understand how you can study best, skip some classes, attend others and form a network of peers who can actually help. For Comp. Sci., Rotman Commerce and Mathematics and Medicine, choose your courses wisely. The course descriptions you are supposed to look at to guide you are very misleading at times. Math, specially can be hard. Unless you love math, do not go for 137 or 157. 133 is light, 135/6 is a bit harder but bearable if you still want a challenge. You can choose 4-6 courses per semester, do not overburden yourself. Summer courses may feel tempting but they aren’t so good. Professors cram through material strikingly fast. To quote a senior “by the time you’re done saying “Hi” to the kid next to you, your midterm is tomorrow”, keep that in mind before deciding if you want to leave a course for the summer. Bottom line: It’s bearable, you made it to u of t, you can make it through u of t. My general advice for first year Keep up with your readings, the last thing you want to do is read 300 pages one day before the examCommunism wins. Find a good group of friends, enter into group chats and leverage them to your benefit. Help others and get help from others, you can not survive alone (unless you’re very smart, in that case, help others, the majority depends on you).Doctor your schedule. Keep enough gaps between classes so you can study. Don’t rush to end your days early, because at home there are too many distractionsKnow your professors. Some professors are superstars and some aren’t that good. Know which professors are best. Sometimes changing classes for the professor even if it messes up your timetable is worth it.Residences are over-rated. The prevalent joke is, people living in residences, don’t actually live in residences, they live in the libraries. They only go back to sleep.Do firsthand research on courses. For Electives and Seminar courses the descriptions on the internet are misleading. Ask someone who has taken the course how it is.Come to Campus. Even if you have only 2 classes on a particular day, come to campus. You may just end up catching up on something you would not have caught up on at home.Resist temptation. We are told u of t is fun, and there are a lot of “fun” places in and around campus, at one point you have to stop the “fun”, know when to apply the breaks.Be Realistic. While pessimism is definitely not a good idea, optimism isn’t either. You have to know what you are weak in, in order to play on your strengths. Don’t expect too much from life at u of t, have a sense of how much material you actually know before a test and try to capitalize the most out of it.Set a minimum threshold. Learn at least enough of everything that on an exam you will be able to write some good sounding rubbish in the tests. If there is even a shred of merit to your answer, you may get something, which is, as we have been told since eternity, still better than nothing.Not academic advice, but advice anyways! In the TTC we (do not) trust. Keep buffer times during your commute if you have a commute. Engineers usually have a greater workload (unless you are going for a double major in Comp.Sci. and Math; believe me there are people who do that!) that any other discipline in the university. For future engineers, be ready to give up everything you used to do for leisure in high school, it’s that bad. Nah, just kidding. The two semesters are very different in terms of the content covered. There is a lot of Math in first semester. Calculus 1 is partially review from grade 12 but towards the end they push through integration very quickly, and it is included on the final exam, look out for that. CIV100 is a physics course, dreadful, look out for that, introduces you to moments and forces and asks you to start thinking in 3d spaces right away. Depending on your taste for Mathematics, either you would love linear algebra or hate it. Three things to keep in mind about it, it is abstract, introduces you to proofs, and is useless for engineers. Second semester is a bit better (p.s. you get used to it). there are 2 physics (the physics of electricity - light and the physics of motion (Dynamics) - much heavier). Calc 2 has much less content than Calc1, the professors cover material very slowly because there isnt much to cover. It gets bad after the first 8 weeks. my advice for engineers: All lectures are recorded, there is no excuse of falling behind on material, if you miss class (or skip it, NOT RECOMMENDED), watch the lectures and catch up.Get into as many group-chats as possible. Group chats are the first resource of help when you are new, no body knows you, and you need help.Assignments and 1st year labs are free marks. If you can’t do them the group chat’s/friends would do it for you, don’t leave them (lowkey - I didn’t tell this to y’all).Learn to play it smart. GPA’s work weird, if you get 90’s in 3 courses and a 70’s in the other 2, congratulations your GPA just went down the drain. My advice: set a goal for what GPA you want, if you know you’re safely in the range, start focusing on other courses.Don’t leave anything blank. If writing F = ma can give you one mark, write it down (cough cough, it actually happend to me). You will see the pricelessness when right before the exam you are calculating what you need for the mark you were aiming for. Study just enough to write down at least some good sounding rubbish in the answer space.Always keep in mind, we don’t live in the USSR, even though the TTC was North America’s best transit system in 2017 (no comments), expect delays. keep buffers if you have to reach skule for important lectures/exams/labs. U of T sends out emails for transit delays sometimes, but be prepared."},{"instruction":"The Mahabhar","output":"Truly,there is no great warrior than gatogach.he single handedly destroyed many warrior s on 14th night of kurukshetra.besides if karna would have not used sakti weapon to him he would have used to Arjuna and totally the war would have won by kouravas.there is proof for his strength .the mighty demon has defeated abimanyu in fight.really he is the best.😎"},{"instruction":"Why are western countries including the United States publicly stating what military equipment they are sending to Ukraine?

Avoid slouching or hunching forward, as this can strain your back and neck.Use a supportive chair: Choose a chair that provides adequate lumbar support to maintain the natural curve of your lower back. If your chair lacks proper support, consider using a lumbar roll or cushion.Position your feet flat on the floor: Keep your feet planted firmly on the ground. If your feet don't reach the floor, use a footrest or an adjustable chair to maintain a comfortable position.Maintain a relaxed posture: Avoid tensing your shoulders and neck. Relax your muscles and allow your arms to rest comfortably on the desk or armrests.Position the monitor at eye level: Adjust the height of your computer monitor or laptop screen so that the top of the screen is at or slightly below eye level.

Entrepreneurial Mindset: How to Think Like an Entrepreneur? Who is an Entrepreneur and who is not? An entrepreneur is a person who does business with new methods. There is a thought behind doing business, a vision. Through his business, he makes an impact on the lives of the people, providing solutions to their problems. He is not afraid of the idea of failure while doing something new but tries to succeed by taking risks even if some of his efforts or plans do not succeed. Even then, keeping in mind his big objective, he keeps trying to succeed afresh even after taking losses. Entrepreneurial Mindset You would not call a person an entrepreneur even if he does his own business and is successful in his business, for whom the purpose of working is limited to making a living or earning profit and his main motivation is to find solutions to the problems of his people. It doesn't happen. He is afraid of failures and gets disheartened by minor failures and gives up even his important and ambitious plans. What is the difference between an Entrepreneurial Mindset and an Entrepreneurship School of Education? By the education of entrepreneurship skills, we mean – teaching the learner or student about various aspects of business. Like keeping an account of profit and loss, making plans to increase business, marketing customer service etc. By the education of Entrepreneurial Mindset, we mean – to inculcate the thinking of doing something new or doing it in a new way within the students. To inculcate in oneself the curiosity to find new solutions to problems and challenges and to inculcate the confidence to work on that solution, to inculcate the courage to persevere in one's purpose despite setbacks and challenges, and to develop leadership qualities with the eagerness to learn new things, to develop. Through an entrepreneurial mindset, you can develop the qualities that will make you an entrepreneur in whatever you do. What is the difference between being an entrepreneur and having the mindset to be an entrepreneur? By now it is clear that the meaning of crying entrepreneur is- a person who does his business but taking risks with new thinking, new way. Whereas Entrepreneurship Mindset refers to the way a person thinks and lives, whether he does business or does a job. It is necessary that every entrepreneur will have an entrepreneurial mindset, but it is not necessary that every person with an entrepreneurial mindset will be an entrepreneur. On what basis can we tell whether someone has an Entrepreneurial mindset or not? You can identify whether you have an entrepreneurial mindset by the way you think and act. Regardless of whether you work or do business, if you practice thinking fresh and adopting new ways before doing that work, you are full of faith in your thinking and new ways or fail. You are not intimidated, find solutions to problems and challenges and you are driven to work on them, and doing that work in a way that affects other people's lives, alleviates their problems, or gives them something provides new. What is the difference between a normal educated person and a person with an Entrepreneurial mindset? Many times you see that many people do not understand beyond their circumstances due to lack of entrepreneurial mindset, are afraid to take risks and therefore settle for a job or business that is less than their ability and talent. A normal educated person may have a degree or diploma, may have a good job or may have a successful business, but it is also possible that he has not understood his talent properly or despite being able to find it, work according to it. Have not been able to achieve success. The same person united with an entrepreneurial mindset recognizes his talents and the strong sides of his personality. He is not afraid of failure to innovate. He can take decisions based on analysis. He is ready to change himself according to the situation, the reason for being troubled by problems, with deep thinking, taking cooperation, believes in creating a new opportunity for himself. A person with an Entrepreneurial mindset takes care of honesty and ethics along with success in his career.

Ranger Companies are much smaller than Airborne Infantry Companies. A Division is a self supporting unit and contains its own Artillery, Recon, MPs, Medical Units, Logistics and Supply and is much much larger than a Regiment. Currently Rangers are assault units and shock units designed for specialized combat missions like airfield, bridge, prisoner recoveries or key terrain assaults. A Division would be more big picture strategic in its assignments. Currently the 82nd Airborne is our only Airborne Division. The 101st is now Air Assault. Airborne school was mostly PT and conditioning so I was glad I attended prior to Ranger School. Ranger school was more patrol oriented and was far more varied in the skills taught. It was also very much a small unit leadership course. Ranger missions today are very different than they were in Vietnam or back in WW2 or Korea. Instead of assault, shock troops deployed in Companies, and Battalions the primary focus was recon in 4 to 6 man elements. A platoon sized mission was rare. I am not sure how Rangers are used in todays operational theaters."},{"instruction":"Why do narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths seem to know how to read people?","output":"Narcissists study you closely, at least initially. Their envy can seem a lot like love to the unwary, when you're in love with someone you want to know all about them, and this is the same when you want to destroy them too. Being predators, these three subtypes superficially study people, to figure out how they tick. Lacking empathy, they exploit this knowledge for all it's worth. The sad thing is that in your desire to people please, you end up doing half the work for them, telling on yourself in the hope that they will not feel threatened by you, advertising your weaknesses as a type of friendship offering. Although it may be unpleasant at first having someone who wants to destroy you, don't shy away, don't appease them either, rise to the challenge. You didn't start it, but you'll finish it. There's a righteousness in defence that doesn't occur when one is preying on someone else — you may feel grandiosity as though God is on your side. You are standing up to defend what is right, and this rage can be deeply intoxicating. Use it wisely, don't merely waste it in childish tantrums. Wars are won by the cunning, not the stupid.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"I have two daughters, 9 and 10. I have full custody of both children and I love my children dearly. They are my entire life. I love being a dad, ever since I was 12 years old I saw my older cousins have kids before they were 25 and I said I want that! My relationship ended primarily to my spouse being unfaithful. She is barely in the lives of our children and lives 3 hours away from us. I have tried for years to encourage the mother to take a stronger role in her childrens lives and have never been vindictive about access to the children. In short she simply does not want to be a mother. Anyone who knows us can see this. My oldest child is literally a clone of myself. Looks, personality, etc. My second child is a lot like her mother. I am a heavy set man, my oldest daughter has a bit of a heavy set. My ex was a petite woman and my second daughter is a petite girl. My ex and I have both have brown hair brown eyes. My oldest daughter has brown hair, brown eyes. My second daughter is blonde, blue eyes. Personality wise I feel my second daughter is very similar to myself although she has been living with me since she was 3 years old. I love my daughter so much and I have always had it in the back of mind she was not mine. I would feel so crushed if I found out I wasn’t her biological father. I do not know if it is instinct or something but its almost like a scent I have with my daughters where I know 100% my oldest daughter is mine but I do not have the same feeling with the my second daughter. This to me is strictly a feeling. Not love or caring but something else. I can’t really explain it. To compare it’s like an animal knowing that one of her babies isn’t in the litter. I know finding out will crush me and I know it will create more problems with the mother because now I will want to know who it is. I cannot get it out of my head and I have gone in and out wondering if I should get the test done. The test has been sitting in storage for years and I have never bothered to open it because I am simply afraid to find the truth. I am weighing the pros and cons of finding out and there are several more cons. I have to know….I don’t know why. I know I would not cast her out if the results were negative, I would absolutely continue to be her father as that is all she ever known and it would be detrimental to her wellbeing to find out the one parent who did not abandon her is not really her father. I couldn’t imagine would that would do to her life. Alas, I want to know one day. I am thinking more and more about doing it and I feel I am in a good place mentally to process the information and continue our lives. I do not know what to do. I know you will think if you love her, what’s the point of finding out? I have given their mother so many chances and held so many reservations for her only to find she does more harm then good in the 12% of a month she actually has them when they decide to even go to her home. I feel I need to realize that I should be focusing more on the children’s lives then a woman who does not want to be a mother. I feel that I have wasted time encouraging them to respect their mother when she does not respect them. There is little emotional connection to their mother. I encourage them to call her as she rarely calls to talk to them. When they are on the phone after about a minute or two of the hi how are you it is complete silence between the 3 of them. I’m sitting there smacking myself in the face, but this is a direct representation that the kids are not going to take an interest in someone who doesn’t take an interest in them. When I call them we talk, same with anyone else in their life who they have learned actually care about them. I feel in a weird way finding out help me lose the connection to their mother which I now feel is what is best for my kids. I should not worry about them having a normal mother because they never will. I tried to do the right thing and never bad talked her or went after her for money or withheld my children as they were pawns. I took a 1/3 of the child support because I did not want to make our separation about money and I absolutely despise people who use the advantage of primary care/full custody to gauge the other party. Your kids are not your ex, the foundation of child support is broken. I do not agree with it so I do not partake in its guidelines. If I needed someone elses money to raise my children then I would not of had them in the first place. Aside from that I am broken in my decision and would appreciate any input.

Both Kahaani and Talaash released in the same year and gave a very good respite to the Bollywood industry by providing films in a new genre and with very good substance and acting."},{"instruction":"Why is Prince Andrew 'vocal' with the Queen that Charles 'shouldn't be King'?","output":"That’s based on the Express article, isn’t it… All honesty, the Daily Express is about as accurate on the news as the Beano at the moment.

I am the trustee of a family trust and a beneficiary. I wish to buy out the other beneficiary for five percent above market value. How can I do that?","output":"As you say, you’ll need to consult your own lawyer. I’ll throw in a few thoughts because it allows me to share some points that I think are of general interest, but I am not your lawyer and I’m not giving specific legal advice to you. Trustees dealing with beneficiaries pose a host of issues and there are numerous ways to go wrong. Therefore, there are usually compliance issues and they tend to be costly, even if it all goes smoothly. So a trustee should think twice — maybe more like a dozen times — before engaging in a transaction with a beneficiary.If a trustee is going to deal with a beneficiary, that beneficiary darned well better be represented by fully independent counsel who appropriately reviews the transaction and signs off on it. IMPORTANT POINT: this attorney will charge for this service.Okay, let’s assume the beneficiary gets an independent counsel who enthusiastically signs off on the deal. Done, right? No. I would most likely tell my client that they’d be an idiot if they didn’t get the transaction reviewed and approved by the probate court in advance. IMPORTANT POINT 2: both the trustee’s and beneficiary’s attorneys will charge for this service. IMPORTANT POINT NUMBER 3: even with everyone signing off, there may be reasons why the court won’t approve. I recently had a case where exactly this situation happened. All beneficiaries and trustees, represented by independent counsel, agreed on a transfer of assets, but the Court refused to grant permission. The Court independently concluded the transaction was not in the best interest of the beneficiary and was contrary to the testamentary intent. IMPORTANT POINT 4: Yes, everybody had to pay for the attorneys and the filing fees, etc. even though the exercise proved unsuccessful. Once again, I’m just giving a set of thoughts about issues to consider. Consult your attorney in confidence to secure real legal advice.

If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","output":"Lots of good answers on the imaging of atoms, but I’d like to focus on the meaning of the word “observable”. We don’t have to “see” things in order to “observe” them in the scientific sense. An observation is a point of data acquired about some aspect of the Universe. If observations are repeated and not seriously disputed then they are considered “facts” (a “fact” being defined as “an objective and verifiable observation”, see [LINKED_TEXT: Observation] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation] and [LINKED_TEXT: Fact] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact#In_science]). So, if at school, you did the cloud chamber experiment, where you fill a chamber with smoke and watch the particles of smoke moving under Brownian motion, apparently being bumped about by something small and invisible every so often, then you can say that you have personally “observed” di-atomic molecules. (When I was in school cigarette smoke used to be used, making this the only occasion when smoking was allowed under school rules and that made this experiment eagerly anticipated by about 1/2 the class, not sure if the positive effect of getting some kids who otherwise would not be interested in science outweighed the risk of getting some kid who otherwise would not started on smoking!)

There seems to be a significantly larger portion of engineering students in India than in the US. Is the perception of engineering different? If so, why?","output":"To answer this question, let us rewind a bit and try to understand what led to this craze. In the early 1990s, India underwent globalization and liberalization which was accompanied by the infamous brain-drain. Prestigious companies from abroad realized the potential of the hard-working, highly competitive and intelligent engineers in India and offered them jobs abroad. Attracted by the fat pay check and lavish lifestyle, engineers flocked to other countries resulting in extensive brain drain. This led to the mindset that smarter kids would become engineers or doctors. The enrolment into these engineering or medical courses became a standard of validation of intelligence of the kids since the other courses like arts or literature were easy to get in. As opposed to the medical courses, engineering is a four-year course with instant remuneration upon graduation. The rewards were guaranteed within a short span of time. The internet era and IT boom in India paved way for more engineers and created greater opportunities for them. The MNCs (Multi National Corporations) from other countries began to outsource work to these Indian engineers for a higher salary as compared to an Average Joe working at a local firm. This led to the gradual rise of the middle class society who now craved for higher remuneration and greater comfort. Once accustomed to such luxury, the wants turned into needs. To ensure the sustenance of such a lifestyle, engineering degree seemed a promising way to go about. Also, an engineering degree gives the flexibility of changing career paths after graduation. Due to their logical mindset and application based approach in problem solving, engineers are found in almost every profession. To sum it up, here are some of the major reasons for the engineering craze in India: Financial securityPerception of intellectual superiorityIT boomFlexibility of changing career paths"},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"Don’t say anything at all.

We have to control ourselves at that time or shift to other channels to cover everything in a short time and skip unnecessary things. Electronic media is run throughout day and night and it can become addictive. So, we should watch them once or twice instead of the whole day.

As long as you are communicating and getting your message across to another person then I suggest you are both speaking and hearing the same language. The most important thing is to communicate. No one is really a native English speaker. Most just speak with confidence born of chatting away with family from berth. So my advice chat away and be prepared to listen a lot to ensure that the communication is complete. pat your self on the back and have another drink (cup of tea or beer).

If you’re talking Europe, or the rest of the world, then it’s complicated. The simple answer is, reactions to Darwin are divided between “the English countries” and “everywhere else”, based on how differently people deal with their own culture and outside imports. I think the following Wiki extract on the continental publication of Darwin’s work is one of the best commentaries on (Western) European culture I’ve ever seen: (On the Origin of Species) was widely translated in Darwin's (own) lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. (…) (Darwin) welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #JccQT]—in other words, you try to publish your book there, and everyone will try to “adapt” it to their own flavour of ethnic idiocy. And make no mistake, this is how evolution was received in those countries, even after the zany adapted translations were fixed. In England and America, evolution was “charged” because it pointedly contradicted the ideas of world order accepted by English (and none other) authorities since the disputes of the 16th century. The whole English version of Christianity—with an immutable-and-so-it-is Aristotelian animal hierarchy to parallel the immutable-and-so-it-is social order of “the society of gentlemen” and the unfortunate lower classes—existed nowhere else, and could be contradicted nowhere else, since other “religious” societies did not have those ideas in them. This underlines something that often happens: people from distinct cultures can say they understand something (like evolution, or Christian theological formulas) but actually understand radically different things, often because they are unconscious of what their own culture teaches them (no Englishman would have accepted his culture had an exaggeratedly immutable natural theology to underscore its “great English beehive” of social order; he would have just felt some vague rightness to the world being “as God intended.”) To outsiders—viz. the rest of the world—it would be received very differently, as it hit their consciousness a glancing blow from the outside, and might be interpreted many ways or not at all. More to the point, perhaps, they’d feel no pressure to react to it, even if they don’t believe in it. A lot of cultures are very used to broadcasts from the West, but treat its products very differently from how Westerners themselves do. For most of the world, Darwinism just fades into the background of things said by officious people, hardly listened to and paid lip service to in the universities. The Anglo-evangelicalism that presents the “official” alternative to Americans is even more obscure. There is no social backlash because no social pressure is felt: if these other people want to react against “the West” of which Darwinism is a part of, they’ll find more meaningful ways to do it.

Although I know that you should call a vet first thing). What should I prepare for?","output":"There are so many potential emergencies that it’s hard to know what to suggest. You can get a basic first aid for dogs book. But you don’t want to paralyze yourself with thoughts of the ten thousand things that can happen either. Okay … —If the dog “looks sad” or “looks depressed,” that very often means the dog is sick or in pain. Pet owners frequently mistake this for an emotional thing. Unless the dog’s close companion just died, that’s quite unlikely. It’s almost always a sign that something physical is wrong. Ditto for sudden clinginess or sudden hiding under the bed. Inexplicable behavior changes are always suspicious. —If the dog throws up, no problem. Move on. Dogs throw up all the time for no big reason. But … —If the dog throws up four times in a few hours, OR has diarrhea in addition to vomiting, OR refuses food for more than half a day, OR “looks sad,” then take the dog to the vet. —Mild diarrhea is probably not a problem as long as the dog is bright, active, cheerful, and has a good appetite. Even bloody diarrhea may not be a problem as long as the dog’s behavior is cheerful and normal (stress diarrhea has blood in it). However, diarrhea combined with lethargy OR copious diarrhea that looks like raspberry jam is an emergency. Take the dog to the vet. In the latter case, don’t accept an appointment for the next afternoon. Tell them you suspect hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and you’ll be arriving in ten minutes. —Pacing, restlessness, and inability to settle is bad. For some dogs, it suggests the possibility of gastric torsion and bloat, which is VERY bad. —Lethargy is bad. Combined with inappetence, it’s worse. Those are the first signs of many serious problems, including parvo. —Teach the dog to leave power cords alone or else guard the cords somehow. It’s not okay to risk the dog electrocuting itself. —Exercise is your friend. Underexercised and bored dogs become neurotic, develop a lot of various behavior problems, and get abandoned in large numbers. Tired dogs are good dogs. Give your dog stuff to do and appropriate exercise. Training is nice too."},{"instruction":"f slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?","output":"I think it gets abolished pretty soon thereafter in any event. You cannot look at the United States in a vacuum. You have to look at it as one of a number of nations in the New World which had slavery, and abolished it. The US wasn’t the first, and it wasn’t the last. But the idea that it would have never abolished slavery, or would have maintained slavery long after everyone else had abolished it, is simply unrealistic. The last country to abolish slavery in the New World was Brazil in 1888. Whether the United States could have survived as long as Brazil did in the face of pressure from European nations is a matter of conjecture. But I struggle to see any credible case for any date after 1888. I expect more realistically it probably gets abolished in about the mid 1870s. Best guess."},{"instruction":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","output":"Although Bhutan is a neighbour and shares very close relations with India, information about the country is limited and Bhutan doesn't rank high among holiday preferences. So here's some tips for fellow Indians travelling to the 'Land of the Thunder Dragon'. Citizens of India, Bangladesh and Maldives don't have to organise their trip to Bhutan through a package with a government-approved local agent and pay the minimum tariff, set by the government. This means that travelling to Bhutan for said citizens is much cheaper, as they pay only for their actual use of services. This also means that they can organise it all by themselves, although a local agent can help much.And a guide can add much information, both on cultural tours, and especially is useful for walks, as most are without any signage. Treks in Bhutan have to be organised by a local agent, who will deal with all the logistics of the camping. DOCUMENTS Carrying a passport is ideal, though not necessary. Even a Voter's ID card is sufficient. A visa is not required either. An entry permit will be given when crossing the border. If Indian Citizens do not have passport or voter id, they can obtain an identification slip from the Indian Consulate Office by providing proof like birth certificate, aadhar card etc. The office is located in 'India House'. They take a contribution of Rs. 100 for Army Welfare Fund. Carry the photocopies of the proofs being submitted, fill up a simple application form and the identification slip will be issued in 15 mintues. TRAVELLING FLIGHTS Druk Air offers direct flights to Paro, which is the only international airport in Bhutan, from Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Bagdogra. Popular travel websites such as Yatra and Makemytrip donot offer these flights. You will need to contact the authorised Druk Air travel agent in the city closest to you (view their website for details), or call the airline office directly. Fares listed on the website are higher, for Indian citizens, they are slightly different. Also, these aren't daily flights, so when if intent to fly both ways, better to first see the flight schedule and availability and then plan the rest of your trip. Best is to let your tour operator do the booking for you. Despite being a small airline, Druk Air's service quality is quite good. You don't have any in-flight entertainment apart from their magazine, Tashi Delek, but the crew is friendly and attend your needs. Like with Indian airline companies, Druk Air offers a choice of Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian meals, without requiring you to book it beforehand. Jain food isn't available though if you need it. Catering of meals on flights departing from India is done by Taj Sats, so you can be assured of a good meal. Meals on the return flights aren't good. While travelling from Mumbai or Delhi to Paro, please request for a window seat on the left (right for the return flight). The flight path crosses by the snow capped Himalayan peaks and offers a spectacular view of Mount Kanchenjunga and Mount Everest. If you're flying from Kolkata, Bhutan Airlines, a private company, runs a Bangkok - Kolkata - Paro service. No other airlines currently operate on this route. ROAD Druk Air flights are expensive and as Indian citizens, you have the liberty of both entering and exiting the country by land. There are direct flights to Bagdogra in Northern West Bengal from Kolkata, Delhi and Mumbai and this works out cheaper. Or you can even take a train to Siliguri. From there the Jaigaon/Phuentsholing border is around 4-5 hours. Thimphu is another 5-6 hours from here and the drive uphill is beautiful. Phuentsholing offers plenty of hotel facilities for a break journey. The border between Phuentsholing on the Bhutan side and Jaigaon on the Indian side is open, so you can even cross over for some Indian food if you like. But there are some time restrictions before which you need to go back to Bhutan. The road from Bagdogra to the border is not in a good condition. For travel in Bhutan,if done individually, you can either use public buses or hire a car with driver.If a local agent is used, he'll come and receive you at the border or close to it, as by agreement ( you can ask to be picked up in Siliguri, in the west, or in Guwahati in the east). You can also take your Indian Car to Bhutan and obtain a permit for the car from the Regional Transport Office in Phuensholing for a feeof about ng 200. Cost of Petrol is cheaper by about Ng 11 in Bhutan than in India in May 2014. TOUR OPERATORS Major tour operators in India.... SOTC, [LINKED_TEXT: Thomas Cook] [URL: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g293844-c208445/Bhutan:Bhutan.For.The.Indian.Traveller.html], Kesari, Veena World, Cox & Kings, MakemyTrip etc. all have tours to Bhutan. Only Kesari and MakemyTrip offer group tours, while customised packages are available with all. Although, the catch is that bookings are only handled by local Bhutanese operators, so they need to forward your request to Bhutan. Alternatively you can deal with a Bhutanese agent directly.Trip reports with recommendations are plenty in the Bhutan forum on TA. For a customised package, it makes sense to directly contact a tour operator in Bhutan. There are many registered tour operators, a comprehensive list is available [LINKED_TEXT: here.] [URL: http://www.tourism.gov.bt/directory/tour-operator]. A local Bhutanese guide is not a must for Indian, Bangladeshi and Maldives citizens in Bhutan but if you prefer,to have your trip organised by a local travel agency, this will assign you a guide. Guides are professionally trained and are very well informed, they will accompany you throughout your visit and provide exhaustive information on not only the places you visit, but on anything you want to know about the country as whole. This becomes necessary as there is isn't any visitor information board at most places. Guides generally speak English, but quite a few understand Hindi and are able to speak basic Hindi as well. CURRENCY The local currency is the Ngultrum, which is pegged to the Indian Rupee. The rupee is also legal tender in Bhutan, so you do not need to convert any currency, rupees are accepted everywhere. Please bear in mind that though officially 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not supposed to be accepted, practically, all the establishments accept these notes. .Very few places accept cards, so it's best to carry how much ever you need, in cash. TELECOMMUNICATIONS You can get a prepaid SIM card in any shop on showing your immigration permit. Bring an unlocked phone with you. For a week long trip a 100 Rs/Nu card is sufficient. Call to India are charged at 5 Rs/Nu per minute. TRAVELLING WITHIN THE COUNTRY (Covering Paro, Thimphu, Punakha and Phobjikha) For travel in Bhutan,if done individually, you can either use public buses or hire a car with driver or drive your own Car. If you use a local agent, you'll have a car and driver, apart from the guide. Hyundai H1 is a popular tourist vehicle, which can accomodate 6, plus the guide and driver, apart from having plenty of room for luggage. Your Bhutan registered car can come to pick you up at Bagdogra or Siliguri. Alternatively, even Indian cars are allowed into Bhutan. The roads from Paro Airport to Thimphu is good and Thimphu being the capital has good infrastructure. On the way from Thimphu to Punakha, the roads are being widened for a Hydro Power Project (as of May 2014). As a result, road conditions are bad and the road is only open to traffic at fixed times during the day. Your guide will have update info regarding these timings. From Punakha to Phobjikha, the road is in a very bad condition and can be classified as Kutcha for most of the way. The drive is picturesque, but will be painful for those with motion sickness or a back problem. All roads in Bhutan have many curves and therefore the driving is slow. Roads in the Paro area are good. There are very few (if at all) restaurants and restrooms on highways, please do not be picky. FOOD AND HOTELS (Covering Paro, Thimphu, Punakha and Phobjikha) Quite a few Indian travellers are apprehensive about vegetarian food in Bhutan, but the problem is overrated. Hotels provide you with breakfast and dinner in the package and most of them will specially cook roti, dal, subzi and rice for you if it isn't there on the buffet, at no extra charge. You need to tell them in advance though. The same applies for breakfast. Do not be very picky about taste, it might not be the best, but they spare no effort in catering to your needs. Bhutanese food has vegetarian options too, if you aren't particular about sticking to Indian vegetarian. Ema Datsche is the national dish and is essentially chilies and cheese. Chillies in Bhutan are used as a vegetable and not as a spice.Vegetarian Thukpa, Bathup and Momos are other options. Shops in Thimphu and Paro were well stocked with packaged foods... juices, namkeen etc. and brands are predominantly Indian ones, so you won't face a problem finding your favourite product. You can even buy a bottle of pickles for your meals since you may find the food a bit bland for Indian tastes. But do stock up on what you need for the long road journeys, you won't get anything on the way. For lunch, there are Indian restaurants in Thimphu and Paro. In Thimphu, Chula, behind Taj Tashi serves good Indian food, while in Paro, Sonam Trophel in the main market serves both Indian and Bhutanese. On the way to Punakha, you can have Bhutanese food in the restaurant at Dochula Pass and again at the entry to the walk up to Chime Lakhang. You can read up on these places and more on Tripadvisor itself. Keep in mind that many hotels in Bhutan, including some high end ones, won't provide you a TV in the room. WiFi is available at some. Electric kettles are provided, but some places won't give you tea/coffee/sugar/milk powder. Please check up on these based on your requirement. MISCELLANEOUS DOS AND DON'TS (Courtesy: Heavenly Bhutan Travels) Taking pictures inside the alters of dzongs, temples and monasteries is strictly prohibitedTake off your caps/hats inside dzongs, temples and in front of the national flagWear full length, long sleeved clothes while visiting dzongs, temples, monasteries, schools and any government institutionsWalk clockwise while crossing dzongs, temples, monasteries, prayer flags and other religious artifactsPlease seek permission before clicking other people or religious itemsDo not give sweets, money, pencils, pens etc. to the childrenAlthough Bhutan is safe, please keep your valuable items safeThere are a lot of stray dogs in Bhutan. Do not tease them as they aren't friendly. Barking dogs are also a nuisance at night in several areasPublic display of affection is uncommon in Bhutan. Kindly refrainSmoking in public places is prohibitedBuying of antiques from Bhutan is strictly monitored by customs. Please insist on a cash memo/original bill while purchasing THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE Bhutan is really like no other! Do not expect it to provide the commercial pleasures of a run-of-the-mill Indian hill station. It's completely non-commercial and unspoilt (the way it should be). Visually, it's very appealing. Government rules dictate that buildings, right down from palaces and monasteries to apartment blocks need to conform to the traditional architectural style and the overall effect is very impressive. The people are trustworthy and friendly and ever ready to break into a smile. The mountains, forests and rivers are in pristine condition. The cities are clean and the traffic (whatever little there is) is well organised. People say that a holiday in Sikkim or Ladakh offers a similar experience at a lower cost. But no, Bhutan is altogether unique experience and well worth the extra cost!"},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter.

If the only time you touch base with your manager to get feedback on your performance is on a yearly basis, your boss will only remember a couple of the big things you shined on, but likely every major thing you fucked up. If you're not pulling your weight or performing where expected, you also wont have time to course correct or improve on your weak areas. Ideally, the more times you're meeting with your manager, means more feedback you're getting, more records of good performance, and more opportunities to ask for a change in compensation, assuming you can justify your deserving of it. The best companies do this bi-monthly or at least quarterly. Note: If you don't look forward to performance reviews, you probably aren't performing very well.. If this doesn't work out, the other thing to consider is trading up. When it's time to move on, avoid lowering you salary requirements as must as possible. Do not undervalue yourself EVER. The line I always use is really straight forward when asked about salary: \\"At my last employer, where I was a [job title], I earned a base salary of [amount I was paid annually + 5-10k], and also had [benefits, lunches, perks etc..] included. \\" It's important to present it in this manner, so they know that other companies are willing to pay for your value. Adding at least 5-10k above your last salary, instead of saying \\"My salary requirement is [x]\\" also ensures that even if they just match your last salary, you're going to end up making more at each new job. Final negotiation suggestion (for a new job only): Ask for a signing bonus that is paid upfront, but contingent on your staying for at least 1 year. This is one of those \\"we both show each other we're serious\\" kind of things, that is low risk for the company to agree to. If you stay a year, you add lots of value, and the extra 10k is only a one-time thing they had to pay (much like the fees they pay for recruiters), and if you don't stay, then you have to pay back the difference based on how many months you were there.

On top of that, opera usually focuses on the singing rather than the acting, while musical theater focuses on both. Famous operas include Dido and Aeneas, Le Nozzi di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Siegfried, etc. [LINKED_TEXT: Singer Song Writer | Famous Vocal Coaches] [URL: http://www.stephaniethompsonint.com/famous-singer-writer]"},{"instruction":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021. Is this true?","output":"It’s crackpot bullshit. Just like “Genesis the Talking Snake” and “God’s Magic Apple Tree”."},{"instruction":"the resource curse a myth?","output":"Yes. Resource Curse is a huge crock of shit. Never in human history has a country been poor for having too many resources. Even just saying it out loud one has to recognize the ridiculousness of the idea. The problem is not, and has never been, too many resources. The problem is internal markets. If a resource-rich country has the capability to refine and absorb many of its resources internally, it can gain lots of wealth from having those resources. If a resource-rich country can't refine/absorb a lot of those resources internally, it then must export them raw at lower prices, and thus gains less wealth. (The third option is: have a really low population and export tons of raw resources. Because of the low population the wealth can be spread around effectively. This is what the Gulf States do) I don't like to pick on countries but I think this is a good comparison: USA and Nigeria. Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa. In the economic space, the country is (in)famous for its oil output. In many ways Nigeria is one of the poster children for the resource curse. Given its oil production (among other things), some feel that the country shouls be more developed than it is now. One way thay people explain that seeming paradox is the Resource Curse. But look at the USA. USA leaves Nigeria in the dust as far as oil production goes, and it has done so for quite a while -- even before fracking got big. In fact, the USA has one of the largest and most diverse resource bases on Earth, far beyond most developing and developed countries. But no one in their right mind would say that America has the “Resource Curse.” Why? USA has a huge consumer and industrial base capable of refining and/or absorbing its resources. Nigeria does not. Therr are lots of reasons for that, but a “Resource Curse\\" ain't one of them. Having a ton of resources in your borders is actually great… if you have the industrial capacity to use those resources. And exporting those resources to acquire capital to build the industrial capacity is a possibility -- this is what countries like the USA and Russia/USSR did historically, and they both had industrial booms from it. Soviet First Five-Year Plan was built on mass resource exports Resource Curse is nonsense. Again: “we are poor because we have too many resources\\" or its implication “we are rich because we have no resources” literally makes no sense. The world isn't that ironic."},{"instruction":"What are the causes for fluctuations of the value of cryptocurrency?","output":"Small market new product…. it’s price discovery"},{"instruction":"Android phones show a small icon if a tracking app is installed with or without the owner's knowledge, does Apple have a similar icon or notification?","output":"Android phones don’t, unless the tracking app puts a small icon on the screen."},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"Fred feared his wife Rhonda wasn't hearing as well as she used to and he thought she might need a hearing aid.

We were doing some heavy petting and I touched a breast and we laid on top of each other with clothes mostly on. About a week later she called me on the phone crying and told me she was pregnant. I was flabbergasted as she had been very resistant to go much past first base with me. I blurted out, ‘Pregnant by whom?!’ She said, ‘By you silly.

Here, you must take the first point that Narayana is an energetic form in which the unimaginable God (Parabrahman) got merged. Similarly, Brahma and Shiva are also energetic forms in which the unimaginable God got merged. These three forms can be said as the basic eternal address of God since the unimaginable God never exits from these three forms. The reason for such conclusion is that the unimaginable God is defined as that one entity, which does creation, control and destruction of this world. This definition is given by the Veda (Yato vaa imaani...), the Brahma Sutras (Janmaadyasya...) and the Gita (Prabhavah Pralayastathaa…, Mayi sarvamidam..., te mayi...). Hence, all these three forms are mediated Parabrahman only. In such case, you can take any one of these three in the sense of Parabrahman. Narayana is Parabrahman. Brahma and Shiva are Narayana or Parabrahman only. Here, the world Narayana stands for Parabrahman only and not to the specific external energetic form. One form can never be another form just like one human being can’t be another human being since each human being has its own specific form. Forms of a swan and a parrot are made of sugar. Each item is having a seed of cashew nut in it. Now, if you say that the parrot is swan, it can have two meanings: 1) The word parrot represents the external formless sugar so that the word parrot stands for such formless sugar. When you say that parrot is swan, it means that both are made of the same formless sugar externally. Similarly, if Narayana stands for the energy present in His external form, it means that both Narayana and Brahma are having external forms made of the same common formless energy. Similarly, you can take Shiva in the place of Brahma. 2) The word parrot stands for the internal cashew nut seed and here both parrot and swan have the same internal cashew nut. Similarly, if Narayana stands for Parabrahman both Narayana and Brahma have the Parabrahman in their energetic forms. In this sense Narayana stands for Parabrahman. Therefore, you must take the word Narayana either for the general formless energy existing in external form or you must take word Narayana for the internal Parabrahman while speaking that Brahma and Shiva are Narayana. In this context, you must not take word Narayana for its specific external form of energy. If you take the sense of specific external form only, then this context disappears and the result is that Narayana is Narayana, Brahma is Brahma and Shiva is Shiva. You must learn to take proper sense of the world in a suitable context. If you take other sense of other context, the present context gets cracked with contradiction. If you take this specific form as Narayana, objection comes in the very first step that one specific form can’t be the other specific form. The one Parabrahman exists in all these three divine forms without any internal division. This concept is well explained by the form of God Dattatreya. This form is only one entity like Brahma or Narayana or Shiva. At the same time, this form has three faces of Brahma, Narayana and Shiva seen simultaneously. This form gives the meaning of the definition of Parabrahman that one entity only called Parabrahman is doing all the three works (creation, ruling and destruction) as indicated by one person having the three faces of creator (Brahma), Ruler (Narayana) and destroyer (Shiva). The above statements given by you are from prayer on Narayana in the Veda. By saying that Narayana is Brahma and Shiva, it only means that the Ruler-Parabrahman in Narayana is the Creator-Parabrahman in Brahma and is Destroyer-Parabrahman in Shiva. Here, the devotees approaching Parabrahman through the specific external form called Narayana and is not simply approaching and sticking to the external form only. If the devotee sticks to the external form of Narayana only, he is Veera Vaishnava (conservative and rigid devotee of Vishnu) and if the devotee sticks to Parabrahman in Narayana only, he is Vaishnava (a devotee of Vishnu with analytical spiritual knowledge). In any sub-religion of Hinduism and in any religion of the world, both types of devotees invariably exist. Our sincere effort is to convert the first type of devotees to the second type of devotees to avoid criticism of other sub-religions in Hinduism and other religions in the world forgetting universal peace. When you say that Indra is Narayana, you should take the word Indra in its root verbal sense. Indra means the Lord or God. The word Indra comes from the root word ‘Idi’, which means Lordship (Eishvarye). You can take any incarnation (energetic or human) of Parabrahman as Indra since we address every incarnation with the prefix word ‘Lord’. Even Brahma or Narayana or Shiva or Dattatreya can be called as Indra or Lord. In this way, you can interpret this statement as calling every incarnation having Parabrahman in it as Indra or Lord. After saying that Brahma, Narayana and Shiva are Lords, the Veda proceeds to say that not only these three, but also any other incarnation is Narayana or Parabrahman. But, if you take Indra as mere deity (ordinary soul in energetic body) present in the energetic form, having certain mystic powers along with some duties allotted by Parabrahman, the above first sense of first mode of proposition can’t be taken. You have to take the help of Sanskrit grammar-rules giving various senses for modes of propositions (Vibhakti). When you say that Brahma is Narayana or Parabrahman, it comes to be the first mode (Prathamaa vibhakti), which says that the two are one and the same. If you say that he is Rama, there are no two entities as he and Rama. It indicates identity of both as one. You can use this mode even if two entities exist and become inseparable as one. Current and wire are two entities. When I say that the wire is current, it means both merged and result is only one entity called as electrified wire. In this sense, we can take that the energetic form Brahma and Parabrahman are merged together to result in Lord Brahma. Similarly, Narayana and Shiva. Here the first sense (Taadaatmya) of merge to become single item is to be taken in the case of Brahma or Narayana or Shvia or Dattatreya or any energetic or human incarnation. Here, the word Indra can stand for Dattatreya also indicating the single Lord or Parabrahman existing in all incarnations of God. The second sense of this first mode is control of one item by the other item (tadadhina prathamaa). Salutations to Shri Ramanuja Aacharya for projecting this sense of first mode while explaining “all this world is Brahman” (Sarvam khalvidam Brahma). Similar Vedic statement exists in this context also “All this world is Narayana” (Narayana evedam sarvam). Here, if we take first sense, it shall mean that all this world is God. If it is so, bad should not appear in any part of the world. Similarly, no ignorance must exist anywhere in the world. Narayana also means abode of spiritual knowledge and there should not be lack of knowledge anywhere in this creation. All these objections don’t admit the first sense that God and world are one and the same item. This concept belongs to atheism, for whom there is no God other than this world. In order to remove all these objections, Ramanuja took the second sense of first mode interpreting that this entire world is under the control of God. If you take Indra as a deity only having several defects like going to beat Lord Shiva with his thunder weapon, cheating Ahalya, raining continuously against Lord Krishna etc., you can’t say that such Indra is God. In this case, you have to take the second sense and interpret that the deity Indra is under the control of God. Similarly, sides like East are under the control of God. In the above simile of swan and parrot a cashew nut existing in any one of these two is compared to Parabrahman. This simile holds good if you are rigid that Parabrahman is in the soul of incarnation only due to which soul can be called as God but not its body. However, this is not valid since Parabrahman pervades all the soul and external body equally as said in the Veda (Antarbahischcha...). Since God is also in the body of boy Krishna, that tender body could lift the big mountain due to Its unimaginable nature. In such case, the above said cashew nut taken as its powder mixed with sugar exists all over the parrot or swan. ===="},{"instruction":"w do you feel knowing I have your IP address?","output":"Wow, you have a number assigned by a network that changes every time I turn off my router.

In grad school, I worked as a waitress and know that people who often left more than the traditional amount made my day, as an unexpected gift. We aren’t extremely wealthy but it’s still nice to be able to pay it forward. I’ll give two quick stories. One time, we were out on a family vacation and stopped in at a seafood dive for dinner. The waitress was very kind to my young son and we were chatting with her. It turns out it was her 30th anniversary that day and I was all, “Why are you here and not celebrating?” But of course, Saturdays are one of the best days for tips, and her husband was having some health issues. We tipped 250 on a 40 bill with the note, “Please enjoy a nice dinner on us. Happy anniversary!” and tried to leave before she knew. But my son left a stuffy so we went back. She gave me a big hug. Another time, I was at a nice restaurant, out with my girlfriends celebrating a birthday. There was a young waiter who was very kind and we heard him talking with one of the other tables as he was working his way through college. We tipped 100% on that bill, leaving cash for the tip. While we were waiting for the valet to bring our cars, he came out of the restaurant with the money, thinking we’d made a mistake. The main reasons we do it when we can is because with where we are now, we’ve worked hard and are lucky enough not to be scraping by, so it’s nice to share that with others. We can’t take it with us when we go, so why not use it to spread some joy. It’s the same reason we donate to charity and gift nice things in our local Buy Nothing group.

How do they compare to characters from Marvel or DC? What are some of their most impressive feats?","output":"OK, I must get this out of the way first: Compared to the characters found in Marvel and DC, the Rangers don’t pass muster. There are no reality warpers, aside from Lord Drakkon. Maybe Dark Specter and Maligore, although we never got to see the extent of their abilities. And they’re enemies anyway, so immaterial to the question at hand. So, Drakkon was the most powerful Ranger ever, and he had reality altering ability. But even still, Drakkon got defeated, and it was his own fault. The Tommy that was defeated and haunted Drakkon had been quietly finding the Rangers that Drakkon defeated, and brought them back. With the help of the Emissaries, beings who act on behalf of the enigmatic Morphin Masters. So now it’s on again. For the final time. But now there’s a plan. They know what must be done. So Drakkon was defeated, all because at the end of the day, he was still Human. For all his power, he got selfish. He wanted adulation. He wanted ultimate power. He wanted to be seen as the savior. And he was willing to kill to get it, and rule with an iron fist. He had the arrogance of Namor or Dr. Doom, but had none of the wisdom. This was the strongest Ranger ever. With the Heart of the Master, he was able to destroy the multiverse, and rebuild it as he saw fit. Sure, you can say that Owen Reece is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, and you’d be right. But he alone would be more than enough to destroy Drakkon. He wouldn’t be enough for the Molecule Man, who made even Galactus fear for his existence. The same Galactus who can shrug off the most powerful attacks from the likes of Odin. Galactus, who was more than enough for Thor, who’s his Herald, and has the Thorforce. And speaking of the Rune King, arguably Thor’s most powerful form (can’t speak to Necro Thor, hence the arguably qualifier,) he was able to defeat Those Who Sit Above in Shadow, whom Odin couldn’t. Those Who Sit Above in Shadow were said to be the Gods to the Gods. Ancient beings older and considerably more powerful even than Odin and the other Skyfathers. They were responsible for the never ending cycle of Ragnarok, and Thor ended it right there, at that moment. He deafened TWSAIS, and destroyed Yggdrassil, the World Tree. If Drakkon had been a bit more imaginative, maybe, and that’s a strong maybe, he’d be on this level. But he was ironically weak. Weakness was the very thing he claimed to have shed. Yet for all his power, he sought adulation. “Pride goeth before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.” Pride fell many before him, and he was no different. There are other Marvel characters who’d give him fits, such as the Marquis of Death, the Chaos King, and Jim Jaspers, for starters. DC have their own reality warpers, and they can defeat Drakkon, too. His problem was he lacked vision. Why bother rewriting reality itself, if all you’re going to do is have everyone bend the knee? That’d get real boring, after awhile. And it eventually foments chaos and rebellion. On another note, the BOOM! Comics are awesome. Too bad Saban didn’t wait and adapt them for the new movie, instead of creating that 2017 abomination. The comics make everyone competent. Babboo and Squat are menacing, Rita plays mind games with everyone, and the green chaos energy was brilliant. The mind warped Kimberly reminded me of Psycho Pink. The only Psycho Ranger who was actually able to kill a Ranger. As psychotic as Psycho Blue and Psycho Red were, it was Psycho Pink who ultimately completed her task. Drakkon’s Kim, aka the Ranger Slayer, reminded me of Psycho Pink. Even after she was freed from Drakkon’s control. That’s how great these comics are. The greatest Ranger feats are probably the following: • Defeating Ivan Ooze- Ivan Ooze was an ancient enemy that was far beyond any Power Rangers villain up to that point. Master Vile wouldn’t be as dangerous, and he was able to steal and temporarily the Zeo Crystal. The Machine Empire would be horrible, but even they wouldn’t come close to killing Zordon. Ooze did so with very little effort, showing just how dangerous he was. The Rangers were able to defeat him, something their predecessors couldn’t do 6,000 years ago. • Resurrecting Zordon with the Ninjetti powers- This was a power not shown in Power Rangers before, or since. The Great Power, which was only shown in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie, had the potential to do many things the Rangers couldn’t before. One such thing was the ability to resurrect Zordon, who’d passed while the Rangers were on their quest to get power to defeat Ooze. • Defeating Astronema during the Countdown- In the in Space season finale, which was supposed to be the series finale, Astronema had marshaled her truly massive forces, and spread them across the universe, striking any place that were part of the forces of light. Eltar, Edenoi, Aquitar, it didn’t matter where it was. There were Piranhatrons, Z Putties, Tengas, and Quantrons alike. There were warlords, like Divatox, Lord Zedd, King Mondo, and Rita, all attacking. Things were looking very bleak for Earth, which had been slated for destruction by Astronema, after she felt they were hiding the Rangers from her. But they showed up, and eventually defeated her. The Legendary Battle from Super Megaforce pales in comparison. These are the most impressive Ranger feats that come to mind."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Yes self confidence helps a person very much and can a key role in the success of the person.

Germany was now fighting the 2 most prestigious and powerful militaries in open combat on the offensive. Now during the preliminary planning period for the offensive many German generals came up with a reimagining of the shleifen plan of WW1.

The plan suggested feint attack into Belgium engage the British and French army in Belgium then thrust through the Ardennes region of Luxembourg then cut up towards Calais and surround the BEF and French armies. Now this plan was risky because blitzkreig had shown some deficiences it created very long supply lines and usually left support units scrambling to keep up with the tanks as most still used horse for transportation. With the plan if the British or French realized this move to early they could cut back and counter attack. Also the Ardennes is a very heavily forested region making it very hard for tanks to pass. Slowing the attack making discovery all the more likely. This plan allowed for the Germans to go around the maginot line and surround the entirety of the British army and a large portion of the French and despite its risks it worked. The attack was launched on the 10th of May 1940 the Germans had the BEF surrounded at Dunkirk by the 26th but the British were saved by the main flaw of blitzkreig, supply lines.

It doesn’t take much thought to work out that there is no point going through all the rigmarole of calling on God to perform a test if the outcome of the test is to be determined by a drug.

How can I keep going along with my diet?","output":"Most diets are designed to lose weight over the short term and have a focus on weight and not holistic health—as in nutrition and disease prevention/healing through whole plant foods. Consequently, most diets use caloric restriction and just eating less of the food that naturally leads to weight gain. Which will lead your body craving and needing more. Now, a caloric deficit is necessary to lose weight. Yet one can and ideally achieves this through actually eating more! The key to losing weight isn’t eating less, but actually eating MORE of the right foods. vegetarians, especially vegans, have consistently shown to have lower and normal BMI’s compared to omnivores or pescatarians for the main reason that they eat more fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in calories. By eating more fruits and vegetables you can eat more, fill up your stomach, and satisfy your hunger and nutritional needs, while still reaching your weight goals. a clear strategy can give us our best results. But diets often fail because they are meant to. When trying to maintain our weight it is best to approach it from an education and holistic health mindset then trying to punish ourselves just to lose a few pounds at any consequence. This is all of course easier said than done. Knowing that we should do something is NOT that same as understanding why we should do it or how to do it. But those answers are only for those who are willing to help themselves by asking for help and to Eat the Forbidden Fruit 🍎"},{"instruction":"What do you think about TVF's new show Kota Factory?","output":"TVF’s KOTA FACTORY The Best of KOTA FACTORY !!

What is the difference in the usage in the context?","output":"At first, let me explain the difference between present perfect continuous and past perfect continuous tense. Case I — Present Perfect Continuous Tense: Suppose, I started writing on Quora today at around 6:30 pm and I am still writing here now (at 8:19 pm). Therefore, I shall say: I have been writing on Quora today since 6:30 pm. Case II — Past Perfect Continuous Tense Suppose, I started writing here today at 6:30 pm and continued writing till 7:30 pm. However, I am not writing here now (at 8:19 pm). Therefore, I shall say: I had been writing on Quora today from 6:30 pm till 8:19 pm. Therefore, you can understand that: Present Perfect Continuous Tense:denotes an action that began some time in the recent past and is still continuing at present. Past Perfect Continuous Tense:denotes an action that had began some time in the past and continued for a certain period of time. It is not continuing now (at present). Also, we use since to denote a particular point of time and for to denote a certain period of time while using these tenses. Simple Trick — You can remember it using a simple trick. Both the tenses denote actions that began in the past but: Present perfect continuous: still continuing at present.Past perfect continuous: continued for a certain period in the past.

This is the easiest diet in the world; it is called \\"Eat-Less\\". I started a diet 18 months ago, but that fell by the wayside. I now have my head screwed on correctly, and I intend to lose the weight that I need to. From my personal experience, being obese has just become so much a part of me that I don't notice it that much any longer. The only time I may notice it is when I go to the Oversize section at clothing retailers to buy clothes. I think that the biggest mistake that society makes is type-casting obese people as being lazy which is the furthest thing from the truth. My personality dictates that what gets said behind my back is of no interest to me. If you cannot say something to my face, then \\"take it from whence it comes\\". The question \\"Why are you obese\\" never gets asked, as it has already been answered; you eat too much. There is no consideration that obesity may be a physiological problem. We cannot change how people think about the obese, but we can change the most important factor here; ourselves. We see how the thin get treated better, and we have it within our power to change our body shape so that we will be picked out in a crowd, instead of being marginalized. Luckily, we can go on a diet and lose weight, no matter how difficult that may be, but those that have preconceived ideas of the obese, or anything for that matter, are destined to remain a**holes until they die."},{"instruction":"What happened to the Balkh and Badakshan Subahs established by Shah Jahan?","output":"It doesn’t make much sense to refer to these regions as the Balkh Subah and Badakhshan Subah given that the Mughal Empire was never able to consolidate its hold over these regions. The Blue Mosque or Masjid-i-Kabud in Mazar-i-Sharif in Balkh (Afghanistan). It was initially constructed by Sultan Husayn Bayqarah Mirza, the Timurid ruler of Khorasan, in the 15th century. The Hindu Kush mountains had served as the traditional boundary between the spheres of influence of the Mughal Empire of Hindustan to the southeast and Uzbek Khanates of Central Asia to the northwest, since the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (1556 – 1605). The Mughal Empire would launch an ambitious military campaign during the reign of Shah Jahan (1628 – 1658) to expand north of the Hindu Kush towards Central Asia. The Mughals, under the pretence of bringing law and order to the region during a period of internal strife amongst the Uzbeks, invaded and captured the regions of Balkh and Badakhshan in 1646. The forces of the Mughal Empire - under the command of Aurangzeb (initially Murad Baksh) - were able to defeat the Uzbek forces in direct confrontations. However, they failed to consolidate their hold over the region. The Uzbeks resorted to raiding and harassment; that is to say skirmishing and guerrilla tactics to weaken the Mughal forces in the region. The conflict devastated the region, which was costing the Mughal Empire far more than the two provinces were worth in revenue. The large Mughal army, unable to live off the land, had to resort to expensive supply lines from Kabul. The Uzbeks were unwilling to concede the region. This stalemate of a military campaign would go on for about two years (1646 – 1647). Aurangzeb, upon orders of Shah Jahan, would lead the Mughal retreat towards Kabul. The regions of Balkh and Badakhshan were returned to the Uzbeks once more. The Mughal Empire, despite massive losses in the military and heavy financial costs, had nothing to show for it at the end. This is why I said that it doesn’t make much sense to refer to these regions as the Balkh Subah and Badakhshan Subah. The Mughal Empire captured these regions from the Uzbek Khanates for about two years (1646 – 1647) in total, before being forced to return it. Even during this small time period, the Mughals were never able to consolidate their hold over the region. These regions were Mughal provinces only in name.

Those that put on the act after the cheating, rebuilding on a bunch of lies and half truths are keeping their spouse/partner from the genuine love they deserve by keeping them in the relationship subjecting them to a life of phony reality, trust issues and triggers are usually the fate and more often than not repeat infidelity instead of setting them free so they find a genuine love.

What will be the consequences?","output":"You would get Iphone just at 650 INR…😂😂 If 1 Rupee = 1 Dollar Pros Now Pros of the situation. 1. Buying Goods will be cheaper for Indians in the International Market. Because this will make imports cheaper which is good for a developing country. 2. Buying luxurious goods will be cheaper. For example, an iphone will cost just INR 650 which is cheaper than the current market rate. 3. As import prices are cheaper, then petrol prices will be cheaper resulting in cheaper transportation cost of goods around the country. Cons Now Cons of the Situation 1. Exports will be expensive if value of Indian rupee and dollar are the same. Because Indian products will be expensive compared to other competing nations. Indian exports have been booming well in recent years. If it is expensive, why would any country buy from India when other competitors can offer the same at cheaper price. 2. There would be no foreign Investment if Rupee equals dollar. The primary reason for a foreign investment in India is the cheapest labour cost. Foreign companies will not be investing in India when the cost of labour is higher compared to other countries. 3. Service sector contributes almost 60% in GDP and give 27% employment in India. Investment in IT Sector and Service Sector which contributes huge amount for the Indian Economy will be gone if 1 Dollar is equal to 1 Rupee. Now as 1USD= 1INR why any company will pay to an employee USD 75,000 or Rs.75,000 per month if they can hire someone outside who will do the same work for USD 3000 or Rs.3000. Eventually people will loose job which will increase unemployment. 4. When money does not come into India, it will result in complete economic slowdown. 5. Outsourcing of job in India will be stopped. 6. Companies which are presently in India will start to move out as it will not be profitable for them. Similar situation happened in India during 2007-08 when dollar was strong around Rs.40, the imports were good. But the BPO and IT Sectors suffered a lot.

With no nutrients and tons of calories, it is probably the most hazardous ingredient in the modern diet, responsible for millions of deaths. Exactly what is it? What I’m talking about here is a disaccharide, the combination of glucose and fructose. It offers zero nutritive values and no health benefits. We feel comfortable with it because most of us grew up loading it on our breakfast cereal because mom said it was OK. We can give mom a break; she didn’t know any better back in the day. When we got a bit older, we ended up shoveling it in our coffee. I remember I used to add four of five spoonfuls to one mug. How I’ve avoided diabetes, I’ll never know. Refined sugar became a daily part of our lives, and we didn’t think twice about eating it. I mean, how could something sold in five-pound bags in the grocery store be so dangerous to our health? What are some common health hazards associated with sucrose? There are several: Heart Disease - Adding extra sugar to our diet can put you at higher risk of heart disease by leading to obesity, high blood pressure, and tissue inflammation. Fatty Liver Diseases - Sucrose (and other sugars) are broken down by the liver. Consuming sucrose in excess could lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Diabetes - The incidence of insulin resistance has doubled in the last 30 years. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. Insulin resistance is associated with high sucrose intake and significantly increases your risk of diabetes.Obesity - Sugar can act to trick your brain into making you still feel hungry when you would otherwise feel full. Don’t believe me? Stop all excess sugar for several weeks, then eat a donut or two. After that, you’ll become ravenously hungry.Accelerated Skin Aging - The way we age is largely due to our genetics, but our diet plays a role as well. Advanced Glycation End Products(AGEs) are the compounds stimulated by a reaction between sugar and protein inside your body that also damages collagen and elastin, the agents that provide your skin with elasticity and youthfulness. The good news is that if one wants to, it is relatively easy to eliminate added sugars from our diet.

To my knowledge, there were not any election sites that predicted a 100% chance for a Clinton win. Even if they predicted 99%+ odds for a Clinton victory, that wouldn’t prove them wrong, as things with less 1% chance of happening, happen all the time. Of course, while this fact demonstrates their possible accuracy, it also demonstrates a pretty serious flaw. Probability predictions for presidential elections are fundamentally unfalsifiable. If someone had predicted that Trump had a 99% chance of winning, I’d say they were probably BSing and got lucky. But the election results didn’t prove them wrong, nor would it have proved someone predicting a 99% chance for Clinton wrong. If the results cannot prove who was right between those two extremes, they certainly cannot prove who was right between 538’s 70% chance for Clinton, and other sites giving Clinton 90%. It’d be tempting to say the results showed 538 was closer to the truth, but for all we know something with a 10% probability happened. And with presidential elections only happening once every four years, one could be making predictions for decades and still have a very small data-set. And most of the time were talking about prediction numbers in the weeks and months before a election, rather than on election day itself. These tell us that there is X percentage that Y candidate would win if the election was held on that day. But since the election is not held on that day there will be zero results to prove or falsify the prediction. Some of these sites seem really smart because they throw lots of numbers at you.

Most of the world’s 2-4 million Assyrians live around their traditional homeland, which comprises parts of northern Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran. The first Eurasian populations were established on the The Arabian Peninsula, the initial site of the out-of-Africa migrations that occurred between 125,000 and 60,000 yr ago, leading to the hypothesis that Arabs are direct descendants of these ancient peoples. According to both Judaism and Islam, Ishmael was the ancestor of the Ishmaelites and of the Arabs. Ishmael was the elder son of Abraham and the forefather of many prominent Arab tribes. Currently it gathers 22 Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria*, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Around 93% of Arabs are Muslims, while the rest are mainly Arab Christians. There are two major branches of Islam – Sunni and Shia. The overwhelming majority (87-90%) of Muslims are Sunnis; about 10-13% are Shia Muslims. Most of the ancient Persian empire is in modern-day Iran. The Persians are the predominant ethnic group of Iran who comprise over half of the population of Iran. They share a common cultural system and are native speakers of the Persian language (Farsi), which belongs to the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European language family. Medieval Persian incorporated more Arabic loanwords, had a more complex grammar, used the Arabic script with modifications, and had slightly different pronunciation compared to Modern Persian."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"Hey there! So you want to know how much you can earn with a blog, huh? Well, the truth is, it really depends on various factors. Let me share my own blogging journey to give you a better idea. I started my blog a few years ago, writing about my passion for travel and adventure. At first, it was just a hobby, and I didn't make much money. But as I kept consistently putting out valuable content and building a loyal audience, things started to change. I began to collaborate with travel companies and hotels, receiving sponsorships and freebies for promoting their services on my blog. This opened up a new stream of income. Additionally, I dived into affiliate marketing, recommending products and services I genuinely believed in, and earning a commission for every sale made through my affiliate links. As my blog gained popularity, I even started selling my own digital products, like travel guides and photography presets. All these efforts combined led to a substantial increase in my blog's income over time. Remember, blogging isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, and it takes time, dedication, and a lot of hard work. But if you're passionate about what you write, stay consistent, and focus on providing value to your audience, you'll likely see your earnings grow steadily.

Direction of Mukesh Chhabra is nice as considering his first movie. please compare this with tamil movie “96” and kannada movie “Dia” , then you can better understand a romantic movie and its IMDB rating. But also deseve good point, this movie end with a great message. Live is short and no one knows how many days left to live with loved ones. So enjoy every moment of life. Sushant Sir RIP 🙏 Thanks"},{"instruction":"What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?","output":"Where does meaning come from? Do we observe the objects that comprise reality, receiving the meaning inherent to the objects? Or do we interact with reality and observe that interaction allowing us to make distinctions about reality that are meaningful to us? That is to say, do we create the idea of the the objects we observe as a consequence of our interaction with reality? If the objects meaning is inherent to the object, then identity problems become very stick. In fact, all definition becomes a problem, but it’s just most obvious in the cases of identity. In this was of seeing reality, the ship’s Theseusness is being observed by us. The question becomes what is it about the ship that’s inherently Theseusish. The paradox demonstrates that this is not easy to answer. Maybe there is an answer, but I’m not so interested in finding it. If we decide that the meaning of objects arises out of the subjects interaction with reality, then the problem is easier to solve. The answer is that Theseus’ ship is his ship when it’s meaningful to us for it to be his ship. This allows us to hold the seemingly contradictory opinions about when it’s Theseus's ship. This answer seems to be compatible with Joshua Engel’s answer. but we took different approaches to it.

The easiest for me is aluminum. I have my favorite which is 7075T6 mainly because the chips break better than all the rest of the aluminum series. Magnesium is very easy to machine but doesn\`t dissipate the heat very well and you cannot let chips build up in the pan or scrap barrel because those fine cuts will catch fire and cannot be put out…sustained…yes, but not out until it burns itself out. Copper is not bad and tricky to get a really good finish if you have to use inserted carbide tool with factory rake and clearance angle…if you happen to have a tool & cutter grinder the angles can be to perfection. Yes, I had access to several grinders. I love machining brass because the chips will break without special tools, however, drilling brass requires a negative hook angle on the drill bit to prevent it from grabbing when breaking through a hole. All the materials mentioned can be machines with high speed or cobalt tools. Carbide can be used if sharpened right. Titanium (not mentioned) is a pleasant material to machine, and it can be machined with high-speed steel as long as the cutting angles are correct. (Actually, just plain tool steel machines titanium with aluminum angles better than carbide negative rake inserted tools.)

I have been in management and leadership positions in the military and business world for forty years and I often get asked what the best lessons I have found. Surprisingly (or not) my list of lessons probably have varied to a degree, depending on when in my career it was constructed. The following lessons represent my favorite lessons on business management that I believe could make the biggest impact. If I was starting my career over and could take leadership lessons back in time with me, these are the ones I would choose: Create an environment of continuous learning It is absolutely necessary that business people be good learners. They need to instill this in all their team. They must learn from their mistakes. To be most successful, managers must acknowledge, understand, and improve on their shortcomings. And they must encourage their team to also focus on continuous learning. Be a multiplier Multiplier business managers know that at the apex of the intelligence hierarchy is NOT the lone genius. Rather, it is the genius who knows the importance of bringing out the smarts and capabilities in everyone on the team. Related material: [LINKED_TEXT: Lessons Learned in Life … Class Continues Daily] [URL: http://digitalsparkmarketing.com/employeeslessons-learned-in-life/] Build connections Both managers and leaders know their job with their teams is about building lots of connections. They make people feel they have a stake in common problems. Encourage feedback It is vital that you let your team know you are interested and will listen to their concerns and ideas and contribute to solutions to any and all problems. Offer recognition and always share success Focus on building team confidence by publicly recognizing their efforts and achievements. Think of it this way; anything is possible if you share the glory. Giving others a chance to claim credit is an easy, and effective, way to magnify results. Be decisive One of the key jobs of a manager is to be an effective decision-maker. Employees are never comfortable with managers who make slow decisions and frequently change their minds. Quality managers make decisions quickly and stick with them. Building and maintaining trust Always do what you say and set good examples. Demand from yourself the same level of professionalism and dedication that you expect from others. Trust, once broken, is seldom restored to its original state. It is the most fragile yet essential attribute of leadership and management.

They both have advantages over one another in terms of appearance, durability, etc. Marble vs. Granite Durability: [LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://rynestone.in/collections/granite-manufacturers-and-suppliers-in-india] is more resilient and long-lasting than marble. The hardest natural stone is frequently compared to marble. Due to its heat resistance and ability to easily handle hot cookware, it is perfect for kitchen tops. Marble is also susceptible to color fading and dulling over time. Unlike stains, which may be recovered, a stone that has lost its brightness cannot. The fundamental problem with marble is that this process is ongoing. Both natural stones are reactive to acidic substances, although marble is more porous due to its metamorphic features. As a result, spills, especially those involving acidic liquids like fruit juices and wines, can quickly harm marble. Granite and marble have quite different appearances from one another. Due to the inclusion of feldspar, mica, and amphibole in the granite, the stone's color variation appears as speckling all over. Marble, on the other hand, has a greyish or cream color and has veins running through it. Contaminants like iron oxide are frequently to blame for marble veining. Applications: Granite is more appropriate for kitchen counters and hallways where there is heavy foot traffic while marble is more suitable for locations with lesser foot traffic, such as restrooms. Since marble has a distinctive, bright appearance, it is perfect for surfaces that see less traffic. Cost: Professional installation of granite and marble is required due to the weight of the slabs. While high grade granite is less expensive than marble, both materials typically cost 50 to 100. The type of tile utilized, the difficulty of the job, and the stone's quality, however, all affect the final price. Maintenance: Sealants are applied to both marble and granite to prevent etching and stains. Professionals recommend sealing marble twice a year, although granite only needs it done every two years. Marble requires sealing much more frequently. Depending on how frequently the stone was cleaned and how frequently it was used, it may or may not need to be resealed."},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"Ever put your finger through a wet paper towel?"},{"instruction":"WW2?

My problem with the Avengers has been they obviously had Scarlett Johansson in a tight catsuit for eye-candy. She didn’t have super powers, and she looked nothing like the Natasha from the comics, but she was always there. Note: Natasha wasn’t an original Avenger in the comics, nor was she ever with them for very long. Wasp and Wanda were the OG female Avengers. Neither Liz Olson nor Brie Larson is hootchie-mama hot (although they maintain a low-cut bustier on Wanda.) Thank God. These two women are certainly lovely, but they are serious actors first.

The modern elements are much less disruptive and far smaller volumes than in the past. And for every panic-stricken article written about lithium shortages there are ten articles on the back pages of publications most people don’t read about alternative technologies which allow storage without lithium at all. Same for all the other rare elements. And there are some stories about new production in other countries. You may not know that Australia, not Africa and not China, is presently the world’s largest source of lithium. These elements are found many places. Humans just tend to go where the concentrations are highest and the formations are easiest to exploit first. I’m not in any way a fan of extractive industries. But if we want a sustainable world we have to build one that people will accept. They aren’t going to accept going back to horse and buggy days, as much as the Republicans talk about that in their failed effort to slow progress. So we might want to tolerate an electric car which needs between five and 165 pounds of lithium, as a pleasant alternative to a car which burns that much weight and volume of gasoline every couple of days for the entire time it is on the road.

His eyes were gooey and he was limping. He was already 2 years old so I knew this day was coming. With small animals, they can go downhill quickly. So I called my mom and asked if I could take him to a vet. Unfortunately, the only vet with an opening who also treated small animals was an hour drive away. I didn’t want my little friend to suffer for possibly days, waiting for him to pass. Now, I don’t drive for medical reasons and my mom had a prior appointment so her boyfriend offered to take me. They’ve been together for 20+ years, so he’s basically my step-dad. I’ve always loved him and respected him, he’s been nothing but wonderful to my family. But that day I was humbled by his actions, and discovered an even deeper respect and appreciation for him I didn’t know was even possible. He drove me and my hamster to the emergency vet an hour away and never complained once. We got there at 11am and didn’t get home until 8pm. My hamster was considered low-priority so they called me shortly after admitting him and told me that while he was stable, they still wanted the vet to look at him but would be a few hours of waiting. When I asked my step-dad if he would rather just go home, he told me he would do whatever I wanted to do. He told me to not worry about him because he knows how important my animals are to me. I apologized and he insisted there was nothing to apologize for. We waited in the car for hours and eventually they called me again to say it would be even more of a delay. Again, I asked him if he would rather leave and again, he told me “It’s completely up to you, if you’d like to stay then I will stay with you”. I decided to stay because I knew it was time for my hamster to go, and didn’t want to bring him home only to slowly suffer. My step-dad then took me out to dinner wherever I wanted to go and of course, insisted on paying for everything. When we called my mom to tell her we would be there for awhile, she urged him to take me home to which he replied “she wants to stay so I’ll stay with her. I don’t mind at all.” I kept apologizing, and he would just say “there’s nothing to apologize for. This is important to you.” He never complained once. Not at having to drive an hour away, not for having to wait for 8 hours in a car, not for feeding me, nothing. He never said I was wasting his time or that he had other plans for the day. He never said it was a hassle or silly of me to care so much about a 10 hamster. To him it was just the same as if I had asked him to take me around the corner to the drive thru. Later on he even took me to a gas station to get snacks (which of course he paid for). When I finally got the news that my hamster was on the way out and I needed to make a decision, he started to tear up because he saw me crying (he wasn’t really an animal person, he never had a pet until a few years ago). Of course I made the decision to let my little friend cross the rainbow bridge peacefully. When we got home, I went upstairs to get a sturdy box to bury him in our yard. Without prompting, my step-dad got a shovel and a flashlight and dug a deep hole in the dark right next to where I buried my other hamster years ago. I was fully prepared to do the work myself but he did it for me ahead of time. He patiently waited while I cried and said my goodbye, and let me throw the first pile of dirt over the box. When I told him I wasn’t sure if I was strong enough to fill in the rest, he took the shovel and filled it in for me, packing it down better than I would have been able to so that animals wouldn’t dig him up. He hugged me and asked me if there was anything he could do for me. But he had already done so much, probably more than he even knows. I realized that day that he did so much for my family and I and has never asked for anything in return. He treated me with respect and understanding even though he probably didn’t understand my attachment to such a small creature. He handled it all with patience, strength, and care. It was the most masculine, upstanding thing I have seen and I could not be more grateful for such a wonderful father-figure. In a month he will be attending my college graduation when my own father will not be there (who suddenly claims he doesn’t like driving out of town). Even at my high school graduation, when I waited and waited for my dad to show so I could get a picture with him in my cap and gown, my step-dad made sure to be there. We have a picture of us together outside the ceremony. He’s done so much for a child that’s not even his and I feel so lucky that my mom hit the jackpot. Here he is laughing at the World’s Largest Pencil Sharpener Collection he happened to find on a trip a few years ago."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"Determining the best ways to invest money depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and personal circumstances. Here are some general investment strategies that are often considered: Diversify your portfolio: Spreading your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities, can help reduce risk. Diversification can be achieved through mutual funds, ETFs, or by investing directly in various assets.Invest in low-cost index funds: Index funds are designed to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer broad market exposure, low fees, and are suitable for long-term investing. This approach aims to capture the overall market's growth rather than trying to beat it through active stock selection.Consider dollar-cost averaging: Instead of investing a lump sum at once, dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount regularly over time. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of market volatility by purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.Invest in tax-advantaged accounts: Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or ISAs (depending on your country), which offer tax benefits and can help grow your investments more efficiently. These accounts may provide tax deductions, tax-free growth, or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the specific account type.Consider your risk tolerance: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Riskier investments, such as stocks or venture capital, can potentially provide higher returns but also come with greater volatility and the possibility of losses. If you have a lower risk tolerance, you may prefer more conservative options like bonds or stable dividend-paying stocks.Educate yourself and consider professional advice: Stay informed about investing principles, market trends, and economic factors that may affect your investments. Consider seeking advice from financial professionals, such as financial advisors or wealth managers, who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals. Remember, investing always carries some level of risk, and there are no guaranteed outcomes. It's essential to do your research, evaluate your financial situation, and consider seeking professional advice to make informed investment decisions.

Made with tender coconut pulp mixed with condensed milk, this quick version of kheer is a brilliant addition to your daily meals. Ashok halwa (or Asoka halwa) is a delicious dessert from Tamil Nadu that is made on special occasions. One can call it a south Indian version of moong dal halwa, but the difference is that moong dal halwa is crumbly and dry while ashoka halwa is more watery with a glossy, shiny look. Muskoth halwa is prepared using Maida milk / All purpose flour milk and coconut milk. It can be called as coconut milk halwa too. Highlight of this halwa is its made without adding a drop of ghee or oil. The oil releases from the coconut milk makes the halwa glossy and flavorful. Thoothukudi macaroon is a type of macaroon from the port town of Thoothukudi, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, influenced by Portuguese.

I want them as companions for humans.","output":"For companion animals, I would recommend getting goats as long as you have the proper fencing and facilities. This is very important as goats are escape artists. They are also very smart and can be trained to be as friendly and companionable as dogs. That said, you need to be aware of natural goat behavior. They are escape artists and that lovely rose bush on the other side of the fence is usually just the right enticement to make them think about escape. They also are very good at working out how gate latches work so you need to be creative in your gate latch. A sliding one is best as they are very good at figuring out the hook and eye ones. Also you will need at least a 5 foot fence or electric. This fence needs to be sheep fencing so they cannot wiggle through it. A wire strung at their eye level is a good deterrent. Also, goats will tend to get on anything that is higher than the ground. It is a natural instinct to be able to look for predators. Old wooden cable rolls are very fun for them to play on and fun for people to watch as well. Goats are browsers so while they can do well on a grass pasture, they do better on a weedy field with lots of brush. They are masters at clearing out blackberry vines. Anyway, goats are characters as you can see from the photo below. This is from a number of years ago of our goats all lined up at the fence looking for treats."},{"instruction":"the MIT Pune good for a B.Tech?","output":"MIT Pune is a very good college for doing engineering.

To cite an example of North vs South (For most South means - Madrasi), I am reproducing the article published in a leading, prestigeous, strong fundamental, educated, English News Daily Times of India belonging to Bennet & Coleman in their Mirror. Below, one reply from a reader is also written. ——————————————————————————————————— Times of India on South Indians (Read it as “Misconceptions about South”): Quote: '˜Play it again, Sambaswami!' By Dinyar T Dastoor | Updated: May 12, 2010, 03:21 IST In the seventies, being sent to Madras by your company was like a punishment posting — pretty much like Papillon being sent to Devil’s Island — confined to a lifetime of anti-Hindi agitations and tair sadam. Till sometime back, any attempt at trying to talk in the so-called national language would instantly be met with a sharp retort of “Hindi nay!” That is, till the north Indian rupee made its appearance following which, all communication problems instantly evaporated like over-heated rasam and everybody turned into a veritable Premchand or Kalidasa, spouting shudh rashtrabhasha. After travelling in Bombay’s local trains, the ones down here have to be seen to be believed. To begin with, there’s a 20-minute wait, the speed is much slower and one can actually find a place to sit without six people standing on your foot, while a seventh tries to steal your wallet. The proverbial south Indian efficiency (and courtesy) is on display at most places from booking clerks who genuinely try to help you out and call you “sir” to medical specialists who diagnose your ailment correctly without recommending a battery of tests. (In fact, the concept of a corporatised hospital was first mooted in the south.) By way of conversation, most statements begin with “Can you do me a favour?” and end with “is it?” Sometimes they include, “Are you a north Indian/ Punjabi/ Muslim etc?” added unabashedly, without batting an eyelid. Needless to say, the term north Indian includes anything from Kutch to Kohima. Although this is unlikely to find any (Pic-Movie posters often leave you questioning who is the hero!) mention in the Lonely Planet or any of the politically correct discussions on national integration, there has always been an unsurmountable schism between the north and south; even a covert sense of hostility. Quite simply, the south thinks that the north consists of a bunch of pushy, garrulous types with more money and clout than what’s good for them, while the north feels that the south comprises a bunch of gibberish speaking, clerical techies whose sole aim is to come up north for work and subsequently get their entire clan to join them. The IT factor is of course extremely prevalent down under. It’s believed that you can’t throw a rock anywhere without hitting a techie. Then again, there are those who will actually attempt to verify the hypothesis. Don’t even attempt pronouncing the full names of people or you’ll end up missing your train. Fortunately, most names have a shorter version. (Long before Jurassic Park came up with the T-Rex, Madras came up with T-nagar and RA Puram.) Years of practice has honed the cognitive skills of local kids who, now settled in the US, regularly win spelling bee contests. (Let’s face it, for any kid who’s grown up having Thiruvalluvarnagar for a zip code, anything would be a cinch.) If there’s one thing that epitomises the city, it’s the huge cardboard cutouts of political figures like Puratchi Thalaivi “fat lady” amma and other assorted appas, bearing gargantuan hernia-inducing garlands. After several attempts at trying to unsuccessfully convince a telephone operator to talk in English, I realise that what she’s been saying, rather exasperatedly is actually, “I am talking in English!” (In fact, the credit for the original expression, “I yam what I yam,” wrongly attributed to Popeye the sailor, actually goes to Parasuram the tender coconut vendor.) Movies are big business in the south, though going by the handlebar moustaches, drooping eyelids, glazed retinas and glaring looks, it’s often difficult to tell the heroes from the villains on the posters. The south Indian heroine (whose thighs have for long been the envy of north Indian wrestlers) has come a long way. From a generously endowed, conservative, Kanjeevaram-clad amma with half the Botanical Gardens in her hair, who looked like she tucked away a good six tins of asli ghee daily; she has morphed into this demure, diminutive, Demi Moore type. What’s next — Humphrey Bogart in Casablancapuram saying, “Here’s looking at you, Kutty?” Play it again, Sambaswami! ————————————————————————————————————- One Reader’s Reply for the above article Is it fair for Ammirror to publish columns which hurts millions of people? If it is so, the below is 360 degree feedback to a column written by Mr.Dastoor \\"Play it again, Sambaswami\\" in page 24 on May12,2010. This feedback will also hurt others. 1.South India: The term south India includes atleast four states, Tamilnadu, Kerala, AP and Karnataka. Unfortunately for Mr.Dinyar, Madras is south India. It is like a blindman describing elephant, by touching hair of its tail. Whether Mr.Dinyar is aware that, Madras is Chennai now. 2.INR or NIR : INR is Indian Rupee. What is that North Indian Rupee making its appearance - while affluent South is counting remittances in of US, Singapore and Australia and Euros. In which decade he lives? Whether he is aware, there are atleast three currencies carry Tamil - there is no north Indian Rupee. 3.Blessing in Disguise:Thanks to Hindi agitations, which restricted tamilians to migrate to north due to langauage and now they emerged as global citizens spreading their wings. 4.Think Different: In chennai if anyone is speaking, shudh rashtrabhasa, untoubtedly he would have migrated from north India. [again hair of an elephant tail] 5.Recent Think Tanks: Quite simply south thinks that the north consists of a bunch of kandhu vatti [lazy people who thrive by lending money at 60 to 96% interest] joint families, who stay with their entire clan for generations and wash their sins by visiting holy places. South clerical techies often wonder how dirty these north Indian towns are - where is the question of migrating with kith and clan. Am I dreaming Butterfly or Butterfly dreams of me: 9% of people in Tamilnadu speaks telugu and 1 out of 39 elected MP from Madurai since independence is a saurashtrian representing about 2% of people. The telugu speaking descedents came from Vijayanagar protected our Temples from Muslim attacks. Saurashtra is a language similar to sweet Gujarati written with tamil alphabets and their contribution to Silk weaving is commendable. Indians are mainly farmers as majority of the people mentioned farming as a profession during last census. In this census, it will not be surprising, if freelancing will emerge as a major proffesion in North. 6.Classical Language: Ofcourse they are proud about their langauge -one of classical two languages of our holy land; unadulterated language of Lord Kartik; grammered by Agasthiya rishi to create certain vibrations; still spoken by over 60 million people - though others who cannot understand may tell gibberish. It is a simple fact that north Indians don't even attempt pronouncing the south Indian names - is it fair to expect south Indians to master so called adulterated rashtrabhasa representing our slavery.

South Indians are crazy people in seeing movies, music... A vibrant cutout industry, music & film industry of their own mother tongue are symbols of developed state - this next generation Dastoors can only grasp. 9.Still More Difficult :Mr.Dinyar find it difficult to tell the heroes from the villains on the posters. South Indians find it difficult to tell the heroes from heroines in hindi movies as both have \\"no moustaches\\". How one generation watched all \\"kapurs\\" and present generation \\"khans\\"?

This had laxer safety regulations which made building like that cheaper to build. One of those regulations meant that they needed a thinner layer of fireproofing around the shafts for key services, such as fire escapes and the central building supports. Also they could get by with fewer fire escape staircases than would be required elsewhere. (Particularly significant in the North Tower as people above the floor of impact had no way down as the staircase was blocked). The main support of the building was steel. Any Blacksmith from the dawn of the Iron Age will know that iron and steel get softer and malleable at high temperatures. When that steel is supporting twenty or thirty floors of a building above the point where it starts to get soft, it will soon cease to support. As floors come crashing down, each floor adds to the impact on the next floor down and it collapses like a series of pancakes. The planes hijacked were planes which were going to cross the Continent and had a lot of fuel on board. Jet fuel burns hot, more than hot enough for the steel supporting the building to soften enough to lost the ability to support the weight above the impact site. Appalling thogh the crime was, they were very well informed. Other tower blocks in New York would have lasted longer due to more fireproof protection, giving more people time to get out due to the additional escape routes. The World Trade Centre gave those on the upper floors next to no chance of survival."},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","output":"If one dollar will get equals to Rs.1 you can not even imagine what would be the conditions of indian economy. Our economy will completely destroyed. India is import oriented country where we Imports more compared to export. So in order to pay our high import oil, gold and other items bill we need to pay them in dollor and for it we required foreign currency reserve and to get the foreign currency we need other international market to import our good ( Export for us) for this our goods should be cheaper for this our currency value should also be lower. But suppose if one dollor is equal to one rupee then who so ever will buy the products from india same things they will buy from other country where currency rates are cheaper or else he would buy the same product from USA only. Thus our export will be lower and Import will be higher. Thus the current account deficit of our country will be no longer positive and than how we will be in the condition which we cannot even think about it. Lot of international companies and industrialists are coming and investing in India just beacuse of cheap availability of labour and factory setup. And this investment is very much required for a country like India to develop its infrastructure. Here if one rupee is equal to one dollar than why foreign companies would coming to India and will invest here instead of it they will prefer to invest in USA only or else they would go to more chepar country. For more clarity of your concept lets take an exapmle of bpo kpo services. Millions of Indians people are working in this BPO companises i.e. Genpact, Accenture, Wipro, Infosys etc. So what these companies are doing they are working for companies based on UK and USA. so why these companies in UK and US are giving jobs to india. Is it that they dont have the people to work for them? Is it, If you are thinking like that then you are wrong because If a USA company hiring a US employee than they will have to at least pay them for 4000–5000 per month whereas they get the same work done by outsourcing them to Indian BPO at low labor cost of around 300-400. So you can think how much they are saving. But the fact is that we are getting employment for millions of people for them. But the income is relevant here 300–400 is sufficent for a you g graduate.

I fail to see how taking the gender neutrality present in every single other general dating app and shelving the responsibility on women to make the first move is feminist or empowering. If a woman wants to message a man on Tinder, she can. She also has the option of waiting until a decent man messages her. Bumble literally takes away her options under the guise of feminism. Granted, there are benefits to Bumble’s approach in that women can’t just get unsolicited dick pics from anyone she herself hasn’t messages, but it’s still a loss in functionality. Requiring women to make the first move isn’t really empowering. It’s a requirement if anything is to get done. It’s like making volunteer work a graduation requirement. It’s not really volunteer work now, is it?

But you have to read to the end of the chapter and read carefully to catch it. Lot’s story ends with these same daughters raping him in a cave. So the man who went to Sodom and Gomorrah because he was driven by money, dies penniless; being raped by the same daughters that he carelessly offered up for rape. It's a powerful illustration of how important it is to interpret moments of stories in their context. Especially in Genesis which often makes it's points through subtle, dramatic irony rather than large pronouncements from on high. To further this point: Abraham is often viewed as a hero for bargaining with God in Chapter 18- seemingly making sure that God will not destroy innocent people in Sodom and Gomorrah. But Abraham's real motivation is to try and rescue his nephew Lot. And the resulting narrative proves again and again that Lot (and family) is far from innocent. Abraham's preoccupation with Lot is part of a much larger narrative, where Abraham seeks to establish his own heir rather than trusting in God’s promise of son through Sarah. The specific result of Abraham's mistrust is that the descendents of the rape of Lot are the Amonites and Moabites- who will have significant conflicts with the Israelites."},{"instruction":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","output":"Not me but the late, great Kerry Packer who was a very wealthy Australian businessman.

In India, for example, an SME is defined as a company with annual revenues of up to Rs. 250 crore (~US34 million) and a net worth of up to Rs. 100 crore (~US13.5 million). The SME IPO market in India is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and is designed to provide a platform for smaller companies to raise capital from the public and enable them to achieve greater visibility and credibility in the market. However, it's worth noting that the annual revenue threshold for SMEs can vary depending on the country and the industry.

This is more of a cult internet phenomenon than an actual real clinical thing. If you read actual case studies done on real psychopaths this becomes abundantly obvious. Their motives are much different because of the way their brain thinks so they just don’t understand what drives or motives normal people. They can manipulate because they know people will respond certain ways to emotional manipulation which may have been the way they were able to get their needs met as a child. This isn’t mystical witchcraft, there are real and logical reasons these coping mechanisms happen, it’s not because you are born with a certain type of brain or genetics, this obviously plays a role but there are usually psychological reasons maladaptive behaviors emerge and it’s usually because of maladaptive parenting and poor environments. I learned to read moods, not read people like some sort of fucking detective Sherlock Holmes or whatever but I was sensitive to moods because I was raised by a highly volatile and manipulative father who would rip your head off if he was in a bad mood or maybe let you get away with whatever if in a good mood, he also like to fuck with you by pretending to do nice things or be nice just to pull the rug out from under you to “teach you a lesson” to trust people which has obviously led to me not being able to trust people having good intentions and suspect anterior motives in everyone.

But that’s not the thing, the thing which caught my attention some couple days back was- not a thing but a creature who’s gonna bring some other creatures in this balcony, I mean World. You got that- a Pregnant Pigeon, of course female. So everyday it had been routine for me to check her before going home and after coming here. Sometimes when I go at that seat I put some edible things which I am sure it has not even touched yet, coz I see those item still kept there. So now I has stopped putting extra item coz they will go waste, as Mother Pigeon hasn’t trusted me yet. Ah tough Mothers. So 1–2 days ago, since it has started rainy season here, Mother Pigeon got in some trouble. For my daily check up at it, I checked it and saw Mother Pigeon was soaking wet. But that’s not only thing which made my inner instincts googly but that my MOTHER PIGEON HAS REALLY BECOME MOTHER BY NOW!!! And was soaking wet, also notice. I went all googly, left my Maths class very fastly writing, went in Office and asked bhaiya for some cardboard and so. As it was raining heavily and I don’t trust myself with these emergency moments. I didn’t want to ruin all for her. Bhaiya said me to wait for a little. After a while he returned with two wooden pieces and I becoming anxious took duty on me. And started putting in guard. Till then Mother Pigeon flew away but still keeping an eye on me. Told you, trust issues with Mothers. I tried to put them in all different ways. All dangerous coz they might fall on Baby Pigeons. Also I was thinking Mother Pigeon now would not come to them as I read a story like this in my 9th class Hindi Book. Bhaiya instructed me to put an Advertisement Hoarding lying there. Indian Habitual elements such like also helpful sometimes. I thought this at that very moment. And shifted everything. And came back to my seat. And checking and praying for Mother Pigeon to come as I didn’t want New born Baby Pigeons to be abandoned coz of my stupidity. And guess what, Mother Pigeon didn’t flew away in while being in rain but still keeping an eye on me. Uff, these Mothers’ trust issues. Look, You can watch the water falling from roof through pipe (rain is unnoticeable in photo). But to my safe heart, Mother Pigeon returned to Baby Pigeons. Hihi, what a relief. But still checking surroundings after landing. Hshhh, These Mothers, WITH TRUST ISSUES. Look, But finally, Mother Pigeon met My baby Pigeons. OfcOuRsE my Pigeons, dude you owe me a good treat. I saved your newborn body from water. You were shivering like ewyuyuhu. Huhh, little ones. Haha. Here’s final picture of Family together. It’s not clear. Bye. To be honest, this didn’t make me happy. This just made me smiley for some of time being. I don’t know how these silly things make people happy for whole day. I do many things like this and forget them after a little time to be lost in my struggling or sad things. Final Bye."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

Their push to eradicate malaria and polio will give families tremendous strides toward getting out of poverty. When parents can’t work, due to disease, families suffer. Imagine all the hard work put into the Foundation and raising their children together, all the good times with family and friends- all thrown away because Bill couldn’t cut a sex trafficker loose. Melinda has said she asked Bill many times why Jeffery Epstein was so important to him, but never got a real answer. That is a kick to the gut right there.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"This was a story from the news many years ago and was even the basis for an episode of one of those lawyer-based TV shows. This guy finds out his wife is cheating after many years of marriage and three kids. He dumps her. Due to her cheating he gets full custody. You can guess where this is going. I’ll skip the details but during the course of lengthy divorce and battle, he comes to find out that none of the kids are his. We’re talking about a teen, a pre-teen, and the youngest maybe 7 or 8; and none of them knew the truth. He tried his best to continue being their dad but he just couldn’t do it. And the ex refused to reveal the identity of the father. Anyway he manages to get the kids moved back in with the ex. But the courts ruled he still had to pay child support on all three until they turned 18. In the old days he could have gotten out of it and maybe been able to sue her. But over time the courts have shifted toward doing whatever is best for the kids. In this case the thinking is that since he bonded with them as the father, he accepted that responsibility; paternity irrelevant. Laws vary from state to state but in many cases this paternal bond only takes as little as a few months to form. So gents, it just might be worth it to privately and quietly verify that you are indeed the real daddy as soon as the baby is born. I know it sounds drastic but 50% of marriages end in divorce. DNA tests are cheap and easy to do; and well worth it to alleviate any shred of doubt you have or may come to have over the years. FWIW"},{"instruction":"What is Bootstrap?

Let <2> = [math]2^2[/math], and generally <n> = [math]n^n[/math] Now let [2] = <<2>>, that is <4>, and [3] = <<<3>>>, that is <<27>>, that is [math]<27^{27}>[/math], and in general [n] = <..<n>..>, with n sets of <>. Now let (2) = [[2]], (3) = [[[3]]] and so on. But consider (2). That is [[2]], and we saw a moment ago that [2] was <4>, that turns out to be 256. We may think for a moment that [256] isn’t scary, but that turns into <..<256>..> with 256 sets of angle brackets. That is <..<[math]256^{256}[/math]>..> with 255 sets of angle brackets, and already the number is massively bigger than a Googol (a mere [math]10 ^{100}[/math]) so we are going to have to build a “tower of exponents” to even try to write this down. At the next level this is <..<[math]256^{256}^{256}^{256}[/math]>..> and there are still 254 iterations to go. So we end up trying to write a tower of exponents [math]2^{256}[/math] elements high, and even in this form the Universe itself isn’t large enough to contain it, never mind writing the number out longhand. (2) rejoices in the name of mega, not to be confused with the “mega-” prefix we generally use for large units and just meaning “million”. Instead we could begin with a bigger number than 2; (10) is called megiston, “biggest” (although of course you can easily conceive of a bigger one) and you’ll soon find that even getting as far as evaluating [10] leaves you with an unwieldy number, never mind [[[[[[[[[[10]]]]]]]]]]. But we’ll keep megiston in as part of our thought experiment. Okay, so now draw a number line one hundred million miles long, with zero at one end and infinity at the other.

Yes 5 Years is a long time and I am thankful to the almighty and the people around me who made it happen. I love memories as they wont change. I have all of my photographs from last eight years. I would post the first one from 2008 and then we will start from 2012 to 2016. This is me on the very first new year celebration night away from home. The picture itself says a lot, simple, sensible guy with poor dressing sense. Knew nothing about dressing sense, fashion. Was there at my college to pursue my dream. I didn’t even knew how to pose for a click I guess! This was clicked by one of my college friend i our Hostel. Two things from this picture which I love about me is ?? Any guesses ?? Yes my Hair :( and ?? Simplicity. 2012 Life was fun. I was on the top of the world. It was my first year of the post graduation. Used to go for trips, nearby site seeing, exams, college. Husshhhh I miss those days. The life here was so easy. Use to work at college, play, eat and sleep. Unaware of the responsibilities. This phase of life taught me about the importance of friends in our lives. Those are nothing but our extended family. We use to spend our days together. Those kamineys are awesome. This was one of the awesome phase of life. We didn’t had lots of money to spend but we had enough time for each other which we hardly have these days. Adding an extra picture of our group at college. We named it KAMINEY, :P 2013 This was the worst period of my life. I was looking for a job. I used to keep dreaming about a good job. The only thing on my mind was to get placed in one of the best companies as I always dreamt about. This phase taught me to handle life lightly/easily. During this period I got to know about my real friends and friends who are for namesake. My family never asked me about my efforts for getting a job but my distant relatives and family friends didn’t kept any question in their mind. These were the list of questions. What sort of job will you get? What would be the salary? My son works in US, Do you have any scope of going abroad? Get a job ASAP and get married. You are turning bald? Such questions and advises kept coming. I didn’t lost my cool. Enjoyed a lot with my family, had lots of photo shoots, chit chats with my mom. That was the best part along with mom made food which I always craved for when I was at hostel. I always answered them with a smile on my face, because somewhere I knew that its their topic for gossiping. They don’t even care for me. Why should I care about their questions? What this phase of life taught me? Patience. Yes I came back with a bang. 2014 Smiling with confidence Joined in one of the reputed pharma company that too in the department of my choice. Was the happiest man on the earth when I got the confirmation call. This phase too was full of challenges. I got a temporary job here, which was on a contract basis. I worked hard enough to convert the same to a permanent job, that too 6 months before the time. This phase taught me about managing life. I was in Hyderabad with a salary of 10K. I managed in that salary for 6 months and also learned practical skills to properly utilize money. I found it difficult to ask for any extra money from my family. But these awesome people kept showering their blessings along with the financial support whenever I went to see them. Family is always there in our good as well as bad time. 2015 Cool, Composed, Confident. Accomplished my goal, went on travelling to places. Life taught me enough. Enjoyed this phase, Worked hard. Fulfilled my dream of getting a good job. The smile says it all. Bought gifts for all my loved ones. Saw their beautiful faces glowing with happiness. That was the real pleasure. 2016 Shifted the gear, after making all of them happy it was the time to gift myself for the awesome job :P Gifted myself a brand new bike in the last week. Few months before gifted myself with a brand new mobile. My dream mobile. I phone. Awesome time with colleagues. I started reliving my college life. Getting prepared for the upcoming responsibilities now. Started giving time for my hobbies which includes writing. Compared to what I was in 2008, I have enough confidence to grow and life has made me mature enough to deal with most of the things. Thanks for stopping by!

An example is the use of the heavy guns (initially naval guns) in coastal batteries. Coastal battery in Belgium (WWI) Nevertheless, from a tactical perspective it is far better to have a purpose-build system (including fire control) and protection than simply copy-paste from another application. That is why this type of solution has always been a quick-fix until better solutions can be found. E.g. taking a turret of a battleship seems a straightforward thing, but many battleship turret systems extend several floors into the ship’s hull (typically to accommodate the reloading equipment/facilities.

In the 2019 LS elections, the Congress could improve its tally of 2014 by only 8 seats and failed to secure the leader of opposition slot in the Lok Sabha yet again. The end of 2019 was not bad electorally, though it is the allies of the grand old party which actually deserve credit.

When critiquing, you are reading for more than pleasure or to learn something. It goes well beyond pointing out typos and misspellings, although those are important to note. Your goal is to help the author find what’s missing or wrong with their work so they can improve. As you learn to do that, you will find that you are able to read your own work and find many of your own mistakes in the same way. For example, you are reading and following the story. The author suddenly switches to another character’s point of view, and it stopped you cold. The next time you’re reading your own work, you may realize you did the same thing. Because critiquing someone else’s work is a big responsibility, take it seriously. If you’re not sure of a word’s spelling or meaning, look it up. Lots of people write the wrong word when two sound alike but have different meanings. Are there too many run-on sentences, and you felt as if you had to rush to keep up? What made the work easy or difficult to read? Sometimes you won’t know exactly what’s wrong, but you can convey that you got stuck at point A, or had to go back and reread several paragraphs before you could move on, etc. Do critiquing well, and you will develop better skills in grammar, sentence structure, and overall flow or writing as a result. When you focus on detecting mistakes, recognizing that something is missing, or knowing when the pace (or cadence or rhythm) of the story isn’t flowing well, you’ll become a better writer. One part of critiquing, too, is the importance of acknowledging when something is written well, the scene they just described was terrific, or you enjoyed how they made you feel the characters joy or pain through they way they wrote it."},{"instruction":"What are the best freelancing sites?","output":"Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer, Toptal, and Guru."},{"instruction":"Do the pheromones plugins really relieve a cat’s stress?

The entire point of a wind turbine is that it generates electricity by capturing some of the energy from the wind, no ‘fuel’ needed. But perhaps you've heard of more specialized applications, where wind turbines are used in remote locations not on the main grid. In those locations, when the wind's not blowing, the turbines aren't generating electricity. And large scale energy storage still isn't very mature, so they can’t just store excess electricity to use later. So, a lot of remote locations will use wind diesel systems. Set up a few wind turbines to generate the bulk of the electricity, and then turn on the diesel generators when the wind's not blowing. Here's an example of one such system: [LINKED_TEXT: Hybrid wind-diesel plant meets Batan Island's total power needsThe Philippines inaugurated its first hybrid wind-diesel power plant in December. The installation, on Batan Island in the country's central Batanes province, comprises three 60 kW turbines from the French small turbine manufacturer Vergnet, and two 500 kW diesel generators. The wind turbines meet the island's total power needs from late afternoon to early morning, when the winds are at their strongest, after which the generators take over. The system is designed so that additional turbines can be added as demand increases. This is the first time Batan has had round the clock power. First Philippine Energy Corp developed the project in collaboration with Advanced Energy Systems of Australia on behalf of state-owned National Power Corps (Napocor), which also operates the plant. Napocor expects to save around PHP 2.5 million (EUR 34,000) a year in fuel costs. Energy Secretary Vincent S Perez said at the inauguration ceremony that the project was \\"a strong showcase of the government's commitment to renewable energy\\" and hoped it would be replicated elsewhere in the Philippines. \\"Amid the rising cost of fossil fuels,\\" he continued, \\"it signals the beginning of our independence from imported oil.\\" Vergnet says there is strong interest from public and private organizations to implement additional wind energy projects.https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/962025/hybrid-wind-diesel-plant-meets-batan-islands-total-power-needs] [URL: https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/962025/hybrid-wind-diesel-plant-meets-batan-islands-total-power-needs]Previously, a lot of these communities relied solely on diesel generators. The wind turbines help save them a lot on the cost of electricity by greatly reducing the amount of diesel fuel they need to import – more than enough to be worth the cost of installation. And from a tree hugger perspective, it helps reduce carbon emissions. On larger grids, the shear number of power plants helps make up for the shortfall when the wind's not blowing at any one wind farm. But even then, there are other sources besides wind like hydro, natural gas, and coal that can be ramped up when needed."},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"If you are vegetarian, hitting the gym and want to build muscle and be healthy and fit, then you should consider adding the following food items in your diet- Peanut ButterGreen gram (Moong Beans)Bengal gram (kala chana/black chana)Health mix (search on Flipkart/Amazon)BananaPomegranateDatesAlmondsCashewsWalnutsOatsPaneerSoya chunks (Read about ideal daily quantity first)Green veggies (overall very important)Sweet PotatoesSeeds (Sunflower/Hemp/Pumpkin)Skimmed milk powder (Amul Sagar would be my recommendation) Some important tips: We are not what we eat but what we digest.

They can tolerate colder temperatures, so they can be planted in the fall and will bloom until late spring.Provide proper watering: Pansies need consistently moist soil, but be careful not to over-water as this can lead to root rot.Fertilize: Pansies benefit from regular fertilization, use a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks.Deadhead: Deadheading, or removing spent blooms, will encourage the plant to produce more flowers.Provide support: Pansies have a tendency to become top-heavy with blooms, so they may need support to keep them from falling over.Keep them clean: Regularly check the leaves and remove any yellow or diseased leaves, this will help the plant to focus on blooming.Provide adequate spacing: Pansies need space to grow and bloom, so make sure to plant"},{"instruction":"[math]x^2 + y^2 + 1 = z^2[/math]","output":"Expression evaluates to [math]4xyz[/math] if [math]x=y=z[/math] or [math]xyz = 0.[/math] Considering [math]x,y,z neq 0[/math] , divide the expression by [math]4xyz.[/math] [math]therefore dfrac{(1-y^{2})(1-z^{2})}{2ycdot2z} + dfrac{(1-z^{2})(1-x^{2})}{2zcdot2x} + dfrac{(1-x^{2})(1-y^{2})}{2xcdot2y} = 1.[/math] Substitute [math]x = tan(alpha)[/math] , [math]y = tan(beta)[/math] and [math]z = tan(gamma)[/math], where [math]alpha,beta,gamma[/math] are the angles of a triangle.

How?","output":"Yes and no. Both techniques have their pros and cons, and for some situations NMR is the better option, for others X-ray crystallography. I’ll break them down into a list so it’s easier to understand. NMR: Pros: In a liquid form; thus mimicking bodily conditions (many use phosphate buffer and a pH of 7 to get as close to body conditions as possible). Or in other words “native” conditions of the macromolecule You can observe multiple conformations, and can even determine what ratio a protein flips between one conformation to another. Non-destructive technique. This same sample can then be used for a variety of other analysis/tests. Dynamic analysis. You can observe allosteric interactions, observe protein-protein interactions, and even folding. Real time experiments. A combination of all the above allows you to observe actual reactions happening in real time at a molecular level. Cons: Size limitation. This is the main drawback for NMR. If your protein is too big, you can’t analyze it via NMR. There are stronger magnets that are coming out, and better labeling schemes coming out that allow you to use NMR on bigger proteins. But most protein complexes are still too big for NMR. Solubility in regards to the concentration required. NMR requires a concentrated sample for decent resolution. Many proteins simply aren’t soluble at those concentrations, or tend to dimerize at those higher concentrations. Either of which is bad for NMR. Price. NMR is incredibly expensive to maintain. Crystallography: Pros No size limit. You want a massive transmembrane protein with 10 domains, go ahead. Resolution is as good as NMR Cons: Solid structure. This is not a good representation of native conditions. Your protein will never be in a solid crystallized structure in your body. Due to the above, you’ll usually only be able to see one conformation. Proteins have multiple conformations, and some of those conformations might be crucial to their interactions/reaction with other proteins or small molecules. You cannot observe this with crystallography. Destructive. Your sample is gone once it’s crystallized. Got the crystal structure? Good, can’t use it for anything else. Difficult. It is very difficult and time consuming to crystallize proteins. While NMR has solubility issues, those are a lot easier resolved than attempting to crystallize a protein. Resolution: If your protein is small enough and solubilizes well at the concentrations required for good resolution data, then NMR is the way to go. If your protein is too big for NMR, then there are other methods (i.e. cryo-EM, SAXS, X-ray Crystallography, even IR). So to answer your question personally: I don’t like the term superior, since that implies one technique is better than the other. Both are valid techniques used for structural analysis, and both provide atomic resolution data."},{"instruction":"Social Science","output":"Long ago I concluded social science is a jobs program for digits.

Anyone working in the arms industry would be the last to be sent to the frontlines. How else are you going to make your guns? University students are also generally exempt, at least until they’ve completed their studies. This is doubly so for those whose skills are going to be valuable to the war effort, like engineers and doctors. “Intellectuals”, stereotypically professors, are often way too old to be fighting anyway. Nobody in a rifle platoon wants to babysit a 50 year-old scientist who never held a gun before. Even if they are enlisted, somehow, they will always end up in non-combat positions like logistics, engineering, medical corps, propaganda, intelligence, or cryptography (and today, possibly cybersecurity). Their war will be fought in front of a computer and behind a desk even if they were, theoretically, fit enough to serve in the frontlines. The only way they get sent to the front is if they volunteer. Some did, some were comfortable where they were. Forcing any of them to hold a rifle and man the post is a waste of valuable resources. There are so many potential riflemen and very few computer specialists in a country. When the war ends, these people won’t take very long to adjust to the new peacetime economy; their skills can be put to use just as well with different subjects.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"I couldn’t entirely tell you what my IQ is, but from the various tests I’ve taken, I know I’m at least in the 150+ range. Here it goes, I’ve literally never had to try — not in grade school, not in college. I never felt challenged. Growing up, this was a big disadvantage because the teachers would give the class work, but I’d finish it too quickly and then I’d just pester other people for entertainment. Needless to say, I got in LOTS of trouble at school. As I grew, this never-ending thirst for information lead to me women, conflicts a-plenty, and one whole bunch of fun. Going on to high school though gave me a different battle. I literally ran out of information. I became immensely interested in history and writing. I would watch hours and hours of documentaries, and I would read the hell out of biographies and practically anything I could get my hands on. Typical literature though bored me. If I could use the literature as a means of analyzing the author’s thoughts, I’d enjoy that, but that never really took more than a five minute glance at the book’s contents to figure out… especially with modern writing. Because of this eventual ‘end of information,’ my latter years in high school scared me. I started becoming disconnected from reality. Life felt like it had no substance. The conversations of my peers had no meaning. I often found myself in ‘auto-pilot’ as I went throughout my day. I would go in and out of five to ten minute lapses of consciousness — my stare fixed straight ahead. Despite not experiencing a thing, I still aced my tests, and even the word study never so much as glanced past my vocabulary. I graduated, and I didn’t even attend my ceremony. It seemed like a waste of time because I truly felt that no effort was dispensed. It was like I was incubating. Afterwards, I briefly entered the workforce and then I enrolled in college. While working, I had an EXTREMELY solitary job. There was not a single soul to interact with. I worked in the oilfield, 12 hour night shifts in the middle of nowhere, and I lived in a trailer with one stranger who worked the day shift for 12 hours. We rarely ever spoke to each other, and the vast majority of my job involved waiting. I still contemplate whether or not the job was healthy for me, but it had its quirks. I decided to keep a journal of literally EVERY thought that crossed my mind. There was no phone reception and my only source of electricity was the cigarette lighter in my truck, so the end result lead to me spending probably 11 hours a night just recording my thoughts for three months. I learned about myself, and judged my future, and recorded my successes, compared lives with others, and everything in between. I stared at the huge gas-flare lighting up my surroundings and I pondered all the physics and geography that has to do with oil drilling. I was always fascinated by physics, but my time in the oilfield gave me a fixation with geography as well. Though I still felt disconnected, this was the ‘self’ I took to college. Having new information finally grounded me back to earth. I had to learn a new rhythm. High school was easy, but I knew college only seemed hard — there was a method to the madness. I definitely tried the hardest I ever tried in the first semester of college, and needless to say, I made A’s in everything. Christmas break came around and I felt disconnected again, but then school came rushing back in and everything was okay for a bit. By this time, I was back to my old high school self. I put forward no effort and excelled in classes. That became a problem. Higher education was like a drug. I took my first hit and it sated my thirst for knowledge a bit, but the second time around, its effectiveness plummeted. I needed something else. It was at this time that I started pursuing different, more romantic, goals in life. Up until my fall freshman year in college (age 18) I never bothered getting romantically involved with women. I literally never cared. I found myself more than content watching porn, beating it to help me sleep, and then going about my everyday life. Perhaps it was just a numbers game. My graduating class only had 26 kids, so the dating pool was already small, and in was infinitesimally smaller given that I only found one other woman even remotely date-able, but even she was in a long-term relationship that she wasn’t going to leave for another 3 years after graduating. My dating experience went fast and in a blaze of glory. I probably talked to a total of ten women, kissed five, had sex with three, and then married one — all in the course of only a couple of years from beginning the whole deal. As a relatively smart person, I found dating to be very interesting. It was almost like a puzzle to me… it still is with my wife. To this day, I’ve probably figured out more emotional problems with women than at least a few psychologists. In a way, I guess, I turned to women as my new source of information. I got to know them, played around in bed with them, learned their bodies, learned their minds, and then I connected it all together. It was the first time in which I really experienced my emotional self, and up until this point, I don’t think I’d ever tapped into it before. Even to the most strong willed person I meet, I’ll still tell them to this day — you never know what you’ll do when you’re in love. I found myself doing some incredibly stupid shit, and I can guarantee that you will too. Don’t ever doubt it. My college work after I started dating became far more efficient too. It was a mixture of me having absolutely no money and not seeing it as a necessity, but I started taking my classes without even buying the books. I depended entirely on the lectures, and then took the tests. At first I kept a few notebooks and wrote down key topics, but after a few months, even that stopped. I remember one girl I was involved with at the time, Maegan. Maegan and I took an upper level history class together with a professor who graduated from Yale, wrote well over ten books, and gave the BEST lectures ever. I would stroll into her classroom with a paper plate with two pepperoni pizzas on it that I got for free from whatever seminar happened on the campus that day, and I would just listen to the professor as if she was an episode of Scooby-Doo or some other cartoon. From onlookers, I paid a child-like attention. Before she met me, Maegan thought for sure that I was bombing the hell out of that class. After our first few conversations, Dr. Hinton’s class came up, and she suddenly recognized me. I was ‘that guy who didn’t pay attention and just sat there rudely eating pizza while I [Maegan] was diligently taking notes.’ For one, I didn’t even remember what the hell time she was talking about because my days more or less ran together by this point, and for two, I really thought nothing of it. This was the first time someone gave me a true ‘outside the window, looking-in’ view of how I acted in the classroom and how particular it was. She asked how I could ever do that. Flabbergasted, she said ‘but she has so much information in her lectures! Do you just remember all of that?’ Flabbergasted as she was, not much compared to her reaction after I told her that I don’t even use, or buy, the books. For the most part, college stayed this way, but every now and then, I had a bone to pick with the professors. I’ve always been real keen on a bullshitter when I see one. If someone’s just stringing me along, I’m quick to realize it, and I have two steps to that — the same two steps I have with my entire life. Fool me once, and it’s on you to fix the problem. Fool me twice, and I’ll fix the problem, and neither you or I will probably like the outcome. I’ve always stood up to people who messed with either me or the few close friends I had, and as an educator (which was what I went to college for), I got real fuckin’ pissed if a teacher created a system in which it graded kids on an uneven scale. It almost sounds hilarious, but I ended up taking a ‘Literary Fairy Tales’ class over the summer. The class sounded like a good place to meet girls, and in fact, I knew for sure of a girl that interested me who was in that class. I soon found out though that the Disney character of a professor that I was expecting to see was an awful person who was hell bent on convincing all her students that all fairy tales were secret feminist cries for help, and if you didn’t think that way it meant your grade. Oh, and did I mention that if you missed ONE day of class, you dropped an ENTIRE LETTER GRADE??? Classes are supposed to gauge the amount of information one knows about the topic. If I write a proper paper that has its facts and reasoning all in a pretty little line and you can’t find any faults in it, that’s called an A. If I already know your bullshit spiel and and I ace your papers, don’t be magically offended when I’m not motivated enough to hear you blow your regurgitated story out of your ass on yet another ‘literary fairy tale.’ I called her out in class twenty-four seven. I challenged her logic, and I left her without a comeback everytime, and she kept lowering my grades on my papers again and again. I finally had enough of it and I told her off for good. I told her that she was more concerned with teaching her students what to think instead of presenting them with the facts and actually allowing them to think, and not only did she not do this, but that she reinforced it by having a ridiculous borderline-Nazi styled attendance policy that was only compounded by the fact that she docked off points for not thinking like her. I told her that ultimately we, as the students, were responsible for her paycheck and that she’d better have some damned respect for her pupils if she ever wants to have any degree of success with less-than-brainwashed kids. This bitch actually tried laughing this off. She denied the fact that the students are responsible for her paycheck via tuition. I looked at her and said “how about you go teach your fairy tales to the four walls of an empty room and see how much you get paid. Oh, and by the way, I’m going to be a teacher, and I’m going to make damn sure that the next thousand kids I come in contact with know how shitty of a human being you are” She started threatening me and telling me to leave the classroom, so I did. I was finished with what I had to say anyhow. I later learned that despite all the tough talk she gave me, she immediately ran to the dean in a tattle-tale-like fashion just so she could get her story in first to save her job. She knew she was in the wrong and she still has her job, but man it feels fuckin’ amazing to know you’re in the right and put that stain on their memories like that. Sometimes I feel like teachers like that don’t get the cue that some kids know exactly what they’re doing. I’ve even done that to a lot of bosses, which brings me to my employment. Getting a job and keeping a job has always been hard for me. I get bored far too quickly, and though I’ve written a practical essay at this point and I could go on much further, I wind this down to an end. tl;dr Advantages, In the realm of information processing, you don’t have to try. School is easy. You get to understand much more than the average person due to the ability to critically think. Disadvantages, Because school is so easy, you tend to have a pretty shitty work ethic (if it’s not challenging, you drop it quickly) Because you understand much more than the average person, living in the world can be very frustrating, especially since few people are capable of bouncing back your ideas which can sometimes be necessary for you to vent frustrations.

Recent years, due to the increasing trend towards Natural Botany Solutions, Western societies have only been made aware of its impressive medicinal benefits. The anti-hyperglycemic potential of Berberine has been confirmed by multiple human studies. This highlights the ability of Berberine to support blood sugar and cholesterol levels. The growing numbers of research papers published in various prestigious journals, including the Journal of Metabolism , evaluated and confirmed the anti-diabetic potential of Berberine. (To read the full studies, follow the links at the bottom of this page.) 5 Specific Ways Berberine Can Stabilize Your Blood Sugar Berberine has been prized for centuries for its healing properties. Now this potent herb is naturally balancing blood sugar levels by helping your body: Decrease insulin resistance, making the blood sugar lowering hormone ‘insulin’ more effective Berberine may activate the ‘metabolic master switch’: An energy-stabilizing enzyme found inside cells, AMPK (adenosine monophosphate kinase), is known as a ‘metabolic master switch’ due to its positive influence on metabolism.[*] It’s believed that this helps improve insulin sensitivity at the cellular level. Decrease sugar production in the liver Berberine helps slow the sugar factory: According to studies, berberine may stimulate glycolysis, the metabolic pathway by which sugar is broken down and converted to energy, and may inhibit gluconeogenesis, the creation of glucose.[*] In effect, these activities decrease insulin sensitivity and help to balance blood sugar levels. Slow the breakdown of carbohydrates Berberine supports the liver: Plant compounds are thought to help improve insulin sensitivity in the liver by reducing its production of glucose. Additionally, berberine is thought to boost thermogenesis. These activities help suppress the liver’s tendency to make new glucose when liver cells become insulin resistant. Increases the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. ¹ Several studies have shown that berberine may modulate the gut microbiota through enriching short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and reducing microbial diversity. This in turn inhibits dietary polysaccharide degradation and decreases caloric intake in the gut, which may improve energy metabolism and intestinal health; anti-inflammatory effects; and immune regulatory effects. Removes deep body fat that accumulates around the belly and organs There’s a strong correlation between blood sugar and weight loss. Research on berberine for weight loss and fat-burning activity is limited but promising. In one 12-week study, subjects lost about 2.3% body weight — or 5 pounds — and lowered BMI and body fat percentage by 3.6% with a dosage of 3,500 mg per day.[*] Another 3-month study revealed a drop in BMI, from 31.5 to 27.4, in obese indivhttps://www.digistore24.com/redir/352613/ghuffran/] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/352613/ghuffran/]"},{"instruction":"ve you left California and if so, why?","output":"For 5 years to New Mexico.

Lots of people will want to make this about “not if you have good technique,” but technique is only a small piece of it, and rest is important for all voices. Put another way: if you were running a marathon every day of your life, would that be bad for you? Sure, if you had bad running technique you’d be even more prone to injury, but even if with perfect technique, 26 miles takes a huge strain on your body. There’s an amount of running, say a few miles a day, that’s not just not-bad, but actively good for you, but there’s also a limit. The same is true for speaking, but there are many professions for which that limit is not observed in the lifestyle. If you’re talking all day long, you will probably develop injuries at some point. This is part of why school teachers famously develop vocal trauma: they have no choice but to speak all day (and sometimes yell), which is very, very hard on the voice regardless of technique."},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"“ Arjun, please tell your mother not to make changes to anything in the house!

This upset Seema even more, and she rushed into the bedroom, like a train whizzing past a station without stopping. Arjun knew he was in trouble, so he delayed going to the bedroom, instead hanging out in the hall until the time he thought she would cool down. Just as he was about to start working on something, his mother stormed into the house,” You wife is so cruel! I kept the flower vase on top of the cupboard instead of the table, so that it doesn’t break, I changed the position of the TV, because it was awkward, I changed the place of your lazy buoy chair. She changed all of those to their original position, and started banging things while she was doing those, how insensitive!” saying that, his mother chugged on into her room. Now Arjun was angry at Seema, so he rushed to his bedroom and saw Seema crying, face down on the bed. “You know, you shouldn’t have undone what mom had taken pains to correct” he said. Seema looked up momentarily, in disgust, and said “You’ll never understand, isn’t it? It’s always the wife’s fault.” and returned back to crying on the bed. Arjun tried to reason what Seema had just said, and reflected on his mother’s words. All the things his mother talked about, the vase, the TV, the chair, were placed by him, and he had told once to Seema that he liked the chair in that position, he liked the TV in that awkward position, even though Seems tried to correct it, and he had placed the vase in the vulnerable position, because he just liked it there.

But if repairs are not your forte’, or you absolutely hate that kind of work, I’d suggest you hire the man. While you save money by doing it yourself, you save time and sanity by having a contractor do it. And if you develop a good relationship with a certain contractor, you can often work out discounts.

Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‘bouncy’ than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for.

The place was Orpington, a fairly nondescript suburb on the edge of South East London, which just happens to be where I grew up. The restaurant was McDonalds, newly opened as a chain in the UK, and certainly not what we had been used to on the British High Street. The customer was Elsie. Now, no-one really knew how old Elsie was. At the time, she was probably in her 70s, but she might have been in 60s or 80s. Elsie had the bad luck to be born, with a cleft palatte, in an era where the country’s response to such children was to separate them from “normal people.” By time the events of this answer took place, she was well-established in what would now be called a “care home” in a village in rural area a few miles outside of Orpington. It was clear that she’d never had any formal education, at least she couldn’t read or write, and not obviously do any maths. In fact, she couldn’t really string much of a sentence together. Mostly three or four words was her limit. She did, however, have a strong sense of what she wanted, and the kind of willpower you could break rocks on. She managed to regularly get people to drive her into Orpington. I’m not just talking about care home workers, but people from local churches, teenagers from the village who’d got their first cars… you name it, people knew her, and did what she asked. In the case of McDonalds, her entire order was “cup of tea.” The first times this happened, there was a bit of confusion. Attempts were made to explain that McDonalds, despite expanding into England, didn’t serve cups of tea. Her reply was the phrase “cup of tea.” Further attempts were made to advise her that this wasn’t on the menu. “Cup of tea”, was her considered response. Finally, one of the staff worked out what was needed. (S)he (local legend didn’t relate the gender of the person in question) went up to the staff room, got some cash, walked out of McDonalds, into a local Pizza restaurant, bought a cup of tea, and brought it back to McDonalds for Elsie. Elsie now had proof that her strategy worked. For the next five years, she was a regular in Orpington McDonalds, accustomed to getting her cup of tea. After the first couple of months, the service speed increased, since whoever was on the tills would inevitably recognise her before she made her way to the counter, and someone would be en route to the restaurant a few doors down the high street to make the purchase. As far as I know, McDonalds officially never knew of this. It just became the norm for the minimum-wage staff to go and buy this elderly lady her unvarying beverage of choice."},{"instruction":"here been an increase in UFO activity since the Voyager satellite left our solar system?","output":"In addition to [LINKED_TEXT: Viktor T.

But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally.

Rather, the forex is an electronic organization of banks, financiers, institutional financial backers, and individual merchants (generally exchanging through businesses or banks). KEY TAKEAWAYS The forex is a worldwide commercial center for trading public monetary standards.Unfamiliar trade scenes contain the biggest protections market on the planet by ostensible worth, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day.Unfamiliar trade exchanging utilizes cash matches, evaluated as far as one versus the other.Advances and fates are one more method for partaking in the forex market. Money Pairs In forex exchanging, monetary forms are recorded two by two, like USD/CAD, EUR/USD, or USD/JPY. These address the U.S. dollar (USD) versus the Canadian dollar (CAD), the euro (EUR) versus the USD, and the USD versus the Japanese yen (JPY). There will likewise be a cost related with each pair, for example, 1.2569. Assuming this is the USD/CAD pair, it implies that it costs 1.2569 CAD to get one USD. On the off chance that the cost increments to 1.3336, it currently costs 1.3336 CAD to get one USD. The USD has expanded in esteem against the CAD, so it presently costs more CAD to get one USD.

All things considered, unfamiliar trade market support was for legislatures, enormous organizations, and mutual funds. In this day and age, exchanging monetary standards is however simple as a tick of a mouse and openness seems to be not an issue. Numerous speculation organizations permit people to open records and exchange monetary forms through their foundation. This isn't similar to an excursion to an unfamiliar trade booth. The cycle is altogether electronic with no actual trade of cash starting with one hand then onto the next. Rather, dealers are taking a situation in a particular money with the expectation that there will be some vertical development and strength in the cash that they're purchasing (or shortcoming in the event that they're selling) so they can create a gain. Forex Market versus Different Markets There are a few crucial contrasts between unfamiliar trade and different business sectors. There, first of all, are less guidelines, and that implies financial backers aren't held to severe principles or guidelines like those in the stock, fates, and choices markets. There are no clearing houses and no focal bodies that direct the forex market. Second, since exchanges don't occur on a conventional trade, there are less charges or commissions like those on different business sectors. Then, there's no end with regards to when you can and can't exchange. Since the market is open 24 hours every day, you can exchange whenever. At last, since it's a particularly fluid market, you can get in and out at whatever point you need and you can purchase however much cash that you can bear."},{"instruction":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","output":"This goes back to English common law and the English Bill of Rights, now only a shadow of its former self.

Not terribly long after their civil war came the Glorious Revolution and the right of all Englishmen to be armed “suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by law.” The modifiers, of course, were stretched to the point that in April 1775 the military governor of Massachusetts, Thomas Gage, felt perfectly justified in ordering the confiscation of guns, ball and powder from the local citizenry. This was resisted in the Battles of Concord and Lexington, the first military actions of the Revolutionary War. In some states, there’s a Patriots’ Day holiday, and the Boston Marathon is run then.

They had engaged in a series of skirmishes on the way, and followed the Americans, who had attacked them, to the margin of the Assanpink. After trying to pass the guarded fords of that stream, they halted and lighted fires; and Cornwallis rested that night with the full assurance that he would make an easy conquest of the republican army the next day. \\"I will catch the fox in the morning,\\" he said the Earl to Sir William Erskine, who urged him to make an attack that night. Washington's army were now in a very critical situation. A council of war was held, when it was decided to withdraw stealthily, at midnight, take a circuitous route to Princeton, gain the rear of the British and beat up their quarters there, and then fall upon their stores at New Brunswick. But the ground, on account of a thaw, was too soft to allow an easy transit for their forty pieces of cannon. This gave Washington much anxiety. While the council was in session, the wind turned to the northwest, the temperature suddenly fell, and by midnight the ground was frozen as hard as a pavement. Along the front of the American camp, fires had been lighted, and the British supposed the republicans were slumbering. Great was their surprise, multiplication and alarm, when, at dawn, they discovered that the American camp-fires were still burning but the army had departed, none knew whither. All was silent and dreary on the south side of the Assanpink, when suddenly there came upon the keen wintry air, from the direction of Princeton, the low booming of cannon. Although it was a cold winter's morning, Cornwallis thought the sound was the rumbling of distant thunder. The quicker of all, Erskine, decided that it was the noise of artillery, and exclaimed: \\"To arms, general! Washington has outgeneralled us.

Leaving hiss camp-fires burning, he left a small part of his force visibly guarding the camp (as if the main force had left), but moved the bulk of his army up the hill opposite the lake. As planned, his forces were hidden by the thick morning mist. The Romans took the bait.

The EU say Novavax is dragging it’s heels. Novavax say they are wary, following the AZ vaccine program. Who is telling the truth?","output":"I have replied to a Similar question before but now to try and put it from the view of a vaccine supplier : Supply contracts are complicated to negotiate and rely on good faith on both sides. If we take the Oxford/ AstraZeneca interaction between the U.K. and the EU. They were negotiated under different legal systems. The U.K. can work under a memorandum of understanding which declares an intent on a future transaction snd often happens in large contracts to allow the work to continue ahead of a formal sign off which is at the end of negotiations. Apparently the Belgium law that the EU used in its contract does not recognise this method of working. In the U.K. the government facilitated the development of plant by increasing capacity and paying upfront for the factory upgrade and some vaccine doses, the firms subcontracted by AstraZeneca to fulfil the contract failed to meet the agreed delivery request, but as the vaccine also experienced delays there was no come back by the U.K. government. The teething troubles in setting up the plants were resolved and when the U.K. did finally approve the vaccine for use while pushing for greater qualities , as one might expect in a pandemic the variability of batches was accepted as something that happened, an annoyance, but something that could be worked on in partnership. In the case of the EU they negotiated on the ‘at cost ‘ price to get a better deal, they expected production to be carried out in the EU, but allowed the U.K. plant to be included as authorised facilities; they paid on signing of the contract which payment went into building/ enhancing existing EU facilities that AstraZeneca subcontracted to carry out the work. They expected first class service while paying super economy pricing and a full servicing of their demands. After the contract was signed, and before the EU had approved the vaccine AstraZeneca informed them that the plants were not producing the expected yields and they would be unable to meet the first quarters expected deluvery quantity. Rather than trying to resolve the issue or to go to law the EU commission escalated to include a third party country was was distributing vaccine to its population as it had approved the vaccine some weeks previously. They demanded that this other country reduce its production of vaccine by diverting supplies to the EU, who at this time had still not approved the vaccine so could not have used it with their member states. Contract details that are normally confidential were published with parts redacted , which was easily circumvented and placed on the internet. While the EMA supported the decision to approve the vaccine, individual states decided to persue their own path at this point and applied their own restrictions , and there followed a campaign of sending the companies integrity and reputation, the EU even instigated dawn raids , the factory in Belgium was raised and no action was taken, rather fill and finish plant in Italy was raided and 250,000 doses destined for Australia which under new regulation the EU had just implemented was not a sanctioned export. So Australia was denied their supply by the EU. A few days ago the same plant was raided again, and some 30 million doses , or equivalent were found. For those who are unfamiliar with the term fill and finish it refers to the plant that takes the bulk vaccine batch, and transferred it rmto the vials for distribution and then labels and packages the vials for distribution to its intended destination. A production batch can be 1–2 million doses. U.K. the midst of a pandemic this plant would be working to capacity so a large amount of vaccine is to be expected. The initial rumour was that this was an undeclared stock heading towards the U.K. investigations showed that 16 million doses were destined for Belgium and the rest was a shipment destined for developing nations under the COVAX agreement. Both deliveries were allowed under the new EU regulations. Those in the EU will provide a different story of irregular deliveries and less than promised number of doses. The Politicians in the EU member states have politicised the vaccine to their own ends and stoked the already significant anti vaccine movement in the EU. And they have painted AstraZeneca as the villain of the piece. the EU has probably learned from its mistakes and will have updated their contract to avoid the issues they have experienced with the AstraZeneca contract, so the trend from the EU’s point of view will be one that will favour them at every point. From the Point of view of Novavax, they are dealing with a bloc of countries that at some points negotiate as a unit and at others each country will break away putting their own interests first. The contract will probably lock down delivery volumes and dates while offering novavax the ‘privilege’ of taking all the risk and carry the full burden of the costs if anything goes awry They have a good order book with countries that just want to be vaccinated. They will have to weigh up the options provided in the contract agains the risks they are going to take. They are aware of the treatment meted out to AstraZeneca, whether deserved or not. They have to decide if the profit is worth the potential pain the EU could inflict on them. They are probably weighting up their options and negotiating with their lawyer paying particular care to each clause in the contract. if they wish the U.K. has already offered to build managed plant for them, before their vaccine has even been agreed. In the U.K. they will be close to high quality research centres and there a major centre of genomic sequencing so they can gain from early access to new variants if they wanted the information. these are my readings of the situation, they could of course be wide of the mark.

Hakeem was the most dominate big man coming out of college at the time. Houston made the right choice in picking Hakeem. They would go on and win two titles with him, however the mistake was by the Portland Trailblazer in picking Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan. It made sense because they just drafted another guy that played in Jordan’s position in Clyde Drexler, Hakeem’s college teammate in the Phi Slama Jama Houston team. Also Bowie had so much potential coming out of college as a big man. Michael was a tramendous basketball player coming out, however nobody knew he would be the player that he would become because Dean Smith limited his play style while at North Carolina.

Things you should be aware of while hiring a mover For an expert packer and mover, the staff’s attitude and their job ethics decide the overall performance and infrastructure. If the shifting service provider fails to attract you with its attitude of expertise, you can determine that the packer is not the apt one to select for your moving requirement.When looking for reliable packers and movers, it is important to ensure the registration details and their license documents. This act confirms that the moving service provider has a trustable team of good resources to provide all the needed help for home shifting services.Always it is not true, but in most cases, a reliable shifting company will have its place for official duties rather than hiring a rented place. Also, if it is a rented office area, that does not mean it is a fake mover and packer. However, owning an office space almost confirms the moving company would be genuine.Before selecting any packer and mover, it is necessary to read reviews from the reliable sources of those relocation companies like doing market research and verifying neutral websites. Get references from your friends or relatives who have already experienced the services of those companies.When you are looking for shifting companies, it is apparent that we would look for the top moving company.

For example, the value of screen digits (that can be deleted) or bills (that can be burned) does not exist objectively in the way oxygen or the recurrent presence of the occipital lobe at the back of the average living skull, do. Politics as political science and economics as a social science are mostly not real science because what Thomas Kuhn called the “theoretical assumptions” are too changeable by culture to be considered objective enough for science. Rights and capitalism were made-up (during the 1700s) and caught on; they were not discovered like ordinary science but made up and (often implicitly) agreed upon. But then there are some very generalisable theories like Game Theory that come closer to more objectivity (the ideal of science), because they can be applied again and again. Considering the subject and observer relationship in anthropology is very interesting. The reason for a community that does Rain Dance is to the dancers their belief it could well bring rain - it is a false belief that is the explanation of the cause: that their moves could affect precipitation. The real cause, in anthropology called the functionalist explanation, is that the rain dance provides social cohesion in times of drought and distress. But ‘social cohesion’ is again not very objective because it does not explain why, in a comprehensive enough way, there is a need for social cohesion that plays out in that way, when it could play out another way, say by leaving for wetter land. Nor does it explain who came up with rain dancing, and why? But because it is the best explanation available it earns the social science title. The danger is that people trust in the generalising of social sciences as much as natural sciences just because they share ‘science’ in their titles. Mix X of hydrochloric acid with Y sodium chloride you will get Z sodium chloride and water. Mix X a female observer with Y a male in different coloured shirts you will get Z a very vague, changeable and insignificant enough data-set for ranking responses, making sense of them then applying the relations of colour and apparent biological sex to the rest of the populations. More of X (female) and more of Y (males in different shirts) and more recorded responses can increase probability of a very generalisable conclusion for how females respond to males in different shirt colours, but never totally. You can dress it up in percentages made up of recording many responses from say, “from 1–10 how do you like this colour on this male, 0 being awful, 10 stunning?”, but to those unversed in the different sciences, this can be misleading ‘dressing up’ of the qualitative as quantitative substance. “80% of females prefer green on a male”: 80% how? Which females and males? What criteria? What colour hue? Creating valid meta-analyses for that is implausible, perhaps impossible. Social sciences can not predict as much natural but does have some predictive principles (rather than laws) like Pavlov effect or the acquisition of language. In more material neuroscience there is Hebb's law. In the real world there is too much interference and variability going on per the Duhem-Quine problem. And social science more than other science suffers from ethical limits. In the prior shirt example the answers depend too much on the subjectivity of the male and the female - to ever make it a law, or even a substantially corroborated theory e.g. “green is preferred on males compared to beige”. Intuitively that clain is probably correct for the majority (green occurs more than beige and that is inferably for a reason), but it is unsubstantiated therefore failed science. The method resembles science, but there is no over-arching explanation that would make it rigorous science. It does not answer this is the nature of judgements of colour and opposite sex wearer; but that this is maybe the relationship of this for an extrapolated majority. As philosopher of science Carl Hempel argued science is essentially arguments with premises and conclusions, with ultimate laws and particular facts. For example, a hypothetical plant dies: “Because there are no windows in its room this plant has not get enough sunlight. Without enough sunlight a plant cannot create carbohydrates through photosynthesis, so will eventually die. Hence the plant died.” In this case two true laws and a particular fact are present. The law 1. that the plant needs light to photosynthesise and 2. the plant need photosynthesis to survive and the particular fact 3. that the plant was not exposed to sunlight. The most trusted - because reliable and consistent - science is of this kind. A lot of what passes for science in social science is not of this kind, therefore, is less trustworthy science than the physical but is the the best we have going for us. Social sciences has a difficult job to because of the limits and lack of generalising in ‘human nature'. But what alternative to probabilistic behavioural science is there? None that I know, and better to generalise and have probable (a spectrum of often mistaken to sometimes mistaken) knowledge than none, or the worse state-of-affairs that is complete pseudoscience. I have written relevant pieces like The Need For Bias and Why Economic Theory Hurts Us that explain further.

But, I believe an honest man is not at all affected by Demonetisation, GST and RERA. I have stopped believing on false, unfolded and fabricated news syndicated by paid media especially those by NDTV, Firstpost and Huffpost and Bloomberg Quint. These reforms are necessary so that our next generation will see less of corruption, financial frauds and tax stashing. I have personally worked in BFSI industry extensively in past with banking giants in Mumbai and today I work as independent financial consultant. All my friends who still work as product managers in major banks have told me the demand for savings account and credit cards have increased drastically. Post Demonetisation there was flood of housewives outside banks for opening their very first savings account. Construction tycoons have agreed to offer you homes in 100% white money. They are now afraid of the words like ‘black payment’ or ‘down payment’. Traders have actually welcomed GST. Stock brokers are happier than ever. Media will never report this.

What is expected from Government and what should people do on their part?","output":"Chennai is currently facing water crisis, what are the short term and long solutions? What is expected from Government and what should people do on their part? Thanks for A2A Bring regulations to get approval for building new constructions. Because it is a known fact that most part of Chennai sits on waterbodies. And most new buildings are built by destroying the water bodies that are otherwise a catchment area for rainwater.Bringing regulations is the easy part of it. The toughest part is implementing the regulations from the government. This is a careful top-down approach that can work well if properly implemented. But I highly doubt any of these happening because the building industry and the cartels around it are the darker sides of this business that the public might not be aware of. It is tough to bring them under any kind of regulations. Even the public who bought the houses won’t really care about the ethics of living in a building built on a waterbody. #FLOP #FAIL Chennai alone is not facing this crisis. The rest of Tamil Nadu is equally water scarce. It is just that the population density of the Chennai city is making the water problem worse. For another question similar to this, I have answered how the entire Tamil Nadu is slowly becoming a desert. [LINKED_TEXT: Umesh Ramamoorthi's answer to Where do you see Tamil Nadu in the next 5 years?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Where-do-you-see-Tamil-Nadu-in-the-next-5-years/answer/Umesh-Ramamoorthi-1] [LINKED_TEXT: Umesh Ramamoorthi's answer to What will happen to Chennai (India) next with the current water crisis?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-to-Chennai-India-next-with-the-current-water-crisis/answer/Umesh-Ramamoorthi-1] Depopulation of Chennai: There are so many organizations and corporations in Chennai. And the city is getting crowded year by year. Because of a lack of investment in the rest of the cities and rural areas of Tamil Nadu, people flock Chennai from their native places for work. Hence, it is important to depopulate Chennai to ease its burden by bringing jobs in the other parts of Tamil Nadu. There is also a huge population of North Indians in Chennai who recently migrated to doing unskilled jobs. They would also migrate and spread instead of concentrating on a single location if a sustainable infrastructure is developed in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu. Take care of the existing water bodies at least: There are many lakes and ponds in Chennai that are in an improper shape. The public and the government can take care of it so that they have a catchment area prepared for the next rain. There need not be much explanation required for this, as many in Chennai are already working towards it. But the question is, whether that would be enough to feed water to the existing population? Or in Inspite of maintaining them, do Chennai have to steal water from nearby villages and districts?Urban Sewage and rainwater management: Many in started to become aware of using water properly after the crisis. Still, it is not enough. There is a lot of things to be done. Right now the greywater from houses and the rainwater are channeled to flow together underground. Instead, we have to build a proper rainwater management system in the city to harvest it. And also the sewage water must have to be managed better. If possible, recycled. Rainwater Collection: All the above-mentioned points are a top-down approach where the help of the municipality and the local government is essential. Individuals living in Chennai can also take measures at their homes to save enough rainwater. This is a bottom-up approach. There is already enough awareness among the people about the importance of rainwater. It is just that people are really lazy to build another tank and facilitate catching rainwater in it. When they get over it, they can catch rainwater. (Just a picture I found on google. I am not endorsing any party here. :P ) Greywater Treatment at houses: There are many technologies available to treat the greywater that houses let out. These technologies with membranes in it can help us regenerate 40 to 60% of the greywater to be used again. Using proper nozzles: At a microscopic level, if one wants to reduce the water usage of their homes, then one can go for the water-saving nozzles to be fitted in their pipes."},{"instruction":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","output":"Just a guess, a good bit more pride of their surroundings.

While some bloggers may generate substantial income from their blogs, others may struggle to make any significant revenue. However, let's dive into some of the common ways bloggers can potentially earn money: 1️⃣ Advertising: Many bloggers opt for advertising as one of their primary sources of income. They can display banner ads or use pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements such as Google AdSense. The revenue is generated based on the number of clicks or impressions these ads receive. 2️⃣ Affiliate Marketing: Bloggers can promote products or services through affiliate marketing programs and earn a percentage commission on each sale that comes from their referral link. This requires building trust with your audience and promoting relevant products that align with your blog's niche. 3️⃣ Sponsored Content: Bloggers may collaborate with brands or companies to create sponsored content where they feature or review products in exchange for compensation. These partnerships often require disclosure to maintain transparency. 4️⃣ Digital Products: Bloggers can create and sell digital products like e-books, online courses, templates, stock photos, or premium content subscriptions. This allows them to leverage their expertise and provide value to their audience while earning revenue. 5️⃣ Freelance Services: Some bloggers use their blog as a platform to showcase their skills and attract freelance clients for services like writing, graphic design, social media management, or consultation. 6️⃣ Donations or Subscriptions: If your readers appreciate your content and want to support you directly, you can give them the option to donate or subscribe to premium memberships. This relies on building strong relationships with your audience and providing exclusive benefits. It's worth mentioning that the success of monetizing a blog depends on attracting and engaging a substantial audience. This requires consistent creation of high-quality content, effective promotion through social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and building an email list to nurture relationships with your readers. Regarding web hosting, HostGator is a popular choice for bloggers due to its affordable pricing plans and reliable services. They offer various hosting options like shared hosting, dedicated servers, and WordPress hosting. HostGator provides 24/7 customer support, a user-friendly control panel, free website migration, and a 45-day money-back guarantee. Remember, blogging success doesn't happen overnight; it requires dedication, continuous learning, flexibility in adapting to industry trends, and perseverance. While some bloggers may earn a substantial income from their blogs, it often takes time and effort to reach that level. 🌟 So keep creating valuable content, growing your audience organically through SEO and promotion strategies, exploring different monetization methods tailored to your niche, engaging with your readership base authentically—and who knows?

Imagine my shock when my thumb received a shock. I didn’t think about the gold trim around the lip of my cup. The lip of the cup passed through the stream of water and traveled around the lip to where my thumb was touching the gold trim on the other side of the lip.. I had to laugh.

The documentation actually helps personas ranging from newbies to tech say people and much more. Cons of Vue.js: 1) Language barriers become a big challenge when it comes to English speaking engineers. 2) Sometimes many features can make it look overwhelming, thus making it difficult for developer teams to choose the right option. 3) Lack of community becomes quite a lag, this is simply because it is the newest of technologies and needs more time to evolve & adopt more techies."},{"instruction":"here been an increase in UFO activity since the Voyager satellite left our solar system?","output":"I think UFO sightings sort of come and go, back in the 60’s and 70’s there were many stories about these sightings then they seemed to just go away; my assumption is that if these are real then they have been around a long time and so having sent vehicles from Earth to a point beyond the Solar System will make no difference at all. Now it is believed that these Unidentified Aerial Phenomena go back to the ending of World War Two and in particular to the detonation of atomic devices. We cannot be sure if these things even exist, they may be something that our science cannot explain and not aliens but I digress, so we are now seeing these things again and some governments are now more open that there are things that they cannot explain using normal science. Lastly; who says we have sent probes beyond our Solar System? The Oort Cloud reaches out half way to the nearest star system meaning that none of our devices like Voyager have yet left our star system."},{"instruction":"Are atoms observable? If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","output":"Well The answer would, of course, depend on your definition of \\"observe.\\" With our eyes? Obviously not. Using a microscope? Still no, as others have pointed out. I'm not sure when the theory came about. Allegedly some philosopher once was given credit for coming up with the idea, but it's a fairly common thread and I think he had the right idea. There probably is some level of indivisibily (that things can't be broken down after a certain point) but we now know this isn't the atom. At the time and for quite a while after we proved their existence we still thought that to be the case, but later realized there was some underlying mechanics to how they behaved and that led to the realization that there were more components and so forth. We now are beginning to (I believe) arrive at the conclusion that at the end of the day there is no real matter at all and that it's merely a set of purely abstract rules that... Perhaps only exist in theory, not materially. But never the less, in the same way we view our reality to be real, we can account for atoms, if not through direct observation, then by inference as is typically the case with all scientific discoveries, at least nowadays that science is far exceeding our grasp as mere mortals. We must use things far beyond our senses to obvserve the universe. In the case of the images people displayed those were done with electron microscopes, thus contradicting the idea of the atom in their existence, but allowing us to observe something so small we once thought there could be nothing smaller. Since light literally can't be resolved any further than the frequency of the wave (otherwise it's a shot in the dark that you will even detect anything since its all empty space anyway) we had to find another way to make an image and this was done by firing electrons (presumably in a particular way at different angles (I'm guessing) in order to react with some kind of photographic plate of a larger size) that we can detect with optical instruments and ultimately our eyes). Anyway, so to answer your question, can we see them? Idk, can we really see anything for sure? Hehe.

One notable current example is the ISS, which has been in a unchanged orbit for many years and, more importantly, is quite large compared with other satellites with a distinctive profile making it easy to observe and identify. Astronomical observatories or academic departments often publish schedules listing available times for space station overflights visible from their local areas. A more notorious current example has been the frequent launches into orbit of Spacex Starlink satellites, which appear as so-called “trains” of dozens of satellites moving like man-made stars across the pre-dawn or post-dusk skies all over the world. These have been frequently observed and much appreciated by enthusiasts all over the world as they make their way towards their ultimate orbital destinations, forming a global network of thousands of communications satellites. Astronomers have been less appreciative, finding the satellites to leave streaks of unwanted light across their carefully composed astronomical photographs. Spacex has responded by redesigning the more recent generations of satellites to make them less reflective, a still-ongoing project. First demonstrations of their communications capabilities are coming out as of autumn 2020, delivering the excellent communications performance for which they were designed. It seems that the project will be a huge success and a huge money-maker for Spacex, and a great benefit to people around the world who have been cut off from internet and other communications services by obstacles from geography and terrain, not to mention ships at sea or aircraft in flight. This situation is very much in flux, so you might want to put your efforts towards observing the ISS, which is likely to remain readily observable for the foreseeable future."},{"instruction":"Why don't people do their homework and study it out to realize Obama is a communist?","output":"Who the f**k cares?

It lost the 2010 election because of perceived mismanagement of the economy. And I think that perception was correct. I think that they spent far too much money propping up banks and while it was right to support Lloyds, I think that Royal Bank of Scotland should have been put into a managed liquidation, much the same way as Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley were. It was said that Royal Bank of Scotland was too big to be allowed to fail but it was also the case that it had debts that were too large to be supported. It was a bit of a Catch 22 but I do think that managed bankruptcy would have been the lesser evil, as far as the economy was concerned. One way that it could have been done is to sell off NatWest with only viable debts and then sell the personal and business current accounts of RBS, leaving a hulk that could go bankrupt. Even now, the company is somewhat zombified. It might eventually recover but at a huge long-term cost to the country. The elections of 2015, 2017 and 2019 were lost because Labour lurched further and further to the left and created less and less believable manifestos. In 2017, the apparent revival of Labour was wholly fuelled by the Conservatives’ disastrous campaign. In 2019, the Conservatives slightly improved their vote share from a high base and Labour slumped back to just above where it was in 2015. Labour’s outgoing leadership is made up of Marxists and Trotskyites. Such extreme views do not appeal to the British public and however much the manifesto was window dressed, the far-left views of the leadership showed. Momentum likes to present itself as an ordinary group of left-wing people that collectively acts to influence Labour but it is actually the most successful entryist movement that I am aware of in history. It has usurped Labour from centrists (within Labour, actually quite left-wing) and moderates. Momentum has managed to discredit Tony Blair and his entire New Labour movement, despite the fact that he was Labour’s most successful leader in the party’s history. Yes, Tony Blair made some serious errors and led the UK into the Second Iraq War in support of the US and the judgments he made leading up to that were seriously flawed. Few people dispute that. But, set aside that the good he did both for his party and the country. Like most leaders, he was neither all good nor all bad but Momentum make him out to be the devil! Even the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats acknowledge the good he did in some areas but the Labour left see him as all bad. Momentum is a significant reason why many people won’t vote Labour for the foreseeable future, even if they’re Labour’s natural constituency. To win again, Labour needs to embrace the political centre, as it did under Tony Blair."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"Physics.

They may also feel that they have nowhere else to go or that no one else will have them. Another reason people stay is because they believe their partner will change.

I consider myself to be a pretty intelligent person and knowledgeable in a lot of different things, I've had a lot of people tell me I'm smart but I would never, ever, ever represent myself in a court of law. You will never be as good as a lawyer who specializes in the type of case being tried. There are so many tactics and basic steps and proceedings and rules of how things are done in court that if not done right, you will definitely lose the case.

Houston went first and you can’t say they went wrong with Olajuwon. The Blazers went second and selected Sam Bowie who ended up a bust, but they already had Clyde Drexler at Jordan’s position.

If not, why is Vietnamese bolero called bolero instead of something else?","output":"Bolero was brought to Vietnam by the French Colonialists, during the “Jazz age” in Paris and New Orleans. Many older people in Vietnam practice many Latin dances in current day Vietnam, and recently the youth are rediscovering ballroom dancing and have clubs dedicated to these Latin and American dances. The Vietnamese have added their own flare and style to these dances. It is rudimentary the same as the steps I practiced in Miami and Havana. The tempo and Rhythm of the band is the biggest difference from the Caribbean style. In Vietnam the dances are called what the French named them, for example: Salsa, Rhumba, Hop, Swing, Waltz, and Bolero. These dances are mostly practiced with a Vietnamese cultural interpretation and they are avid enthusiasts. They know the history of these art forms and probably don't need to verbally express it. If you have to ask, they'd probably infer you should probably go to a dance class. The Vietnamese are very polite and friendly."},{"instruction":"f(x) = (1)^x","output":"1,-1"},{"instruction":"f you are a medical worker, have you ever experienced a patient full out faking?","output":"Not a medical worker, but a patient medical workers believed to be faking. When I was about 12 or 13 I started having pain in my right thigh/hip (which would gradually move toward my back) after a couple days my mom took me to a walk in clinic kinda thing incase it was something more than growing pains. According to research I did, it kinda felt like a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) I just didn't have many of the other symptoms. Doctor checks me out, nothing seems out of the ordinary. Tells me to take advil, which I had tried (but it didn't help) and see my GP if the pain persists. The pain got worse and began moving to my back so I went to my GP (who was awful) who checked me out, didn't really find much because my only symptoms were pain and fatigue and he gave me a prescription for basically Aleve (which I had tried, it didn't help), and tells me to try that, go do some lab work (which I did promptly) and send him if the pain persists. Pain gets worse yet. The time of day was right and my mom was fed up enough that she just took me to the ER. They checked me out, did some bloodwork, I think did some kind of scanning/imaging. Couldn't find anything. Gave me a prescription for tylenol-3 (tylenol with codeine) which I had already tried, it didn't help. And told me to come back or see my GP if the pain persists. One night it got really bad and my mom took me to the ER, I wrote an answer to a question here on quora about that night. At this point it's starting to sound odd because a GP, walk in clinic, and another ER hadn't found anything. They however give me a shot of some much more powerful painkiller and that was the first night I wasn't in pain for months, but of course they can't give a prescription for that drug, however they can give me a very small prescription of a similar drug but a very small one and I'd have to see my GP to get more. Well the pain is still bad. I went back to my GP, he wouldn't even keep up with the now used up Tylenol-3 the first ER trip got me. My bloodwork and scans were clean. That was when he decided to ‘talk’ with me and heavily suggest that losing weight would solve all my problems. He implied that not only was I in pain because I was overweight (by about 20-30 pounds), but he also implied that the weight was causing me to not have friends and maybe if I lost weight, I'd get friends, and I wouldn't be in pain anymore because my friends would pay attention to me. He sent me away with more knock-off and more expensive Aleve-drug prescription and the suggestion to see a nutritionist and another doctor at a different clinic. I go see this other doctor because my GP made an appointment for me with this woman. She listened and decided my pain would go away if I drank more water. So at this point I'd been in pain for 3 months, had tried every other the counter pain medication out there with no relief, and was being told my problems would go away if I drank water, lost weight, or made friends. I was frustrated and this was making me feel more depressed then I already had been. I gave up and suffered in silence, I told my mom the pain disappeared even though it lingered for another month before gradually disappearing. I later found out that clinical depression can manifest it's self as physical pain. I had been depressed before, during, and after. So I really was in pain, but there was no injury or physical illness to cause it. My GP, the other doctor, and multiple ER docs and nurses, all thought I was faking, looking for attention, and/or looking for drugs because no one thought to ask me during this how I felt mentally and emotionally. Looking back, I'm mad at myself for not figuring it out sooner, and I'm mad at the GP and other doctor who barely knew me, saw me as a 12–13 y/o girl who was probably just looking for attention and wrote my pain off as nothing. I won't say it was a ‘when you hear hooves pounding, assume horses not zebras’ kinda thing, but it wasn't an obvious answer that medical professionals never figured out."},{"instruction":"When is the right time to hire a virtual assistant for your Amazon Fba business?","output":"when your business is at his peak and its difficult to manage so you can hire a VA who can tackle all the things for or if you have investment but dont have a time to work so you can also hire a virtual assistent one of the most brillant VA is giving his services on Fiver so you can contact him if you want here is a link [LINKED_TEXT: https://bit.ly/3MgWqhy] [URL: https://bit.ly/3MgWqhy]"},{"instruction":"there anything about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash that just doesn’t add up?","output":"In the helicopters I have flown in, they had radar altimeters, which give immediate distance to the ground.

When all dreaming collapses, what is left is witnessing, pitch blackness with utter peace and eternal vastness, no sense and trace of motion of any kind. Non of that is a state even, because a state is something that is of consciousness. There is something that i can’t really put into words, i would not call it a sense because it would not be accurate, but it is something like aliveness or being, yet it is not a being like existing. There is simply witnessing behind all this that we call experience/existence. In that pitch blackness a light shines for eternity, there is an eternal rest in light and peace.

Regi George, who is now 52, and Lalitha Regi, now 51, had found the tribal people of the region to be the worst sufferers in the country as far as health care was concerned when they first met them so they started an outpatient unit in 1993 at a small thatched hut. They started off with a bit of our personal savings and because the tribal people were very friendly, they helped us with the materials and the labour for putting up a mud and thatch hut. The situation was so bad that till 1992, one in every five children died before celebrating the first birthday and many mothers died during childbirth. For the people of the state, reaching the nearest hospital was a tough task since there was no proper public transport and the nearest hospital was 48 km away. Today, THI has not just grown into a full-fledged 24-bed primary care hospital in Sittilingi valley but also runs outreach clinics, besides conducting educational programmes in 21 villages. They see about 150-200 out patients in a day thrice a week. Also, the tribal girls were trained as health workers. The infant mortality rate decreased from 147 to 2 in thousand. They also invited a psychiatrist to counsel and treat these youngsters. THI is currently working on a programme to ensure mental health among the tribals.

Christianity was initially just one of the many religious groups competing for influence and by Constantine the Great’s age, Christians made up around 10% of the population, mainly concentrated in the East. The privileges that Constantine and his sons conferred on the Christian Church, such as allowing bishops to offer judgments in civil cases and the right to use the public posting system for travel, as well as their patronizing of the faith meant that Christianity was able to spread rapidly around the Empire and in 380 Theodosius I the Great made Nicene Christianity the official faith of the Roman Empire. Although there remained pagans in the Roman (Byzantine) Senate until the reign of Justinian (527 - 565) and rural populations in the interior of Asia Minor retained pagan customs until the seventh century (and possibly even later), it was clear that Christianity had become the dominant religion in the Empire. While whether Christianity was morally superior or not to the pagan religions of ancient Rome is something that depends on one’s personal views, Christianity did have some beneficial moral effects. The Christian religion’s attitude towards warfare has long been criticized, especially by Enlightenment scholars, as undermining the Roman martial ethos. While such attitudes were exaggerated, it is generally true that Christianity did not have a wholly positive view of warfare and one could argue that this was a moral improvement. The view of Basil of Caesarea (330 - 379), highly influential in the Orthodox Church, was: Our fathers did not consider killings committed in the course of wars to be classifiable as murders at all, on the score, it seems to me, of allowing a pardon to men fighting in defense of sobriety and piety. Perhaps, though, it might be advisable to refuse them communion for three years, on the ground that their hands are not clean. Of course, not everyone had such strict views on warfare. In his Letter to Amun, Athanasius (328 – 373) had a somewhat less strict view: Although one is not supposed to kill, the killing of the enemy in time of war is both a lawful and praiseworthy thing. This is why we consider individuals who have distinguished themselves in war as being worthy of great honors, and indeed public monuments are set up to celebrate their achievements. It is evident, therefore, that at one particular time, and under one set of circumstances, an act is not permissible, but when time and circumstances are right, it is both allowed and condoned. Nevertheless, it is generally true that the Church’s attitude towards warfare was different than before. When Emperor Nicephorus Phocas proposed that all soldiers who fall in battle against Muslims should be named martyrs, the patriarch Polyeuctus (956 to 970 ) refused his demand. The Christian religion also encouraged welfare towards the poorest in society. The early Christian communities encouraged Christians to offer support to those in need (for example offering free food, etc.) and this aided the spread of Christianity. This attitude towards welfare was continued by the organized Christian Church. The Church thus played an active role in civic life, funding hospitals, poorhouses, and hospices and also ensuring the retention of institutional bathing as an element of Roman/Byzantine life in major cities, especially Constantinople. The establishment of hospitals was especially important not only in terms of welfare but also in developing healthcare. In \\"Xenons\\" hospitals, mainly attached to Monasteries, there was the possibility for offering systematic and organized medical care: internal medicine, surgery, gynaecology, and ophthalmology were practiced in corresponding separate wings. The state also did establish hospitals, orphanages which housed, fed and educated orphans, in­stitutions for lepers, and hospices and inns in various cities and on roads to provide food and shelter for travelers. In fact some scholars argue that the origins of the welfare state go back to Roman/Byzantine welfare policies, which were decisively influenced by the Christian Church. Christianity also had a more positive influence in the treatment of slaves. For example marking slaves with hot iron, as it was happening some cases, was banned while the ability of masters to put to death their slaves for no reason was severely restricted. Emperor Justinian’s laws ensured that freed slaves would have full civic rights and simplified the procedure for freeing slaves. Castrating a slave automatically made them free. Emperor Leo IV allowed slaves to dispose property in wills. Slaves were not allowed to marry but this was legalized by Alexios Komnenos in 1095. The legal system, under the influence of Christian morality also moved in a more humane direction. A prisoner would not be kept in total darkness but had to be given the outdoors and daylight. Constantine the Great prohibited the abduction of girls and instituted punishment for such abductors. Constantine also made divorce harder, imposing severe conditions when demands came from only one side. A man could divorce his wife for reasons of adultery, poisoning, and pandering; in that case he would retain her dowry. If he divorced for another reason however, he had to return the dowry and was forbidden to marry again. Gladiatorial games were ordered to be eliminated in 325. - Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral Christianity also influenced the imperial office. The Christian Roman/Byzantine Emperor was expected to exemplify Christian virtues. While there were plenty of bad and cruel Christian Roman Emperors, there was no Caligula or Nero and such behavior was not tolerated for long. The Emperor had to show, even for reasons of propaganda only, virtues such as generosity and restraint. When the Emperor failed to exude such virtues, he was either branded a tyrant or had to repent (either truly or for PR reasons). An example of this was the reaction to the massacre of Thessalonica. In 390, the troops of Emperor Theodosius the Great massacred the inhabitants of Thessalonica as punishment for the murder of Butheric (magister militum of Illyria). Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, stood up to the Emperor upon hearing news of the massacre. He refused to celebrate a mass in the Emperor's presence, until Theodosius repented. For eight months Theodosius was weeping and he was forgiven only after he had agree to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution. Overall, while whether Christianity was morally superior to the pagan religions of Rome is something that is dependent on one’s personal views, it is indisputable that the Christian Church had at least some positive moral impact on the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"Which is your favourite World Test Championship knock?","output":"Rishabh pant knock of 89 against Australia at Gabba in the series decider is my favourite WTC knock.

In my opinion, happiness can be subjective and influenced by various factors. From where I stand, I see three fundamental elements that consistently contribute to human happiness. Meaningful RelationshipsPursuit of Personal Growth and MeaningGratitude and Mindfulness I have seen that good-quality relationships help humans be happy even if they live in a war-torn country. Meaningful relationships encompass not only family bonds but also friendships, romantic partnerships, and even connections within communities and social circles. Prioritizing the cultivation of meaningful relationships can significantly impact an individual's overall happiness. Finding purpose and meaning can take various forms, including pursuing meaningful careers, engaging in hobbies, contributing to the community through volunteer work, or developing a spiritual connection. It is essential to explore one's interests and continually strive for personal development to unlock the path to long-lasting happiness. Being grateful and appreciating the positive aspects of life, even amidst challenges and difficulties, is an undeniable truth for beginning to be happy in life. Finally, as individuals, we have the power to shape our own happiness by fostering positive connections, embracing personal growth, and cultivating gratitude and mindfulness.

Maintaining optimal blood sugar levels is essential for overall health and well-being. In this article, we will explore effective strategies to control blood sugar levels naturally and improve overall health. Understanding Blood Sugar # What is blood sugar? Blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, is the primary source of energy for the body's cells. It comes from the food we eat, and insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps transport glucose into the cells to be used for energy. # The importance of controlling blood sugar Balancing blood sugar levels is vital because consistently high levels can lead to complications such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney problems. On the other hand, low blood sugar levels can cause dizziness, confusion, and, in severe cases, unconsciousness. Healthy Eating Habits # Incorporating a balanced diet One of the most effective ways to control blood sugar is by adopting a balanced diet. Focus on consuming whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid sugary and processed foods, as they can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. # Portion control Controlling portion sizes is crucial, as even healthy foods can impact blood sugar if consumed excessively. By managing portion sizes, you can better manage your glucose levels and prevent unnecessary fluctuations. Regular Physical Activity # The benefits of exercise Engaging in regular physical activity can significantly impact blood sugar levels. Exercise helps your body use glucose more efficiently, making it easier to maintain stable levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. # Types of exercises Combining aerobic exercises, such as brisk walking or cycling, with strength training can be especially beneficial for blood sugar control. Exercise not only improves insulin sensitivity but also aids in weight management, which is crucial for those at risk of diabetes. Managing Stress # Understanding the stress-blood sugar connection Chronic stress can lead to elevated blood sugar levels due to the release of stress hormones. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature, can help regulate blood sugar levels. Quality Sleep # The link between sleep and blood sugar Inadequate sleep can disrupt insulin production and lead to insulin resistance, causing blood sugar levels to rise. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support overall health and maintain stable glucose levels. Hydration # The role of water Staying well-hydrated is essential for optimal blood sugar control. Water helps flush out excess sugar from the bloodstream and supports kidney function, which is crucial for individuals with diabetes. Limiting Alcohol Consumption # Alcohol's impact on blood sugar Excessive alcohol consumption can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and interfere with diabetes medications. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation and always with food to help stabilize blood sugar levels. Regular Blood Sugar Monitoring # Importance of monitoring Regularly checking blood sugar levels is vital for understanding how your body responds to different foods and activities. It allows you to make informed decisions about your diet and lifestyle. Medication Management # Taking prescribed medications For individuals with diabetes, taking prescribed medications as directed by their healthcare provider is essential for blood sugar control. Never adjust medication dosages without consulting a healthcare professional. Conclusion Taking control of your blood sugar levels is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. By adopting a balanced diet, staying physically active, managing stress, getting quality sleep, staying hydrated, and monitoring blood sugar levels, you can lead a healthier and more fulfilling life. FAQs 1. **Can I reverse diabetes by controlling my blood sugar?** While lifestyle changes can significantly improve blood sugar levels and even lead to remission in some cases, diabetes is a complex condition, and not everyone can reverse it entirely. However, managing blood sugar effectively can greatly enhance one's quality of life. 2. **Is it necessary to take medication for blood sugar control?** For some individuals with diabetes, lifestyle changes alone may not be sufficient to manage blood sugar levels. Medication may be prescribed to achieve optimal glucose control, but it should always be done under medical supervision. 3. **How often should I check my blood sugar levels?** The frequency of blood sugar monitoring may vary depending on individual health conditions and the type of diabetes. Consult your healthcare provider to determine the appropriate testing schedule for you. 4. **Are there any specific foods that can help lower blood sugar levels?** Yes, certain foods, such as leafy greens, cinnamon, and nuts, have been associated with blood sugar-lowering properties. However, they should be part of a well-balanced diet and not used as a sole treatment method. 5. **Can stress alone cause diabetes?** Stress does not cause diabetes directly, but it can contribute to insulin resistance and impact blood sugar levels. Managing stress through healthy coping mechanisms is essential for overall health, including blood sugar control.

Dear Wife, I’m writing you this letter to tell you that I’m leaving you forever. I’ve been a good man to you for 7 years & I have nothing to show for it. These last 2 weeks have been hell. … Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today & that was the last straw. Last week, you came home & didn’t even notice I had a new haircut, had cooked your favorite meal & even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers. You ate in 2 minutes, & went straight to sleep after watching all of your soaps. You don’t tell me you love me anymore; you don’t want sex or anything that connects us as husband & wife. Either you’re cheating on me or you don’t love me anymore; whatever the case, I’m gone. Your EX-Husband P.S. don’t try to find me. Your SISTER & I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life! Dear Ex-Husband, Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It’s true you & I have been married for 7 years, although a good man is a far cry from what you’ve been. I watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining & griping. Too bad that doesn’t work. I did notice when you got a haircut last week, but the 1st thing that came to mind was ‘You look just like a girl!’. Since my mother raised me not to say anything if you can’t say something nice, I didn’t comment. And when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY SISTER, because I stopped eating pork 7 years ago. About those new silk boxers: I turned away from you because the 49.99 price tag was still on them, & I prayed it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed 50 from me that morning. After all of this, I still loved you & felt we could work it out. So when I hit the lotto for 10 million dollars, I quit my job & bought us 2 tickets to Jamaica. But when I got home you were gone... Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you won’t get a dime from me. So take care. Signed, Your Ex-Wife, Rich As Hell & Free! P.S. I don’t know if I ever told you this, but my sister Carla was born Carl. I hope that’s not a problem. Source: A Whatsapp forward.

It makes sense - parents willing to spend money on school while also already paying property taxes to fund public schools have a unique social pressure to perform in ways public school students don’t. That pressure can also exist on public school students from society and parents (such as top notch public schools), but in an environment where detractors (drugs, bad kids, bullies, stupid kids, troublemakers) exist, it can sabotage that pressure. Those detractors can and do exist in private school, but there are more checks against them."},{"instruction":"What's the best thing I can do as a 15 year old?","output":"Stay strong and straight. 4 yrs to go"},{"instruction":"f the gold standard is a conservative ideal, why was Nixon the one who destroyed it, and why has no conservative president tried to restore it?","output":"FDR did that."},{"instruction":"Unlockmaker (the free online unlocker app) a scam?","output":"This is not a scam service. 100% trusted service.

You haven’t given your age, or whether you are pre- or post-menopausal. You haven’t even given your sex, as breast cancer in men (which accounts for 1% of cases) is often treated by mastectomy. I assume that by HR positive you mean ER positive, or maybe you don’t. What about the progestagen receptors? What about the excision margins? Were they clear? Close? Involved? What about other pathology, medical history, medicines you might be taking, family history, occupation… ? There are many different factors to take into account when advising on treatment. Is this the final diagnosis or is it provisional? In the UK all oncology pathology results have to be reviewed by a pathologist specialising in that specific cancer, and then the case discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting before any course of management can be recommended. When I was treating breast cancer (over 20 years ago) wide local excision combined with radiotherapy was regarded as an alternative to mastectomy for smallish, low-grade tumours, and combining them would be overkill. Similarly, the thinking was that if the tumour was low-grade and the nodes not involved then the chance of recurrence was sufficiently low that adding chemotherapy would not make a great deal of difference. With ER or PR positivity there is also the option of hormone treatment. However, that was 20 years ago and there has been a great deal of change in oncology treatment since then. You will get a much better answer from seeing an oncologist who knows you and has access to all the details of your case, as well as the opportunity to confirm them all."},{"instruction":"Will Akhilesh Yadav be able to form his government this time in the Uttar Pradesh 2022 elections?","output":"Chances are very less for ex-CM Akhilesh Yadav to win 2022 elections and to form his Govt. in UP as he's not done anything in the last five years for the people in the State, as a responsible Opposition except doing vaccination politics as against BJP Govt.

The men you see in the red suits and black hats standing outside Buckingham Palace, months before would have been in sand-coloured desert combat gear and duking it out against the Taliban. That’s the important thing to remember: they are trained infantry soldiers whose primary role is to fight! They just also have ceremonial duties sometimes, too. Their weapon is the L85A2 assault rifle, same as used by all the British Army (some units now receiving the A3 upgrade). Whether in combat in Afghanistan or guarding Buckingham Palace, it’s the same weapon they have. Though in the latter it’ll be more polished, cleaner, and will have a polished bayonet on the end. They have a 30-round magazine of live ammunition loaded into it and are ready to respond at a moment’s notice should anything untoward happen, such as someone trying to storm into the Palace."},{"instruction":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","output":"This is a picture of a Peepal leaf from the tree infront of my house in Delhi. I have captured it few days back in 3rd of November. The right side is kept as it is and the left side has been cleaned by me just to show the contrasting shades of the same leaf. When I started moving my fingers over it, I found thick layers of dust present on the leaf. I am not talking about a single layer but several layers. I started observing such huge amount of dust (pollutants) since the start of october. Unfortunately, I have not clicked any picture of the leaf back then but it looked something similar to the left side. Here is a picture of a leaf from the same tree taken in the rainy season. No dust particles present on it due to the rain. Even the colour is vibrant due to the seasonal effect. The colour is supposed to be changed by November for sure but that is not the point. The point is about the layer of pollutants which can be seen adding a pale look to the leaves. Diwali is yet to arrive but I have already started feeling the pollution around me. It is quite easily felt through the nose and eyes. You don't need any special equipment to detect it. You can literally smell it. Now coming to the main question. I will always support banning crackers on Diwali. But is that enough ? Absolutely not. Banning only crackers and that too only on Diwali is similar to protecting yourself from a heavy rain with just your hands over your head. It may help you to save a small portion of your head from getting wet but it cannot save you from the real damage. You'll be wet head to toe. And if you are lucky then your mobile phone will be still working fine. A report by Central Pollution Control Board found that vehicular and industrial pollution is the primary reason for the air pollution in Delhi. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #PKBcp] It is true that the pollution level increases beyond what is already accepted as hazardous during diwali and the subsequent 2–3 days. People with respiratory problems find it very difficult on these days. Who knows several deaths also must be happening due to this but never got reported. The bigger as well as effective solution is somewhere else. Banning crackers in Diwali is welcome but its effect is reflected only on newspaper headlines and does no good in reducing the pollution significantly on an average. We need better solutions. We need the governemt to act on eco-friendly solutions. We need the people to adopt eco-friendly solutions. It is a combined task for all of us. We can't stop everything but we can control the things for a certain extent for sure.

No! Try not to eat many sweet foods such as biscuits, cakes, chocolate, slices, although an occasional small serve of the above is OK. If the medical professional examined the diets of women with breast cancer they would probably find that they eat a lot of dairy foods such as cheese, yoghurt, butter, cream, milk amd other types of dairy. These should be reduced considerably along with reducing meat intake, alcohol and fried foods. It is necessary also to increase intake of water- not tap water or bottled water, but home-filtered water and aim to drink between 6–8 glasses per day, along with a daily vegetable juice. Doctors do need to lift their game and start to do their own research on the diets of women with breast cancer to see if there is a pattern of certain foods which could reveal a link which might be associated with breast cancer??

Not that the evidence to support your case is not abundantly available, its that some people are so emotionally devoted to their belief that no amount of evidence will make any difference. Your more likely to encounter a case of cognitive dissonance if you present logical objective evidence that refutes the premise they are emotionally attached too. That being said, you might start with helping your spouse understand the Bible objectively.. That God does exist, Jesus is real, but that the stories as we have them in the Bible have been passed down and exaggerated over time. Case point.. David and Goliath.. The story in the Bible as many have it.. is Goliath was 6 cubits and a span.. 9 foot 6 inches. The largest person verified to have lived is only 8 foot 11 - Robert Wadlow he died fairly young.. because as medically understood the human physiology doesn’t scale up.. People of that size are really frail gentle giants.. So 9 foot 6 inches would seem formidable, except he probably wouldn’t have lasted one battle, so how does Goliath get the fame? Enter the Dead Sea Scrolls.. which has a scroll that describes Goliath as 4 cubits and a span.. 6′ 6″ A much more physiologically sound. A warrior of that stature would be about 1 foot taller than the average man of the time, and not beyond the limits of human anatomy.. The point of this is to demonstrate the stories get exaggerated for religious purposes. An interesting bit to the goliath story , is that the difference between an Hebrew 4 and 6 is the length of a stroke in the character.. short stroke is 6 , long stroke is 4. So it’s likely that at scribe wrote a shorter than normal stroke for the height of Goliath.. changing thus making him 6 cubits and a span versus four cubits and a span.. the exaggeration works for religious purposes so it carried on.. So back to Noah.. the story is likely based upon a real event.. The Bosporus Break, which flooded the area we now know is the Black Sea. One must look at the story from the eyes of those who would have experienced it and passed it down. A stone aged man living in the valley of where the Black Sea is , may have received some divine inspiration to build a vessel to save his family and livestock from an impending deluge. When the Bosporus broke and poured the Mediterranean sea into the valley which now comprises the Black Sea.. coincide this with a rain storm that lasted many days.. and you have the making of the story.. Noah , living in such a valley would not likely have seen the Bosporus breach, but simply experienced the water levels rising to the point that “His” entire world (What he can observe- probably less than 100 miles in any direction) was completely covered in water. To Noah, the entire earth has been flooded.. until his craft came to rest on the “mountains of Ararat”.. not to be confused with Mt Ararat. the former being a region in ancient Armenia. So his story is passed along orally for thousands of years. Likely embellished and exaggerated for moral religious purposes until it was written into the manuscripts we have for the Biblical Text... So perhaps you can reassure your spouse that the God is real, there was a person like Noah, but the Bible text isn’t the inerrant word of God, such would make it a sort of Idol.. Instead, it maybe God inspired, it may “contain” God’s inerrant word to people of ancient times, but it also contains the word so fallible humans as well. God may have inspired it’s original authors, but that inspiration was meant for an ancient people, not us, and it wasn’t necessarily intended to be preserved.. that was a effort of fallible men.. and the manuscript evidence proves that men did a fairly poor job of preserving.. So the inerrant Word of God comes from only one source… God himself, not a translation of an ancient text that has passed through many many fallible human hands and minds. Encourage your spouse to go straight to the source.. Hope that helps."},{"instruction":"What's a good digital marketing agency in the UAE?","output":"Webdigitalize [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #DtfvW] top digtial marketing agency in dubai.

Sometimes I wonder if I would’ve liked living in the 1800s better because there wasn’t as many people and there wasn’t phones and computers everywhere. But then again, I love the outdoors and that’s why I got rid of my office jobs. It’s spending too much time indoors, too much TV, too much Facebook, and comparing yourself to others! There are some conspiracy theories that you may want to take a look at that are fairly compelling. But, it’s traffic, more people… Which means more crime, more confrontations, more arguments, more competition. Pressures nowadays are different from pressures years ago. People used to live more simple lives. I’m not talking about the farmer who grows his crops and goes home to his wife at night and reads a book to the kids on the farm. I am referring to the modern day complexities and all of the different issues that are available at our fingertips. People back then couldn’t pull up the latest news on their phone and find out that we just gave Ukraine 2 billion worth of 16s when we could have been feeding our own citizens and veterans. didn’t mean to get political just then, but anyway… Life’s just more complicated nowadays.

Like other relationships, coordination and consistency are needed in the one among you and your team. And what good strategy to take the opportunity to relax down to assure the staff knows the goals and they can do it? Here are 5 steps you can take any time you have a sprint preparation meeting. Step 1: Evaluate Your Product Roadmap An agile sprint is aimed at delivering improved applications. Yet it is said better than finished. When you’re knee-deep in code changes, it’s simple to lose vision of the bigger image. How do you do the correct thing about what you’re concentrating on? As the product owner, you must still have a high-level vision of the work in mind. You have to check the project roadmap and urge critical questions before discussing or doing some form of sprint preparation. Are you designing features that drive your vision for the product forward? Can you have a view of the work, or are you just responding to noisy consumers? The first step in sprint preparation is to decide where you want to be in 6 months, a year, or longer, not just after this sprint. Step 2: Have an Updated List of User Stories Before the Sprint Planning Meeting In an ideal, transparent environment, the team will pick up the words you have written about users a month ago and quickly start working on them. That’s rarely the case. Your users would have been requesting for many functionalities to be added to your product after your last update. You will have to take in all these factors to make adjustments to the customer stories to make sure they are tested before heading into the preparation meeting for sprints. Now the dilemma most teams have is, “how many customer stories are we going to update?” The perfect scenario is to update them all. But, unless the product is relatively new and thin, that is an unlikely feat. Step 3: Meeting Arrangements Send the invite and make sure that all your teammates are able to attend the meeting without any inconvenience. Print the target of the sprint and position it somewhere conspicuous in the conference space. Have freely available sticky notes in various colors. Write down team speed in bold letters. Write down a reference rate (agreed upon by everyone), which may be the last sprint speed or an average of the previous three sprints. It will help if you use a comparison velocity of 8 story points per programmer per sprint if it’s the first sprint for your team. Ensure that it is obvious what each sticky color reflects. For starters, green is for stories about people, blue is for tasks, and purple is for bugs. Get the stories written on the stickies and place them in preference order on the wall. Be sure to do the same with remote teams, like in the sprint or backlog. Also, arrange light refreshments or coffee and make sure that the environment is comfortable. Step 4: Utilize Data and Expertise to Supercharge Your Sprint Planning Conference The sprint preparation meeting(s) will set the tone for the following few working weeks or months. The more planning you can do in advance, the better. That’s why the [LINKED_TEXT: Scrum Guide] [URL: https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide] recommends timeboxing the sprint preparation meeting for a month-long sprint to just 8 hours. Your schedules should be changed accordingly for faster sprints. Your scrum master is accountable for ensuring these discussions happen and the team is sticking to the list. Step 5: Collaboratively Plan a Sprint Backlog It’s time to worry about the “how” you’re going to do it with a sprinting target in mind. Sprint Backlog is a list of several user stories that you have updated in the previous steps and predicted. The challenge is to find a list of user accounts, assignments, and glitches that can help you accomplish the goal and can be achieved within the sprint’s span. The team must choose the sprint things and scale of the sprint backlog collectively. Since they are the individuals who contribute to the fulfillment of the products, they also have to be the ones who pick what they contribute."},{"instruction":"Without looking at a map, how well can you draw the shape of your country?","output":"Well, let’s see… Australia, huh?

Going in order, JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy, carefully curated his public image as a family man, but behind closed doors, he was a prolific womanizer who didn't bother to hide his affairs from his family. As a father, I'm sometimes surprised at how many meaningless (to me) things I do/say ultimately resonate with my children, but there's no mystery about the Kennedy household: the boys were taught that they didn't owe their wives faithfulness and that they could do whatever they wanted in their private lives as long as they maintained public appearances. As a child growing up in such an environment, JFK was likely to go in one of two directions: either he would reject his father's behavior or imitate it. He obviously went with door #2. And second, I'm reminded of an old Norm Mcdonald joke about Tiger Woods; the punchline was that given the hundreds of opportunities he had to cheat every day, he was actually a pretty good husband in comparison to the average guy who might have 5 chances to cheat in his lifetime. JFK was not anyone's idea of a model husband, but he did have women throwing themselves at him right and left, which he obviously took advantage of as a reckless playboy."},{"instruction":"w do travel websites like Trivago work?","output":"Website live Trivago is Metasearch engines.

Some of the possible factors include: Social media: Social media can be a double-edged sword, as it can provide a platform for connection and communication, but it can also create feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The constant exposure to carefully curated images and updates from peers can create a sense of inadequacy and FOMO (fear of missing out).Academic pressure: Young people today are under immense pressure to excel academically and succeed in a highly competitive job market. The stress of maintaining good grades, balancing extracurricular activities, and preparing for standardized tests can take a toll on mental health.Economic insecurity: Many young people today face economic uncertainty and instability, with high student debt, low-paying jobs, and a lack of affordable housing. This can create feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can contribute to depression.Environmental factors: The fast-paced, technology-driven society of today can be overwhelming and stressful, leading to feelings of anxiety and burnout.Stigma: Despite the increasing awareness and acceptance of mental health issues, there is still a stigma surrounding mental illness. This can prevent young people from seeking help and support, which can worsen their symptoms. It's important to note that mental health issues are complex, and there is no single factor that can fully explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to depression than others. However, by recognizing and addressing the various social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to mental health issues, we can work towards creating a more supportive and compassionate society for young people."},{"instruction":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","output":"I think most of us are unhappy because our understanding of life is incomplete.

The probe is room temperature. Sticking the probe into the water changes the temperature of the water around the probe. So you literally cannot exactly measure the temperature of the water using the probe because doing so changes the temperature that you are trying to measure. It is a loose analogy. But it is close enough to explain what is meant by the whole mess. And it puts it into a macroscopic sense that you can wrap your brain around."},{"instruction":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","output":"Formulate a practical study plan based on your strengths, weaknesses, approx. weightage of topics & the time you have for preparation. In case you are weak in areas that carry very little weightage then you can either cover it at the very end or skip it. We recommend studying for at least 4 hours every day. You can spend 2 hours on core subjects, 1 hour each on engineering mathematics & general aptitude. Attempt mock tests/previous year papers in the last 3-4 weeks. The figures mentioned below are based on previous year papers & are subject to change Pro-tips: Cement your understanding of a topic or concept by solving questions of all possible types based on it immediately after learning it.Spend the last 4-5 mins in the GATE exam guessing answers of the numerical value based problems that you aren’t able to solve. Don’t skip these questions since there is no negative marking.Quantitative Aptitude & mathematics alone are worth 30 marks in the GATE exam and can be quite high scoring if you put in the effort. Refer to “Quantitative Aptitude for competitive examinations by R S Aggarwal” & previous year question papers. Irrespective of which branch you are from, Testbook can be your one-stop shop for everything GATE.

The exercise also gives the instructors insight into the candidate’s character. You can’t fail. You also can’t pass. Data could go through the exercise in the captain’s seat. He may, in fact, have done so. His performance in in real-life situations where catastrophe seemed certain shows that he performs quite smoothly in situations that would likely drive most humans to distraction.

At that point, why not dub it the “Ship of Theseus 2.0”? Now, if you reconstructed the original, that just becomes the 1.0 once again. Another route would be to follow the same path as above, but to never reach the “2.0” point, since technically, nothing about the ship is new in terms of dimensions, use, or features. Granted, if you replaced the parts with more durable wood (or a more durable material in general), I feel an argument could be made to change to “2.0.”"},{"instruction":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","output":"I think it's impossible to beat the will of this guy, not only did he willingly chose his fate but if you watch he does not move an inch as he burned to death !"},{"instruction":"What's the most ridiculous thing a coworker told on you to your boss for?","output":"I suppose it was when one of them told an internal news reporter I was living with my girlfriend who happened to be another elected official of the union I was heading.

The tone in which the question was asked, though, was so high and mighty and suggestive of some sort of secrecy or almost a ‘conspiracy to hide it’ type feeling, it has always stuck in my mind and made me laugh to recall it. It did get into the article that was published, though, as if anyone really cared. Oddly it came up again not long after when both of us were in a very tense meeting with our elected school board trustees and officials and I was trying to break the ice by chatting with my opposing negotiator from their team and said about one of our negotiations, ‘that was probably the most fun I ever had’ and my live-in down the table said, ‘I think I resent that.’ Every rolled on the floor laughing because it was still a ‘secret’ of sorts that no one felt they could mention (that we lived together), but the typical ‘spousal’ humor was exactly what it took to make the meeting go smoother thereafter.

Generally speaking, we don’t seem to put any value in Math. As technology advances continue to happen, I would think having an understanding of Mathematics is even more important. There is a huge spotlight on student success, and Math and English are the main targets. Why? Any degree you get requires Math and English. There has been this movement to remove barriers so students can advance and get their degree. In a California Community College, 70% of our courses were at the remedial level (Arithmetic, Pre-Algebra, etc). Nowadays, no more than 10% of our courses are at the remedial level. That’s a massive problem. The solution for more success is worse than the problem presented. The same thing is occurring in English as well. In Public Schools, they have the completely idiotic “No Child Left Behind” act. You can have a student fail Math since the 5th grade and then throw that person into Algebra 1. You have students who are completely prepared for Algebra 1, and you have students who can’t add two numbers together. That’s a recipe for a complete disaster. There are numerous things that I have massive problems with. Their definition of success is so warped. I had a student that began with Algebra 1. She ended up taking me for Calculus 3 and Differential Equations. She is an engineering major and VERY smart. She will get a degree and I have no doubt will have multiple job offers. We don’t highlight those successes. They do occur. At the community college, you can’t measure success by how many people go to a university. People go to a community college for a variety of reasons (enrichment, job training , etc). There is no “one size fits all” approach. It’s not reality, and I think administrators are trying to look for that."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"What Are the Best Ways to Invest Money? Hey there, fellow Quora readers! Today, I wanted to share my personal insights and experiences on the best ways to invest money. Investing is a fantastic way to grow your wealth and secure a better financial future. While it may seem overwhelming at first, there are several straightforward and effective investment options that can help you make the most of your hard-earned money. So, let's explore the best ways to invest money together! 1.Start with an Emergency Fund: Before diving into investments, it's crucial to set aside some money for emergencies. Building an emergency fund ensures that you have a safety net in case of unexpected expenses or financial hardships. Aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses in a separate savings account that is easily accessible. 2.Pay off High-Interest Debt: If you have any high-interest debts, such as credit card balances or personal loans, it's wise to prioritize paying them off before investing. This is because the interest you'll save from paying off debts is often higher than potential investment returns. By becoming debt-free, you'll have more disposable income available for investing. How Newbies Turn 20 Into 90,000 In 90 Days? (Not Crypto) Hey there! Forbes recently featured this astonishing software that has allowed thousands of everyday people turn 20 into over 100,000 in just 3 months… In fact, it is the same software that the top 1% of the hidden “elite” class of investors use to get returns of 150%, 500%, and even 10,000% sometimes within a few months or even weeks. The reason why this money making software is different from anything else out there is because unlike other systems, this one accurately predicts and filters out explosive stocks in the market before they explode. So you can buy stocks before they skyrocket in value from the very bottom, often for just pennies, and ride it all the way to the top! Without needing to read and study technical analysis… Without needing to look at fundamental analysis… Without paying some secret stock guru thousands of dollars to access it… [LINKED_TEXT: Check out hear] [URL: https://db7a258clck28ygbs2-2-2i8gs.hop.clickbank.net/] 3.Take Advantage of Retirement Accounts: One of the best ways to invest money is through retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). These accounts offer tax advantages and allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Contribute regularly to your retirement accounts, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. 4.Explore Index Funds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Index funds and ETFs are excellent investment options for beginners. These funds pool money from multiple investors and invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds that track a specific market index. They offer instant diversification, lower fees, and require less hands-on management compared to individual stock picking. 5.Consider Real Estate Investment: Real estate can be a profitable long-term investment option. You can invest in rental properties or real estate investment trusts (REITs). Rental properties provide rental income and the potential for property value appreciation over time. REITs, on the other hand, allow you to invest in real estate without directly owning properties. 6.Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key to managing risk and maximizing potential returns. Spread your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and even alternative investments like precious metals or cryptocurrencies. This helps protect your portfolio from the impact of a single investment's performance. 7.Stay Informed and Monitor Your Investments: Investing requires staying informed and keeping an eye on your investments. Stay updated on market trends, economic news, and any developments related to your investments. Regularly review your portfolio's performance and make adjustments as needed. However, avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Conclusion: In conclusion, the best ways to invest money include building an emergency fund, paying off high-interest debt, taking advantage of retirement accounts, exploring index funds or ETFs, considering real estate investments, diversifying your portfolio, and staying informed about your investments. Remember, investing is a long-term game, and patience is key. By following these strategies and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can potentially grow your wealth and achieve your financial goals. Best of luck on your investment journey!

The Steel Tariff reversed a strong (continuous) increase in export sales setting back steel sales by 10.8% The Aluminum tariff reverse caused a drop in sales of 3.9% These are seriously large drops in sales performance seriously impacting the producers and ultimately costing US consumers to pay more in construction material costs (as an example). The US imposed Tariffs put an extra 183 million dollars per month in the US duty collectors pocket during the tariff increase that was passed along to consumers (ultimately). What bothers me is the ease at which the president did it. This should be really of a concern to everyone in Canada. Trump displayed a complete lack of global economics and treated one of the USA’s biggest trading partners like a “less than” or unimportant x-partner. He was ready to economically damage Canadian Trade relations and the economy just to appease his political base. Be the “Big Man”. The result is now, at a fundamental level, Canadians no longer trust America. I see the USMCA (reboot of NAFTA) as something that is probably not worth the paper that it is printed on. If the President can invoke “War Measures” act to impose any tariff that he desires as a “punitive” measure then I think that Canada should be trying very very hard to find other trading partners to work with. Trading partners that value a relationship with Canada because the USA clearly does not.

Following are some good investment options that can be availed: [LINKED_TEXT: How to Make a Smart Investment Plan - 8 Simple Steps to Know] [URL: https://www.punditprofit.com/2023/05/building-strong-investment-plan.html] 1. LAND: An asset that does not depreciate over time.- For me, this is the safest bet for money investment and wealth creation in medium to long term to double your money or even much more. Infact, there is no limit to it.- However, this usually requires some good amount of research, field work, time consuming and legal work. Also, this is largely dependent on market valuation and has no fixed formula to evaluate.- Land sold within 3 years attracts a Short Term Capital Gain tax of 20% on profit, while 10% tax when sold after 3 years.- There are many websites now available which deal in real estate and plots buy/sell. One should purchase land/plots only from reputed dealers/companies and verify the legal documents from a legal expert.- A plot in the outskirts or along the highways/by pass roads, are good prospects and cheaper too. While any plot within the city would be already costly and might not appreciate further at a good rate.2. STOCKS or SHARES or EQUITIES: Probably the quickest way to grow wealth.- Investing in Stock Market is nothing but investing in the Company business and becoming its shareholder.- This is one of the easiest ways of investing money with a click of mouse using Demat Account. Totally transparent, hassle free and paperless process of transaction.- Biggest benefit is the profit is completely tax free if the investment is held for more than a year. Even the short term profit (Shares sold within a year) attracts only 15% STCG tax flat.- It can double your money in few years, months and even weeks.- A good company would also declare dividends (tax free) regularly and can issue share splits and bonuses which can increase your invested worth exponentially.- Also, every day one can get multiple opportunities to make profits via intraday trading as well.- Equity linked Mutual Funds, ULIPs, ELSS etc. are indirect ways of investing in the Share Market which can give you handsome returns if chosen wisely.- However, investing in Equities directly or through Mutual Funds is completely subject to market risks and hence requires at least some basic strategy mitigate risks. DEBT: This is the least risky investment option however cannot help your money grow at a fast pace. PPF (Public Provident Fund): One of the best debt investment options in long run. Not only Completely Tax Free but also a tax Saving investment under Section 80C. Money is locked for initial 7 years and cannot invest more than Rs. 1.5Lacs per year. However, serves as the best and safest wealth creation vehicle over years. After the maturity of 15 years, PPF can be renewed for another block of 5 years indefinitely. Fixed Deposits (FD): These are usually taxable and money is locked for the specific duration. It also usually attracts penalty if the money is withdrawn pre-maturely. Post Office Schemes: Like NSC, KVP, RD etc. However, the interest rates are not that high. Indian Post Offices are yet to catch up the online age, so not so favorite. ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) are good SIPs (Systematic Investment Plan):- Firstly its a Life Insurance Plan, the premium of which is invested in equity market, Hence, the return is never fixed and may be even negative if market has not performed well over the years of investment. Secondly, SIPs invest your money periodically (fixed dates) in the market irrespective of whether the market is at high or low. However, to reap best returns, the money should ideally be invested only when the market or share price is trading lower.

I was very excited at that time because I liked k-pop and was curious about how the students were studying there. Maybe my experience can help :D We left in the fall. The first impression is that the airport atmosphere is ordinary, quiet, not like the atmosphere when idols are welcomed home, which is so crowded that there is a photographer. Exiting the airport immediately felt really cold. I have never been to a cold country. Haha I was surprised when I first met my partner and her friends. Their make up is pretty thickSomething like this, but not all this 'natural'. Some have whiter faces than their necks, some have very red lipstick, wear eyeliner, and many use patches to cover their pimples. When I'm talking, I like to watch and think why the makeup is so thick plus the patch is a little strange in my eyes because no one in my house has worn it. I don't dare to ask the reason for wearing that thick makeup because I think it's impolite.Regarding the appearance of the students there, the girls are beautiful and tall, I don't pay much attention to the boys because I'm afraid (don't know why) but among Korean students who take student exchanges, the average is average, but 2-3 people are handsome and seem no plastic surgery, I don't know, I can't tell the difference :D. The height of the boys also varies, not all are tall, but some are very tall. The way they wear uniforms is also different. There are those who wear skirts and training pants at the same time and there are men who wear shirts that are not buttoned with them. Overall, South Korean students are like their TV dramas.Get ready for school at 06.00, 07.00Breakfast with small portions, actually I have a lot of appetite but at times I feel uncomfortable because they eat small portions, even though the food is delicious and I don't know why while I was there I was always served cold water.They don't shower in the morning, only wash their hair because they had bathed the night before (seems everyone already knows this)Most student families live in apartments and in car parks.I rarely see my partner's father at home in the morning, her mother often takes us to school.They are very cold. I, who already wore layered clothes and jackets, were still cold, but they only had short skirts, stockings, and jackets that looked comfortable.When we arrived, South Korean students came home early from school to accompany us to places of interest. I thought going home early meant it was noon but it was 06.00 PM. They just got home at that hour, they looked very happy. I can't imagine another student coming home later that night.If you want to enter the school building, you have to take off your shoes and replace them with sandals (I don't know if this is only done in certain seasons or not). So they each have their own slippers left at school.In my opinion, because they are more often at school, when they are outside of school they seem to want to be free. We were taken to places of entertainment such as bowling, billiards, karaoke. I personally want to go to a quiet place, but I can't protest either. Finally, I just enjoy it.My partner's family and friends are very kind. When we were at home, we were served Korean snacks such as Korean pancakes and when they greeted us, my friend's partner's father greeted us in another language, it was so funny that he used a translation with his voice.When they come home from school, they are rarely picked up. We sometimes take a taxi or bus home (if we take the bus, we are very tired because we have to walk again and in my opinion it is quite far but the good thing is that after that I am stronger than my other friends in my home country :D)Still about the points above, on the bus when it's crowded it feels very stuffy and the bus driver often wants to fall from his seatBecause I like to hear scary stories on the bus, I always cover my ass just in case.When I was on the bus, I often smelled a peculiar smell. Cannot be described.I've been seen by skinny men and he smiled so creepy that I was nervous. At first I thought maybe it wasn't me that he saw but after many times I looked at the father, he still had the same smile and kept looking at me. Luckily, it wasn't long before he came down. N-TThe tteokbokki there is very different from the one in my city. It's more delicious and tastes very very different.Every time I eat, there is always kimchi.Schools in South Korea are very large. At the school we attended, the boys' and girls' classes were separated. In these classes, it is very normal for students to wear hair rollers, blankets, mirrors, etc. when the teacher teaches.When at the coffee shop, Korean students don't like to talk or joke until their voices are loud.Walking in the middle of the night is normal for them.The toilet has a lot of weird buttons. I'm so confused just to flush :(I've been to a public toilet in a dining area and the inside door has used sanitary napkins on it. Oh man, it's the first time I've seen something like that… you can imagine how disgusted I wasThere was a Korean student who joined our activity and came late—we were playing billiards at the time—I didn't notice it at first, but my friend said that the Korean student's neck had red marks :D I thought maybe it was because it was night, mosquito bites. If it's true as expected, that's the first time I've seen T.T's hickey marks and it's weird...They—Korean students—are very good at taking photos. Actually there are many more but it will be very long. The school is not in Seoul. So, I don't know if in Seoul the student life is the same or not. I think you can draw your own conclusions about student life in Korea.

This resulted in his being afflicted with Cerebral Palsy which left Richard almost completely immobile and required care for the remainder of his life. Against the orders of doctors his father Rick chose to keep him at home and give him the best life he could. When Richard was 15 he asked his dad, Rick, if they could do a race to raise money for charity for an injured athlete from his school. He pushed his son in his chair for the entire race. His son ended up loving it, saying that while they raced he felt like he could walk for once in his life, that he felt alive. That was all that his father needed to hear. This began a long tradition of running races: Which included triathalons, in which Rick would put his son in a raft and pull him: Carrying him to different vehicles for transport. They have formed a legendary partnership that includes hundreds of races and 72 marathons. There is now a statue of the two in Boston: His father’s dedication to raising money and awareness for Cerebral Palsy, and above all, his dedication to bringing happiness to his son's life has always moved me.

So the prime minister gives him a list of knighthoods and he automatically approves it. Knights do not have to be citizens, but some countries frown on their citizens accepting honours from foreign countries, so the UK giving honours to non-citizens is relatively rare (eg., Amercian general Norman Schwartzkopf was given a knighthood for his role in commanding Operation Desert Storm). That being said, there are some orders of knighthood that are reserved for personal service to the king, and the king has discretion over who gets them. The government could in theory object to a knighthood being given to the king’s servants and advisors, but they will try to avoid interfering with that if at all possible."},{"instruction":"without using mathematical induction?","output":"I can prove the statement by factorisation as below.

So, i’ll list out some of the known and unknown facts one by one: Telugu language is a Dravidian language which ranks 3rd by the number of native speakers in India.‘Telugu’ might also be a reference to physical characteristics of the people who once lived there. Etymology: Andhra Bhasha — the language of the Andhras is known as Telugu, or Tenugu (tene/the-n = honey, agu = is), meaning, sweet as honey. The speakers of the language call it \\"Telugu\\". The older forms of the name include Teluṅgu, Tenuṅgu and Teliṅga. The etymology of Telugu is not certain. Some historical scholars have suggested a derivation from Sanskrit triliṅgam, as in Trilinga Desa, \\"the country of the three lingas\\". Another view holds that tenugu is derived from the Tamil and Kannada word ten– \\"south\\" to mean \\"the people who lived in the south/southern direction\\" in relation to the Indo-Aryan empires. But this etymology sounds absurd and meaningless, and the word “th-e’N” (not te-n) means Honey in Tamil; So this is the most correct etymology.Early Epigraphy: Prakrit Inscriptions with some Telugu words dating back to 400 BC to 100 BC have been discovered in Bhattiprolu in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. The English translation of one inscription reads, \\"gift of the slab by venerable Midikilayakha\\". This recent discovered inscriptions dating around 400–100 BCE actually was not a Telugu inscription. Dated between 200 BCE - 200 CE, a Prakrit work called Gāthā Saptaśatī written by Sathavahana King Hala, Telugu words like అత్త, వాలుంకి, పీలుఅ, పోట్టం, కిలించిఅః, అద్దాఏ, భోండీ, సరఅస్స, తుప్ప, ఫలహీ, వేంట, రుంప-రంప, మడహసరిఆ, వోడసుణఓ, సాఉలీ and తీరఏ have been used. The first inscription entirely in Telugu was made in 575 AD and was probably made by Renati Cholas, who started writing royal proclamations in Telugu instead of Sanskrit or Prakrits. Telugu developed as a poetical and literary language during the 11th century. This first written materials in the Telugu date from 575 AD and its script is derived from that of the 4th-century AD Chalukya dynasty and is related to that of the Kannada language. Telugu literature begins in the 11th century AD with a version of the Indian epic Mahabharata by the writer Nannaya. According to the famous Japanese Historian [LINKED_TEXT: Noboru Karashima] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noboru_Karashima] who once served as the President of the Epigraphical Society of India in 1985 calculated that there are approximately 10,000+ inscriptions which exist in the Telugu language as of the year 1996 making it one of the most densely inscribed languages. Telugu inscriptions are found in all the districts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are also found in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states in India. Bhujang Chenchiah [LINKED_TEXT: A History of Telugu Literature] [URL: https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xwXx7LB-ai4C&pg=PA17], Asian Educational Services, 1988 [Ref. [LINKED_TEXT: Telugu language - Wikiquote] [URL: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Telugu_language]]: “The view, maintained by all Telugu grammarians and Sanskrit Philogists, that Telugu is Vikriti — that is, a language formed by the modification of Sanskrit and Prakrit. An analysis of the language as it has ...been for centuries confirms this traditional view....” But the information does not enable to say whether they used Telugu in any form. It is probable that they spoke a form of Prakrit, from which Telugu has descended. Vikriti is the Proto-Telugu/Pre-Telugu spoken around 600 BCE–100 CE.Telugu was more influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit during this period, which corresponded to the advent of Telugu literature. Because of the continuous political dynamic empires like Mauryan, Satavanna and Pallavas have influenced their Prakrit, Sanskrit and Old Tamil on Vikriti, thus OLD TELUGU was completely formed well around 3rd century AD.Although many Sanskrit words are used in Telugu, yet the language has not its origin in Sanskrit.Pure Telugu is formed from roots, which have a close connection with the roots of the other languages of South India, e.g., Tamil, Kannada, etc.The Vijayanagar Empire gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its Golden Age. The bulk of Telugu literature belongs to the 14th and subsequent centuries. In the beginning of the 16th century the court of King Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar was famous for its learning, and various branches of literature were eagerly cultivated. The poet Vemana is supposed by some authorities to have lived during the 16th century.The Telugu Grammar is called vyākaranam (వ్యాకరణం). The first treatise on Telugu grammar, the Āndhra Śabda Cinṭāmaṇi, was written in Sanskrit by Nannayya, considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 11th century AD. Every Telugu grammatical rule is derived from Pāṇinian concepts.Sanskrit influenced Telugu of Andhra and Telangana regions for about 1500 years; however, there is evidence that suggests an older influence. During the period 1000–1100 AD, Nannaya's re-writing of the Mahābhārata in Telugu (మహాభారతము) re-established its use, and it dominated over the royal language, Sanskrit. Telugu absorbed tatsamas from Sanskrit.Modern Telugu vocabulary can be said to constitute a diglossia because the formal, standardised version of the language is either lexically Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, is taught in schools, and is used by the government and Hindu religious institutions.Everyday Telugu varies depending upon region and social status. The Telugu language, like many others, may be viewed as consisting of three branches, namely— (1) The language of common conversation, (2) The language of prose books, and (3) The language of Poetry. Each of these three branches differs not only in the choice of words, but also in grammatical forms of the same words.Telugu words end in vowels which many consider a mellifluous quality and thus suitable for musical expression. So most songs (Kirtanas) are in Kannada and Telugu, specifically ! Historicity of Telugu language: Among the four major Dravidian Languages, Tamil and Telugu had independent Origins: [LINKED_TEXT: History and Development of the four Major Dravidian Languages] [URL: https://languages361.quora.com/History-and-Development-of-the-four-Major-Dravidian-Languages]Bhujang Chenchiah [LINKED_TEXT: A History of Telugu Literature] [URL: https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xwXx7LB-ai4C&pg=PA17], Asian Educational Services, 1988: ...the view, maintained by all Telugu grammarians and Sanskrit philologists, that Telugu is Vikriti — that is, a language formed by the modification of Sanskrit and Prakrit. An analysis of the language as it has ...been for centuries confirms this traditional view....But the information does not enable to say whether they used Telugu in any form. It is probable that they spoke a form of Prakrit, from which Telugu has descended. (Page-16)Steever, Sanford B. (1998), \\"Introduction to the Dravidian Languages\\", in Steever, Sanford B., The Dravidian Languages, Routledge, pp. 1–39 explains clearly why Telugu was a Prakrit in its initial phase. Even Proto-Telugu (Vikriti) is supposed to be more ancient than Magadhi prakrit. Is Telugu, a Dravidian or Indo-aryan language ? Telugu language in its initial phase Proto-Telugu (Vikriti) was spoken in Asaka Jannapadha. And around 400 BCE after the fall of Asaka Jannaphada, Andhra empire was established under Satavannas (vassals of Mauryan Empire) who spoke Maharastri Prakrit. And after the fall of Mauryan empire, Satavannas are well known for having established trade links with north and south. They’re credited for establishing the vedic culture to the South. During these phases of History, Vikriti and other Prakrits influence over Dravidian languages gave Telugu, a high balanced Dravidian and Indo-aryan substratum. That is the reason why Telugu is still debated about its linguistic family identity. Telugu may be a Dravida bhasha or Arya bhasha (neither dravidian nor indo-aryan, but never anyone). Linguistically, Telugu is said to split from Proto-Dravidian at first. I would say Tamil is both phonologically and morphologically more close to Proto-Dravidian while, Telugu is morphologically closer to Proto-Dravidian. In terms of number of contrasting sounds, Tamil retains a considerable amount of Proto-Dravidian cognates and phonological system, while Telugu retains Proto-Dravidian gender system alone. Because of these similarities in morphological features, Telugu is often confused to be emerged from Tamil. But anyway Historical Linguistics says that Telugu in its initial phase was Prakrit which in due course of time evolved as a Dravida bhasha. That is the reason why early Epigraphic records found in Telangana and Andra are in Prakrit. Telugu is a continuation of Prakrit, during its historic phases unlike Tamil country, Telugu land suffered from Numerous invasions. Because of all these, Telugu language got distanced away from its Prakritic legacy. Other Dravidian languages may also have influenced Telugu language during its historic phases. Vedic basha → Vikriti basha (Pre-Proto-Telugu)→ Maharastri prakrit (Proto-Telugu) → Old Telugu → Middle Telugu → Modern Telugu.

Other Facts: Telugu is one of the six classical languages of India.Telugu has kept certain unique Sanskrit features, especially in the pronunciation of some vowels and consonants, that have subsequently been lost in some of Sanskrit’s daughter languages, including Hindi and Bengali.Telugu is ranked 7th in Asia and 14th in the world based on its total number of speakers.The only Indian language where every word ends in Vowel, so it is also called as ‘Ajanta Bhaasha’ and is called “The Italian of the East” by Niccola da Conti, a 16th century Venetian traveler.Telugu language is the 2nd heavily Sanskritized (close to 60%) Dravidian language next to Malayalam.Language of literary Telugu (Grandhika or Sampradayika) is very refined from its spoken form.Historically, the period from 11th to 16th century is known as ‘The Golden age of Telugu literature’.Emperor Krishnadevaraya himself was a Great Telugu scholar. He is the author of ‘Amuktamalyada’, one of the best Pancha Kavyas or five classic works.Telugu is an inflected language (modifying root words for case, number, and tense).

So, basically you get your gift halfway through Christmas dinner but just stare at it as you finish the second half of your meal. It’s weird but we do it and it’s kind of fun to see how the kids with impatient for their gift. It does something as it makes the kids more patient as they grow into an adult. It definitely helps me in my adult years with impulsivities and instant gratification. Anyways, 4 years ago, a family friend that we invited to dinner (because why not) legitimately gave my cousin (who married without kids) a pack of condoms “for good luck”. It really shook me. When we opened it after dinner, he just opened a box of trojans slim fit skyn. She gave it to him with the straightest face and said, “get to work, good luck”. I don’t know if I consider as much strange as unnecessarily out of place and perhaps disrespectful. Needless to say, we never invited the aforementioned person to family dinner again although we are now distant family-friends. Like, why would you do that, I don’t know why a person would. It did, though, promote..."},{"instruction":"it illegal to sell a book illustrated with a style meant to look like the drawing style used in a copywrited work (comment included)?","output":"I'm not a lawyer but (long description here) Using another art style in general is a bit of a case by case basis, but as an artist I find the best way to ask of it's safe to use is: How infuencial is this art style on other works and what traits appear in unrelated works of art? This can vary wildly depending on the copyright holder. Most cartoons, both western cartoons and anime tend to follow trends by the decade, these traits seen in multiple works are usually going to be considered \\"stock assets\\" and non copyrightable. So look for decade wide trends. Issues come in when someone heavily draws from an art style not seen elsewhere, as if other large companies aren't copying parts of it, it's definitely dangerous ground for an individual. Ever wonder why nobody draws and sells stuff in Dr Seuss' style? But multiple people seem to have an art style in their commercial portfolio similar to Jhonen Vasquez? It's probably because one is generally safe to use and draw influence from and the other isn't. It's not letting me see the comment (stupid app), so I don't know which work specifically by Hasbro you're influenced by- but I'd say if it's one such as Friendship is Magic or Transformers- don't bother, that's dangerous territory. You're asking for legal trouble since the style is dependent on the design and worldbuilding of the characters (in these cases them being cute ponies/vehicle-humanoid robots in universes revolving around such beings). At best you'll be scoffed as a knockoff and at worst you'll get a cease and desist. Or, you could do what D&D (owned by wizards of the coast and therefore Hasbro) did and do the halfling/Hobbit thing, but that is an issue of its own, and it even cost Hasbro a lawsuit in the beginning. Also do be noted that a style of drawing is *NOT* copyrightable as is a specific book, character, setting, film, or image. However of course, one can be sued for anything and large companies have an advantage (money, resources and money) over individuals. So you'll get sued if someone gets angry anyway. And if someone does sue you, an individual, even if you're fully in the right and win you'll have lost lots of money and time that could be spent advertising and selling your product.

But in 2016, Kaepernick ignited a firestorm of controversy when—as a protest against ongoing police brutality and racial injustice in the US—he chose to take a knee during the performance of the US National Anthem prior to pro football games. Criticized by then-candidate Trump, ostracized by Fox News and conservative pundits, and blackballed by the team owners, Kaepernick’s talents were not enough to get him contracts for the ensuing years, at times when players with far inferior records were getting signed.

Maybe, it could be favourable for her and her fake and blind supporters. As a Chief Minister, she has been an utter failure. Only thing she did was to appose DMK blindly or dismiss and rename DMK government’s projects and proposals. Even after her demise, her party (ADMK) is only a functionless body with MLAs who are now looking for another Master (Mr. Mo) who will keep them as slaves of money- just like how Jayalalitha maintained them. BJP wouldn’t have had any voice in Tamil Nadu if any other party, say DMK, had been in the governance. Jayalalitha is the major reason for the existing sickening plight of the people and the state of Tamil Nadu. Many issues are still left unaddressed which include farmers issue, unemployment, water scarcity in delta region, private sector encroachment, misuse of power of bureaucracy, and the list gets bigger. All these issues were in peak during Jayalalitha’s governance.

This is something similar. Whenever you try to access a website, you have to put in a request first. But that request exposes your public IP address that maybe you don’t want to do. It’s better to be safe and not expose your real IP address. This is where a Proxy server helps. When using a proxy server you would not access the website directly, but the proxy server will do it for you. Not just that it will also retrieve data for you. Is that all to a proxy server? No. There are many advantages to using a proxy server. These advantages include: Privacy: This is self-explanatory as to why it favours privacy.Speed: The proxy server may have Cached Web Database.Saves Bandwidth: Not retrieving the data from the original server would save bandwidth.Activity logging: Setting up your proxy server would help keep track of the websites visited.

Women have been having babies for thousands of years. It's the most important part of nature. Animals have pregnancy and give birth. So why are you guys acting like it's an unnatural thing to have a baby? Our bodies are designed for this stuff. We’re physically and mentally and spiritually designed for procreation. And we're not supposed to be sliced and cut up like the way they do. That's the hospitals and doctors making birth so unnatural. Not mother nature. So why is it that hundreds and thousands of women are being told that their bodies can't handle having a baby? Do you think doctors tell you the whole truth about your baby and your health? Not always. Doctors will ask anyone to have an abortion. They asked my mom and there was nothing wrong with all 5 of her children. And this was back in the 70’s and 80’s. If doctors really want to, they will lie about the wellbeing of mother and child to get an abortion procedure. But that doesn't mean that these health risks is true for all the thousands and millions of women in the world. A couple hundred women maybe but… Millions?? 🤔 There's so many stories and comments of women online who talk about their pregnancies and how the doctor told them that if they didn't terminate the pregnancy, their lives would be at risk and the baby will die anyway.

Abortion rights, women's rights.have been pounded and ingrained into people's minds for 50 years. So yes, of course men (and just about any person on the planet) will agree with the women. It's their bodies. Their rights. But with that said, it's funny how, when a mother abandons, or kills her newborn, or 2 month old baby, or 1 year old child. Why is she a monster? A murderer. A horrible woman. But not a real mother. What if she tried to have an abortion and her father, boyfriend, rapist, etc. Wouldn't let her? Why is she so horrible then? That baby was her right. Part of her body. Can someone please explain the difference?"},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","output":"If 1 USD=1 INR, result=Everyone Dies™ (in a way) Let's get one misconception out of the way: the strength of a currency relative to other currencies does not determine the health of that country's economy. If that were the case, Oman should be eclipsing the US and China as the most dominant economic force on the planet: that is, of course, not the case. With that out of the way, let's analyze what would happen to the Indian economy if the IN₹ matched the US in value. First off, as would be obvious, India's IT sector, which relies on inexpensive yet skilled labor would instantaneously collapse, leaving hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, out of a job. No job=no income, and India doesn't really have an extensive and strong safety net that other Western welfare states have, leaving many professionals almost penniless. As with the IT industry, other Indian exporters would also be completely unable to sell their products because of the loss of their competitive edge. But wait, that's not all! Due to the existence of what's known as the multiplier effect in economies, wherein effects of a particular decision can snowball into other sectors and produce effects on the entire economy, i.e. the decision's effects get multiplied throughout the economy. When all of the above takes place, people see a huge loss in demand, as so many people simply lose their disposable incomes, and are left with little money to spare. Businesses, having gone down under and shutting, lead their clients to suffer, and their creditors looking for ways to get their money back, and when they find that they can't, they also go bankrupt. They lose any purchasing power. But let's leave all these guys out of the picture for now, and focus on day-to-day aspects, that would concern most of us. Let's say that lots of us are able to survive on savings somehow. We find that imports are suddenly a lot cheaper than they used to be, especially American ones. American products get really inexpensive from an importing point of view, and we start buying American imports en masse. Whichever few Indian businesses would be left surviving would be driven to the point of extinction, even the ones that didn't rely on export income. Result: they shut shop too, and even more people lose their jobs. Now, we've spoken a lot about the Indian populace at large, but what about the government? Well, the government derives most of its revenues through taxes, and to an extent through the money earned from the public sector. When people find themselves without any money, all of the government's revenue streams dry up very quickly, and either they cut back their spending, or they start borrowing very heavily from other countries so that they can spend. If you're wondering which option is better, the answer is neither. Both options are absolutely terrible. If the government stops spending, literally everything and everybody suffers: defense (our neighbors would be quick to exploit this vulnerability), businesses that rely on subsidies, farmers, the common man, infrastructure companies, foreign multinationals seeking to expand into the country, banks, basically literally everyone. The other alternative? As torturous. We'd find ourselves in a position like Greece: unable to pay back the debt and interest, so we need to be bailed out by an organization like the IMF in return, most likely, for implementation of austerity reforms, crucifying the economy even further, killing incomes, and leading to a prolonged slump that would be extremely difficult indeed, to overcome. Therefore, if this happened, India would find itself in such a tough spot, that it would be extremely hard for it to climb out of. And, like I said before, Everyone Dies™."},{"instruction":"w many gun owners have actually stopped a crime from being committed by using a gun?","output":"Roughly 3 million times annually.

It was first done during the Tetrarchy. To answer your question anyway: by this time, Rome was more than just a city. It was an empire. Everyone who had citizenship of this empire was a Roman. So, when Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople, he didn’t need to change the name of the empire to ‘The Constantinoplian Empire' or something like that. Constantinople was Rome, not as in part of the city, but part of the empire.

This phrase is often used to remind people that they should be open-minded and take the time to get to know someone or something before making a judgment. To illustrate this point, let's consider a case study. Imagine that you are in charge of hiring a new employee for your company. You receive two resumes from candidates who have similar qualifications and experience. However, one of the candidates has a more polished and professional-looking resume, while the other candidate's resume appears to be hastily put together and contains some typos. At first glance, you might be inclined to choose the candidate with the more impressive-looking resume. However, if you take the time to read through both resumes and conduct interviews with each candidate, you might discover that the candidate with the less polished resume is actually a better fit for the job. Perhaps this candidate has more relevant experience, better communication skills, or a better attitude. In this case, judging the candidates based solely on their resumes would be a mistake. By taking the time to get to know each candidate, you can make a more informed decision and choose the candidate who is truly the best fit for the job. This example shows that it is important to look beyond appearances and take the time to gather more information before making a judgment. By doing so, you can avoid making hasty decisions that may not be in your best interest."},{"instruction":"it safe to give cats raw eggs or parts of raw eggs?","output":"I do know people that add an egg to the cats food once in awhile.

Equalization basins are a specialized process for the purpose of equalizing widely divergent flows. If a facility has normal diurnal flows (higher during the day and lower at night when people are mostly sleeping) then normal treatment processes can handle this. A plant like this doesn't really need equalization. On the other hand, if the flows to your facility increase dramatically and quickly, equalization is your best friend. For example, I worked at [LINKED_TEXT: Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Submarine_Base_Kings_Bay?wprov=sfla1]. There were two treatment plants there, one for the main base and one for the waterfront. The waterfront plant treated waste almost entirely from submarines and ships. As long as the boats were moored to the pier, we got normal diurnal flows. But when boats first dock they flush their tanks into our system. Depending on the circumstances of their trip, they may pump a day's worth of sewage in an hour. If several boats come in on the same day, that's a lot of sewage. Like anything else, sewage plants can be good designs or can be poor designs. This plant was a poor design. But the equalization basin was its saving grace. The plant had virtually zero flow changes, not even the normal diurnal flows. Stability of flow through a treatment facility is very helpful especially for poor designs so this plant generally did okay. As you can see, equalization basins can be very helpful in some circumstances. Even so, in most cases they just aren't needed. Most treatment plants do just fine without one."},{"instruction":"Do expensive guitar pickups make a difference?","output":"Yes, from a pure sonic perspective, the pickups are the most important component."},{"instruction":"w should I meet you?","output":"I travel a lot; maybe I’ll bump into you sometime.

I never owned one, but I had a cool experience with a bunch of them. Many years ago when I had to go work in Alaska for a couple months and I paid the guy who came in second that year in the Iditarod race to let me drive his dog sled and team up the Iditarod trail. When I drove up the dogs were on chains staked to the ground and they were straining so hard to start running. He explained that the main job was to keep them from running too fast and tiring themselves out. He sat in the sled to tell me what to do. Having seen movies where the musher just napped as he drove, I thought I did not need to do much and let the dogs just go. Whenever they had to urinate or defecate he would yell “on the run, on the run” and they would go while running 25 mph and he would have to hold his hand up in front of his face as it was flying back at 25 mph. When the trail hit a frozen lake, the dogs knew to turn toward the red flags marking the continuation of the trial on the left side of the lake so they turned left so fast the sled tipped over and the owner went sliding across the ice so I had to figure out how to stop them. When he got back to the sled he said “I’ll take over driving now, you sit in the sled and take a ride.” Knowing about the “on the run” I said “no way, I am paying to drive not ride, you sit up there, I’ll pay better attention.” We went maybe 30 more miles before we were blocked by a huge dead moose spread across the trail. Soon two rangers on snow mobiles arrived and started chain sawing it into manageable chunks and then carrying the chunks out on their snow mobiles. They told me that in the Spring (which it was then) when the moose have their babies, moose get very hostile when they see wolves and will charge the wolves and sometimes they find five or six wolves with parts of their heads sliced off. They said the moose half razor sharp edges on their hooves to cut through the ice to get to grass etc to eat, and when they swing their hooves out at wolves, if they catch the wolf’s head, it will just slice right through it. They explained when the moose see a dog team they think it is wolves and they charge. The dog team owners eat and sleep with their dogs and think of them like their kids, so when the moose charges, the owner has to shoot the moose. They then report the kill to the rangers who then remove the moose."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy in a real crisis?","output":"The Indian economy has been low since last five quarters and will continue , in coming couple of quarters or more. The major factor of the slowdown is decrease in demand. It can be seen in various sectors either automobile,food industry,real estate etc. The Indian population has around 75% rural indians. The demonitization and heckling implementation of GST, lead to shutdown of many small scale businesses.Small sector units mainly have labour force from rural areas. eventually, after these events the most of the rural indian people became unemployed. If these people do not have money to spend except on their basic necessities, then how the demand going to increase. The demand and supply go hand in hand , there should be a proper balance of the same. The rural people needs to be empowered in order to increase the demands. Small sector units needs to be revived. GST process needs to be made simpler. These are some of the structural reform that are needed to be done. Other structral reforms, Export is currently at 2.2% ,can be stretched upto 3% by facilitating the process.The foreign investment could be brought in by taking the confidence of investor. Reduction in corporate taxes is a great step.Women labour force decreased by 10% , last year from 33.4% to 22%. By waiving the income tax for working women for a period of 10–15 yrs could solve the above problem.MNREGA needs to be re- established ,re-indexed in order to empower rural people. The above steps are given by taking the consideration of rural people, which really are important factor in determining the GDP.

Proxy is divided into forward proxy and reverse proxy. We usually use forward proxy, which allows a network terminal (usually a client) to connect indirectly to another network terminal (usually a server) through it. Proxy can be divided into HTTP, HTTP over TLS (HTTPS), Socks, Socks over TLS according to the protocol. Their operation principle is to allow users to send data to a proxy server (Proxy Server) first, then the proxy server forwards it to the destination server, achieving the purpose of anonymous access. Using a proxy does not require the installation of a specific client. You can set the proxy address and port directly in the browser or app to create a connection to the proxy server. After the connection is successful, the proxy server will use the proxy protocol to send a connection request to the target network address or server resource. Although you can hide the user's real IP address through using a proxy, due to the difference in the type and protocol of the proxy used, your behavior data will not be encrypted and protected, but will also be saved as a log by the proxy service provider, which has a high potential security risk. Some agency service providers would also display their own advertisements, which adversely impacts the user experience."},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"Here are some things that are generally considered to be unwise or harmful in life: Procrastination: Putting off tasks or avoiding responsibilities can lead to stress, decreased productivity, and missed opportunities.Negative self-talk: Constantly criticizing yourself or engaging in negative self-talk can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.Substance abuse: Using drugs or alcohol to cope with problems or as a form of recreation can lead to physical and mental health problems, as well as relationship difficulties and financial difficulties.Avoiding personal growth: Refusing to challenge yourself or learn new things can lead to stagnation and a lack of fulfillment in life.Ignoring physical health: Neglecting exercise, sleep, or a healthy diet can have a negative impact on your physical and mental well-being.Toxic relationships: Surrounding yourself with people who are emotionally or physically harmful can be damaging to your mental and physical health, as well as your self-esteem.Procrastinating important tasks: Putting off important tasks such as paying bills, scheduling medical appointments, or completing work projects can have negative consequences.

However, here are some general tips that may help alleviate lower back pain: 1. Rest and Activity Modification: While rest is important during the acute phase of pain, prolonged bed rest is generally not recommended. Instead, try to stay active within your pain limits. Modify your activities and avoid excessive bending, lifting, or twisting that may strain your back. 2. Apply Heat or Cold: Applying heat or cold therapy to the affected area can provide temporary relief. Experiment with heat packs, warm showers, or hot water bottles for muscle relaxation. Alternatively, try ice packs or cold compresses to reduce inflammation. Choose the option that feels most soothing for you. 3. Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: Non-prescription pain medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. However, consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication, especially if you have other health conditions or are taking other medications. 4. Gentle Stretching and Exercise: Engage in gentle stretching exercises that target the muscles of the lower back, hips, and hamstrings. Consult with a physical therapist or healthcare professional for appropriate exercises to improve flexibility and strengthen the supporting muscles in your back. 5. Maintain Good Posture: Practice good posture during daily activities to reduce strain on your lower back. Use ergonomic chairs, support cushions, or lumbar rolls to maintain proper spinal alignment while sitting. Avoid prolonged periods of slouching or sitting in one position. 6. Stress Reduction: Psychological and emotional stress can contribute to back pain. Engage in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or hobbies that help you relax and unwind. 7. Seek Professional Help: If your lower back pain persists or worsens despite self-care measures, it's advisable to seek professional help. Consult with a healthcare professional, such as a physician or physical therapist, who can evaluate your specific condition, provide a proper diagnosis, and recommend appropriate treatment options. Remember, these are general tips and may not address the specific cause of your lower back pain. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized evaluation and treatment plan."},{"instruction":"Why am I always rejected by the men I am interested in?","output":"We are always attracted to those who are more attractive than ourselves.

No fault of their own, and mostly the fault of government. c) Student loans were taken out VOLUNTARILY by people with the OBLIGATION to pay them back. If the student majored in a field that has no career path, like 15th Century African Gender Studies, that’s their own fault.

I have been trying, but I can't learn any dance. I mainly want to learn hip hop and Kpop dances.","output":"1) Find a dance studio near you that has qualified teachers that know what they are doing. Starting at a good dance studio is very important as your basics and how you learn things will affect your future as a dancer. 2) Decide if you want to dance for fun or for competitions. This will determine how about how many classes you will take in a week and fees/tuition. Usually recreation classes only require you to take one or two classes a week. Competitive dancers usually take four, five, or six classes or one every day. All of this depends on your end goal, to get fit or have some fun or to win awards and scholarships. 3) Pick your dance genres. There are many dance genres to choose from. The most mainstream styles are ballet, contemporary, modern, lyrical, jazz, tap, and acro. Research about these genres and see which one you want to take. I would definitely recommend some form of ballet as ballet is a basis for all dance genres. Once you pick your genres then choose your classes. Call your studio to find classes that fit your genre(s) and time. Most studios have a free class you can take or a free trial week so you can make sure of your decisions before paying. 4) What to wear. Once you’ve paid your fees, you’re almost ready to dance. Now what do you wear to dance classes? Always make sure you are within your studios dress code if there is one! Ballet- Leotard and tights with ballet slippers of you or your studios choice. Contemporary/Modern/Lyrical- Anything that is relatively form fitting and comfortable to dance in. For shoes, dance socks, half soles/turners, foot undies, anything that your feel comfortable to dance in. Tap- your studio might give you a specific tap show to buy or you can choose for yourself. Clothing varies. Jazz- jazz shoes/ turners and clothing may vary. Make sure your hair is away from your face so you can dance comfortably and pull your hair into a bun in ballet for a clean look. Lastly, always remember to have fun! The last thing you want is too be to stiff. Don’t be afraid to express yourself through your movements."},{"instruction":"f the Avengers Hulk fought King Kong, who would win?","output":"Hulk, easily. Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"instruction":"The Mahabhar","output":"Krishna was not only skilled in war strategy but he was also a mighty warrior. But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma’s reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There’s no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could.

I have consumed 2 hours everyday from last 3–4 days for writing this answer. To answer your question in short, Arjuna was the most powerful warrior except Shri Krishna and Shri Balarama Ji.

How do I and/or where do I go to get started?","output":"🌟 If you have 100k to invest passively, here's a step-by-step guide to get started: Assess Your Financial Situation: Before investing, review your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Determine whether this 100k is money you can afford to invest without affecting your essential needs.Emergency Fund: Ensure you have an emergency fund with enough savings to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund acts as a safety net in case of unexpected expenses.Pay Off High-Interest Debt: If you have high-interest debt (such as credit card debt), consider paying it off first. The interest rates on these debts are usually higher than potential investment returns.Diversification Strategy: Divide your 100k into different investment vehicles to spread risk. A common rule of thumb is to allocate across stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and goals.Brokerage Account or Financial Advisor: Choose whether you want to manage your investments directly using a brokerage account or work with a financial advisor. If you're new to investing, a financial advisor can provide guidance.Select Investments: Depending on your risk tolerance, consider a mix of index funds, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), mutual funds, and possibly individual stocks or bonds.Robo-Advisors: Consider using robo-advisors. These automated platforms create and manage a diversified portfolio for you based on your risk profile and goals.Real Estate Crowdfunding: Look into real estate crowdfunding platforms that allow you to invest in properties with lower entry points. This can provide exposure to the real estate market without direct ownership.Dividend Stocks: Consider adding dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio for a consistent income stream.Review and Adjust: Regularly review your portfolio's performance and adjust your allocations if needed. Rebalancing ensures your portfolio stays in line with your original goals.Tax Efficiency: Be mindful of tax implications. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) to minimize tax liability.Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated about market trends and developments. However, avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations.Long-Term Mindset: Remember that investing is a long-term endeavor. Avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market movements.Continual Learning: Invest time in learning more about investing. Knowledge is your best tool for making informed decisions.Professional Advice: If you're uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals. Investing 100k is a significant decision.

The astral body is free from gravity just like a fire flame is free from gravity if you light a candle and put it upside down candle flame will still try to go upward. Basically, the astral body is made up of light and once you leave your astral body you can go as far as you want. But you are still connected via your navel from the Astral body to physical body with a shiny silver cord like substance. You can see your own physical body sitting in the same position when you started the AP but now your own self is flying because you have progressed the physical to the astral or light body. You can come back immediately if you think about coming back to your physical body there is no lapse. It is instant just like a thought. The astral body is weightless just like fire or light has no weight. Lucid dreaming is still inside the mind but also inside the body too. If you want to move in a lucid dream you can move your arm or leg and you can feel the sensation of movement but nowhere near AP. You have less control in lucid dreaming and there is no silver cord. You are attached fully to your own body’s each cell and if someone tries to wake you up you will lose the lucid dream state but in AP your body will completely be numb even a needle prick will not move you at all as your consciousness is completely out of your body. In AP your body’s all processes halt to its minimum even your breathing cannot be sensed & you can still be out of body for few days and body will not decay because needed nourishment is coming via silver cord but brain waves, if measured during AP, will come up at Delta level or lower or may not come up at all in certain cases because we do not have the machine or technology to catch or monitor beyond Delta. It is beyond human perception. Our bodies have very limited perception and limits. Our body only revolves around 20 degrees plus or minus. Our bodily temperature can only be between 90 degrees C or 110 degree C. That is too extreme on both ends so we can see our entire life is constricted within very limited degrees. Fire can go up to 1,500 °C or more a dazzling white kind of fire not red or yellow that are too soft. You can see here physical body is only limited to 10 -20 °C but fire can go beyond 1500°C and astral body is all made up of white bright light that is why when in cinema or movies they show out of the body, they always show very bright white simmering light without knowing why? Now you can imagine the power of Astral body what it is capable of doing with such power & light and Lucid dreaming still in the range of human body heat of 90 to 110 °C.

Not wanting to be the first to break the silence (and LOSE), he wrote on a piece of paper, \\"Please wake me at 5:00 AM .\\" He left it where he knew she would find it. The next morning, the man woke up, only to discover it was 9:00 AM and he had missed his flight.

The paper said, \\"It is 5:00 AM, Wake up.\\" :)))"},{"instruction":"the golden ratio overrepresented in popular media?","output":"Magical mystic thinking often goes bit ahead of strict science. Golden ratio on one hand has got into hands of artists and people of esoteric mentality, on another is not seen by hard scientists such as mathematicians, physicists, engineers etc. as of any significant value or usage. Thus, information on golden ratio is processed, multiplied and spread around by people who are too incompetent to apprehend its value properly in other than vague or mystical way, creating garbage knowledge that is obviously naive for people with at least a bit of scientific mindset. At the same time, the best of scientists cannot apprehend its value either, since its usage is too hard and current math apparatus is too cumbersome/static/primitive to handle complex oscillatory dynamics. Hence, not seeing what's invisible, they easily dismiss it, claiming with certainty that golden ratio is in fact worthless. So the answer would be, it's both overrepresented in wrong way in society/media, and heavily underrated in scientific communities. The possibly upcoming new era of biotechology, neuroengineering with new paradigms of less rough cybernetics and more wave-based bio-like phenomena as technology might change this completely (e.g. see [LINKED_TEXT: Who invented golden ratio?

I can’t think of an instance of a local I know, disrespecting an outsider for being from somewhere else. We have been cool to you. I have also seen many friends and family members move their own families far from the area, to places where the dollar goes farther.

The banks are in all cahoots in this. Do you remember when overdraft fee was only 7 on Monday and then it changed to 34 by Tuesday? All the banks did this together — on the same day. What a coincidence! This was back in 2005. But I can help you. The answer to your question doesn’t lie with with the banks but lies with the credit unions. The banks are mega profit-making machines. Credit unions are nonprofit. Are you OK with this? My credit union charges no fees for overdraft. They will charge you a 25 bounce check fee, but no fee overdrafts from the savings to the checking to pay for all your items, whether it’s one big item, or many small items: zero fees zilch! How does that sound to you? You can overdraft on gas charges, credit card purchases, there are no fees!

Yes there were some empires in the past whose territories occupied both countries territories in modern times, but how big were those empires? Srivijaya even at its peak only controlled Sumatra, Malaya, Western Java, and Western Borneo, while Eastern Java, Eastern Borneo, Celebes, Papua, Moluccas, and Nusa Tenggara were never under their control. Besides that there was Majapahit that only had tight control over its core territory which expanded from Eastern Java to Bali, other than that seems like they didn't really have actual control over lands in the other parts of the archipelago, Trowulan was quite satisfied with the new status of its conquered kingdoms as tributary-vassal states. Many people has mentioned about the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, saying the Europeans had divided Nusantara into two spheres of influence. However I think the treaty is overrated, people talk about it as if when the treaty was made, the archipelago was living under a single political entity, though the reality was we weren't united, there were lots of different kingdoms at that time. The treaty did divide a Sultanate which located in the Malacca strait, but a Johor-Riau Malay Sultanate was just a small part of Nusantara, it's so small compared to Indonesia's territory today. For certain ethnicities, the Europeans presence in the archipelago did make their people have to live in different countries today. Besides the treaty with the Dutch, the British also made a treaty with the Thai, and the legacy of it is the Malay have to live in Indonesia and Thailand as ethnic minorities. However for Indonesia as a nation, the Dutch presence in Nusantara wasn't a disaster, but a “blessing”, because they were here as our common enemy and their colonial lands were the basis of the Republic territories. If not for those Londo, I don't think the Balinese would like to live in the same country with the Minangkabau, so do the Batak and the Buginese, so do the Dayak and the Javanese, and so do 300 other ethnicities in Indonesia. There're many voices from Malaysia that promote a propaganda like “Indonesians and Malaysians are same people, same nation, same language, same culture, same religion, same race, same root, and etc.”, and surprisingly there're those among us who believing it. My questions to those Indonesians are : “Have you forgot our Youth Pledge? Do you forget that our republic has more than 700 languages and over 300 ethnicities? Do you remember that Jakarta officially recognize 6 religions as equal? Have you remembered our brothers and sisters from Eastern Indonesia?”. When an Indonesian says that his/her country is diverse, he/she isn't lying or joking. If Malaysians don't believe with the idea of Indonesia as a diverse nation, you guys could go to Bali or Jogja (the 2 most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia) and then observe the languages and cultures of the locals, from there you could go to anywhere in your country and do the same thing, after that you would understand, after all seeing is believing right? My answer to those voices from the Monarchy is simple : “Kami bangsa Indonesia! Bukan bangsa Melayu!” “We are the nation of Indonesia! Not the nation of Malay!” *I'm aware that there're ethnic Javanese who living in Malaysia as its citizens, but the big questions are : “Are they still Javanese and preserving Javanese language and culture in Malaysia? or have they became Malay by speaking Malay language and practicing Malay culture?” and “What has Kuala Lumpur done to protect Javanese language and culture in Malaysia? or is the government letting the Javanese assimilating and integrating themselves to the Malay?”. *I'm also aware that there're Malay Indonesians, yet in the country, Malay isn't a nation, but only an ethnic, the term nation in our context only refers to Indonesia."},{"instruction":"What did Jordan Belfort do in The Wolf of Wall Street that was illegal?","output":"high pressure sales tactic to sell stock.SEC made it illegal to pressure retail investors to buy stock"},{"instruction":"f Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?","output":"It doesn’t.

More Control You will have more control over power and speed, lets say you want to overtake some vehicle so you'll need sudden acceleration, and to achieve that you can down gear and get that but that is not the case with non geared because they are automatic and will always have linear acceleration. In some situations you need power eg when approaching an upland then you can switch into a lowered gear and do that eaisly. More suited for longer rides In addition to the the above advantages if you are comparing a scooter which generally are non geared with the bikes then the tire size plays a vital role by reducing the amount of jerks and have better suspensions too. They also are more stabe in higher speeds. Advantages of non Geared ones City commutes: These are more comfortable for city commutes as you dont have to bother about changing the gears and this makes a lot easier to ride in traffic. You have to hold the clutch again and again in traffic and that seriously hurts. Storage You will get a huge amount of storage in case of scooters which can hold a good amount of things which you cannot expect in bikes,even there is no option of keeping your smallest of wallets or specs.

The fundamental reason is that significant amounts of previously sequestered carbon and hydrocarbons are being brought to the surface, oxidized, and released to the atmosphere. This has already increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere to over 25% higher than it has been in over 8 thousand centuries. It is still rising fast with no limit in sight. Water vapor, on the other hand, is limited by the multiple feedback loops and the stabilizing effect of more than half of the surface of the Earth being covered by liquid water. The increase in water vapor in the atmosphere caused by global warming will be insignificant compared to the increase in the energy driving the weather. Some fossil water is being added to the active circulation from both the combustion of fossil fuel hydrocarbons and the pumping of water from deep aquifers at rates much faster than they are replenished. The percentage change will be insignificant.

And for the Cuman part, what is a Romanian? At the beginning it was a mix of people from before the Slavs, Slavs and, among others, Cumans. So even if he was partly Cuman he was still a Romanian. Now, I’m not very fond of him, unlike other of my co-nationals, in my opinion he was a very violent, brutal man, even for his time, but what’s really prevent me from being somehow appreciative (he lived in brutal times so his brutality should be judged accordingly) about him was his lack of strategical thinking. He was an excessive radical, alienating the nobles beyond forcing them into submission, transforming them into enemies.

It’s not easy to become a cyber-security expert, and to become one you need to start thinking like a security person. Unfortunately, universities do not teach how you do that, so you need to get some real-life experience and learn from the industry professionals. I believe that the art of building security solutions is not in the math neither in the algorithms, but mostly in the proper engineering and in the deep understanding of the possible threats you are addressing with your solution. To illustrate my point with cryptography, my approach will suggest that an industry standard asymmetric encryption will do the job, so we won’t develop our own proprietary encryption algorithms. Instead, the most architectural and engineering efforts will be spend on hiding and securing the cryptographic keys, establishing secure channels and authentication of the parties."},{"instruction":"Does any species exist which can’t thrive in captivity?","output":"The question is “Does any species exist which can’t thrive in capitivity?” Huge numbers of species don’t THRIVE in captivity.

This Could be a threat to many other companies like Amazon, Netflix, Fintech Startups (Phonepe, Paytm and GPay). Jio had spent 3 billion dollars to acquire dozens of Companies in last one year including Saavan, Haptik, Nowflots etc. Jio has more than 388 million users, which is highest among all Indian telecom companies. And Facebook was also desperate to make a big move in India but it had failed previously with Net neutrality. So by Investing in Jio, It could do what they wanted 3 years back. Jio has been working on a super app like WeChat and Indian apps like Paytm or Phonepe. Facebook sees plenty of opportunity with Jio. India is a large market for Facebook; more than 400 million people in the country use WhatsApp, its global messaging service, while more than 300 million people use the company’s core social network. WhatsApp has worked for years to build tools for small businesses and has dabbled in payment systems, while Facebook has also invested in creating digital storefronts for entrepreneurs to sell goods and services online. By bringing together JioMart, Jio’s small-business initiative, with WhatsApp, they can enable people to connect with businesses, shop and ultimately purchase products in a seamless mobile experience. More recently, Facebook has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over WhatsApp. The government has demanded that WhatsApp change its encryption to trace messages back to their source, which WhatsApp has refused to do. At the same time, regulators have repeatedly delayed WhatsApp’s request to offer a payments service to its Indian users. Ambani has also been the most powerful corporate voice urging regulators to take an India first approach that favours companies like Facebook and Amazon. But this partnership can bring life to Whatsapp pay in India. If it is true then Jio will enter in E-commerce and Media Industry using Jiomart and Jio Tv enabled by Whatsapp Pay. Which is the biggest threat to Amazon, they will become head to head competitors Because of Prime Videos and Amazon E-commerce. Jio has ambitions to take on Amazon in e-commerce, run data centres, provide fibre internet to homes and businesses and set up new services like telehealth and distance learning.

I provided some details about me. Someone please help a conflicted junior out?","output":"Nobody on this board, including any Harvard Admissions officers on this board, has the slightest clue. To quote Chris P. of the MIT admissions office when he answered the same question about MIT: Why? Because the factors of admissions that can be readily apprehended in a forum post (GPA, SAT scores, etc) are in many ways the least important in our process.Because listing the school you go to or ECAs you are involved in does not communicate the degree to which you are a vibrant member of the community, does not communicate what your coaches or teachers or mentors will say about you, and those are the things we care about.Because it does not include any information about the interview, which is another critical insight into the candidacy of any prospective applicant.Because a forums post cannot communicate the complexity of an applicant’s life story, circumstances, and so forth; even if they were to replicate all the answers to their essay questions, we still have additional data external to the application that we consider in understanding an applicant’s context.Because of a billion other reasons along the way. I fully understand that this is a stressful time. From my own time on Quora, on College Confidential, on the Student Room and similar fora, I know that people can take “what are my chances” questions very seriously. And I have seen this sorely abused. I have seen people roundly mocked for their accomplishments, often when I cannot see anything to mock in their accomplishments. I have seen these taken very badly, I have seen it affect where people apply. I have seen a wide variety of trolling both on the questioner (e.g. “I only have 3 Nobel prizes, can I still get in”) and on the responses (“what makes you think you can get in with only 3 Nobel prizes, don’t be an idiot”) and it is very destructive. Here is what you need to know right now:1) Do you want to go to Harvard?2) Can you afford the admissions fee to apply (and if not, Harvard offers a very generous fee waiver program)? That’s pretty much it. Apply. You might well get in. Last year, Harvard admitted 0% of those who did not apply. Be aware that the admissions is very competitive. Schools like Harvard are reach schools for everyone. The recent Harvard admissions lawsuit (which Harvard won), had the advantage of putting normally confidential Harvard admissions statistics into the public domain. In a recent admissions cycle (in which there are fewer than 2000 available places), more than 8000 domestic applicants had perfect GPA’s; over 3400 applicants had perfect math SAT scores and over 2700 had perfect Verbal SAT scores. Your stats are enough to make you a viable candidate. Beyond that nobody, including the admissions officers can say at this point. Good luck."},{"instruction":"Trump ordered the airstrike at BIAP to kill Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general. What do you think of this action? What are the consequences or how will this play out in the Middle East?","output":"In order to know what the action will be from Iran's end, it’s important to note the history between the US and Iran. In many respects, it has been focused on destabilization- meaning the countries have had animosity towards each other, but, in the case of Iran, there has been the avoidance of strictly getting into pure warfare. Let’s take this a step further and note an extremely important political event: The freeing of American Hostages upon Reagan’s election. This is extremely noteworthy not only because of the freeing of American hostages, but the reasoning as to why. At the time of this, the conflicts between the U.S and the Soviet Union were still fairly present. Apon electing a highly capitalistic US president, the cultural shift of the US at a time of extreme tension meant that, for an upcoming country like Iran, it was best to get out of the way from a new leader like Reagan- who’s temperament was unknown compared to the predecessor of Jimmy Carter. It acts on necessity. Now, let’s compare and contrast this to the positions of the US and Iran today. At this point in time, Donald Trump’s temperament is very well known, and it is Iran that is in a more destabilized position. Simply attending to the fact that Iran is now more destabilized and has an even greater ax to grind, it’s quick to come up to the assumption that Iran could try and begin forming violent conflicts with the U.S. But that’s not entirely the case. Let’s look at the other variables that are present: Iran is not as great of a powerhouse as it used to be in terms of oil manufacturing- and extremely high unemployment along with a currency value of 33333.33 Rial to 1 USD.They just lost someone who, in many respects, was a second-in-command of their state. This is a brutal shakeup when considering further destabilization of the country itself from a political standpoint, making it’s ruling more uncertain. He was a brutal fighting force for them, and his loss puts them at a much greater vulnerability.At the same time, the U.S is also politically shaken. The election in 2020 is incredibly pitting- meaning that the next leader of the country is too early to call, while at the same time, the country is notoriously divided within it’s parties. A soundable echo of the country won’t be backing greater war efforts within Iran.This also means any actions Iran takes right now will greatly affect their relations with the next leader of the US.U.S relations with China are already on thin ice as the country clearly begins to extend itself as a rival superpower, but it’s allegiance with Russia has also grown formidably tighter. Putin is clearly a tough leader, meaning that he is unlikely to act quickly unless these tensions affect Russia directly. This means, that until further notice, the superpowers likely to be involved are the U.S and China. However, under fighting forces in Hong Kong, China will be playing with fire with U.S forces under getting involved. There will be mostly seclusion from other countries until it directly affects them. That being said, what could this mean for conflicts with the US and Iran? Well, let’s begin by being clear about the positions- this would be a game of incredibly difficult offensive and defensive decisions on Iraq’s end- while the U.S’s tactics would be most intended under a more offensive strategy while securing general defensive strategies to deter further escalation. This is clear because, though tempered, Trump is not a war-president. He also cannot afford to further escalate conflicts with Iraq if he wants to continue rallying low commodity prices. If this begins to shift, it’s probably the indexes could begin to show further signs of panic- leading to a correction that would deter the index-fund hot-hoop strategy that most employers and investors use right now. Running into 2020, his best bet is the economy, not war. As a result, what we can predict from Iran will attempt to push U.S forces out- as a direct reaction that they can now explain, at a scale, they could not before. It’s likely Trump will continue to press on this issue- and there are two possible outcomes that form from this. A reaction from the Quds Force and it’s extreme reactivity towards this event will occur brutally inside of Baghdad- destabilizing the entire region and forcing national leaders to begin reacting and re-strategizing relationships with the Middle East. Iran will definitely begin facing further sanctions and could see a destabilizing revolt by citizens. The nation on it’s own will not react further, then focusing on defensive strategy. It will re-shape the country, but it’s effects will be seen most likely through the economy. You can begin to predict a surge of Quds potentially growing attacks and grow it reaches across the middle east, turning it into a political problem for whomever the incumbent president will be at the time. The Iran Nuclear deal will not be saved- and it will cause a panic in all countries- and thus, stabilization efforts from some countries, while others still poke. The US is likely to poke. If this continues to be a growing problem, it is possible at a later time, US forces may invade Iran under a Republican President after Trump.There will be independent attacks coming from INSIDERS in Quds force, demonstrations, and protests. The US will react minimally to these, and grow it’s a military base in quiet overtime to further prevent outbreaks. Iran will not react to any independent attacks, and those will continue as the region begins to further destabilize. Price hikes on imports are inevitable, and you can expect tariffs from the US to also expand as a result, but very slowly over time. Oil prices will be a problem for the next term. The Nuclear deal will not be saved, though there will be efforts to save it by mitigating the damage done. Other countries will take in greater benefits from their power and oil, and will force the US to try and re-open negotiations with Iran. These two broadly outline the reactions that will occur, as the attack is a destabilizing attempt, who effects will be played on extremely thin ice per attack so as not to break the defenses of Iran to the point in which it directly affects the US. Doing so will not bode well for any of the two countries. But the major note you’ll see here is conflict- because war will not be advisable for both countries. However, it will certainly become a problem for the U.S to find a way to deal with- as most destabilizing efforts can produce."},{"instruction":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","output":"A [LINKED_TEXT: Mobile App Development Company ] [URL: https://lbmsolutions.in/mobile-app-development-company/]specializes in creating tailored mobile apps for your business needs.

Why or why not?","output":"Yes, I believe in Karma. The way you deal your parents today, tomorrow your child will deal you. A farmer got so old that he couldn’t work the fields anymore. So he would spend the day just sitting on the porch. His son, still working the farm, would look up from time to time and see his father sitting there. “He’s of no use any more,” the son thought to himself, “he doesn’t do anything!” One day the son got so frustrated by this, that he built a wood coffin, dragged it over to the porch, and told his father to get in. Without saying anything, the father climbed inside. After closing the lid, the son dragged the coffin to the edge of the farm where there was a high cliff. As he approached the drop, he heard a light tapping on the lid from inside the coffin. He opened it up. Still lying there peacefully, the father looked up at his son. “I know you are going to throw me over the cliff, but before you do, may I suggest something?” “What is it?” replied the son. “Throw me over the cliff, if you like,” said the father, “but save this good wood coffin. Your children might need to use it.” Image Source : Google"},{"instruction":"it correct affirming, in the light of the Scriptures, that the woman who makes abortion does not believe in God?","output":"The Christian Bible is very clear.

If yes, then what is the equation?","output":"As Valdis rightfully mentioned in his answer, there are a few cranks who think they do. I happen to be one of those cranks. A theory of everything is not complicated at all. And a Theory of everything should literally and figuratively mean just that. As such it should not only but then especially so include consciousness as well. As for the equation which is nothing at all like the complicated formulations you would expect. For a theory of everything you only need to understand 3 things for what it really is. And that is Time, Space, and Energy and how the 3 interacts and being responsible for the Present Past and Future. And as a result of this you get two interlaced triangles which I like to refer to as Solomon's seal. The three corners of the one triangle represents Time, Space and Energy and the other interlaced triangle represents the Present, Past and Future. And when you get to understand how these two triangles represents everything then you can explain literally anything, even human behaviour. You can even explain how and why Einstein's theory of Special Relativity is 100 percent correct but all for the wrong reasons. Metaphorically speaking. If 2+2 gives you 4 and 4 being reprrsentative of special relativity. Then 1+3 also gives you 4 of which 4 once again represents Special Relativity. However there is a huge difference between 1+3 and that of 2+2 despite the outcome being exactly the same. And herein lies the very problem holding us back from discovering a Theory of Everything. It's like being on the right road but heading in the wrong direction hence East versus West. In both cases you would end up with the sun crossing the horizon. Only problem is the one direction leads you into darkness and the other will make you see the light of day."},{"instruction":"What do you think of the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemning the U.S. Capitol riot incited by Trump?","output":"He is simply saying out loud what the whole world watched in real time on Wednesday."},{"instruction":"w many seats will BJP win in Lok Sabha 2024? Give a prediction of how many seats BJP will gain in each state.","output":"The answer to this question is not simple one. It will depend upon many things. First, let us see how the opposition parties unite themselves. If somehow there is fight of one to one candidate as the opposition parties are saying then the BJP will be in trouble. However there are very few chances of this. Second thing is that how much benefit BJP takes from UCC. Thirdly, if it can bring Population bill or not. Fourth wether it gives some special benefits to farmers or not. Om the issue of employment this government is failure one. BJP'S core voters i.e. Middle Class is dissatisfied. Even then, in my opinion, NDA will loose some seats in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Madhay Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh in comparison to 2019 election. It will gain in Orissa, Telangana, West Bengal, and Tamilnadu. As a result BJP itself will get around 250 seats and NDA 300.

My personal opinion? There’s been a LOT of weird shit in the Smith family these last few years and every man has his breaking point. Jada’s “entanglements” caused Will to be basically publicly humiliated multiple times. This was really one of the biggest times when he had put the weird shit Jada was doing behind him and getting back his legendary status. I’d like to get my personal bias and opinion out of the way first. I am 100% in support of Chris on the matter. The joke didn’t have to be funny to you, I completely understand if it isn’t. But the facts are these Chris Rock didn’t even really make fun of Jada. He pointed out that she shaved her head like a movie and that was it. Didn’t say she looked bad or anything just made the joke. Which is VERY tame for a comedian at such a big eventJada herself posted a statement a while ago saying she just wanted to laugh about the condition. I said the same shit when I had to have tons of stomach surgeries and I didn’t want people to throw a fit because a joke was made at my expense when I publicly stated I wanted to laughThey saw that Chris Rock was going to be the host. If they wanted anything to be off limits to the degree that Will would assault him if it wasn’t off limits then they had plenty of time to clarify that with either Chris or the management. I expect anybody who is THAT touchy about a subject to take precautions instead of expecting a comedian to leave a very well known family alone. Even with all that I can understand Will taking action. If he had a problem with it he should have talked to Chris after the show or even yelled at Chris or roasted Chris from his seat. The LAST thing you wanna do as a very influential figure who kids look up to and who is accepting a reward for a film he believes is deeply important, is assault the guy who’s giving the award. This is especially true considering not even an hour later Will Smith would give a speech about how he wants to be an embodiment of love and just spread love and peace in the world I mean his apology which came out like an hour ago is still just briefly mentioning Chris and instead focused on the fans of the movie and the williams family It just felt like a lot of bad decisions stemming from his families myriad of drama these last few years"},{"instruction":"The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws.

Same day voting was going to heavily favor Republicans, as Trump had been urging supporters not to vote by mail. Mail-in voting was going to be massive in 2020, due to the pandemic, and that was going to heavily favor Democrats. Despite this, the President and those closest to him, were far inside their news bubble that they were in complete disbelief when returns shifted as the night went on.

This way you are still gonna decrease calories, but in a normal range to a point where you are comfortable to be at. let's say 2300.

Should I see a doctor for this or is this normal for fat people?","output":"It’s pretty normal to lose your stamina or cardio fitness if you’ve been sedentary for over two years AND become obese. So, you just need to readjust your expectations, and start again but more gradually. Keep in mind that you’re two years older and you’re now putting a lot more weight stress on your joints and muscles, from the extra fat weight. I suggest that you begin with just walking for a mile. When you can do that without stopping to catch your breath, then gradually add time to your walk, and/or add speed, and/or add incline, all of which are easier to accomplish on a treadmill. When you can walk very briskly for two miles, uphill, without having to stop to catch your breath (which might take around six weeks or so to reach that level of fitness) and after you’ve lost some meaningful pounds, then you’re ready to run again.

However UAE not only has strong relations with India but also awarded their highest civilian award to PM modi. This trend #Boycott UAE originated from Turkey and then picked up by Pakistan as an opportunity- Why does Turkey oppose India and support Pak Turkey’s support to Pakistan over Kashmir is an attempt to counter Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and Turkey are rivals in the Muslim world. By backing Pakistan, Turkey hopes that Islamabad will side with Ankara and move away from Saudi Arabia. The fact that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have backed India’s position Kashmir is further used by Turkey to woo Pakistan. Strong objection and action by Modi government against Turkey PM Modi cancelled a trip to Turkey. It was a warning given to Turkey that their stand with Pak will be consistent as a stand against India.India withdrew its contracts, 2.3 billion tender granted to Turkey’s Anadolu Shipyard earlier this year to help build five 45,000-tonne fleet support ships for the Hindustan Shipyard Limited is reported to be cancelled.Syria was encouraged by India to become more aggressive against Turkey at international platforms. The Syrian envoy also said, \\"Turkey supports terror and all countries who support Turkey, support terror\\". He said this in response to a question on Pakistan extending support to Turkey's military offensive in Syria. The Turkish regime invasion of Syria is a clear aggression and in violation of all international laws and UN Charter, Syria said.When Erdogan raised the Kashmir issue at the UNGA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tesponded by holding meetings with the president of Cyprus and prime ministers of Armenia and Greece on the sidelines of the UNGA. All of these states have various disputes with Turkey. So the enemies of Turkey were promised support in future by India.India pushed forward its relations with Armenia. Recently India secured a 40 million defence deal with Armenia. As per the deal, India will be supplying Armenia with four weapon locating radars. So India will help the enemies of Turkey to become more powerful. In short, such trends are made viral by our enemies however India is strong enough to teach them lessons at the right time. Pakistan is a terrorist organization, any country standing with then will be seen as a terrorist country too. I hope Turkey understands that.

To resolve this situation there are virtual browsers that can work/perform like a real browser with the help of Artificial intelligence. There are a number of tools in the market now that provide all the browsers and their versions on a single platform. Here are some of the best tools for maximum browser compatibility including [LINKED_TEXT: AI testing] [URL: https://blog.qasource.com/resources/ai-testing-tools-that-drive-automation]: 1.

First of all, I need to say, that the loss of the 3rd battle of Panipat by the Great Marathas was actually a betrayal. It was not just Rajputs and jats who didn’t support the great Marathas but the 3rd battle of Panipat was actually a betrayal by the Sikhs against the Great Marathas. It was not just the first time that Sikhs betrayed Hindus but they did it earlier too in 1746. Let's come back to the point that why Jats and Rajputs didn’t help Marathas. The answer is, Marathas didn’t have good relations with them at that time because under the leadership of Peshwa Raghunath Rao, Balaji Vishwanath, and Shivaji, the Marathas empire was at its peak and they defeated Nizams, Mughals, Rajputs, etc and that made them against the Great Marathas. The question rises, Rajputs and Jatts didn’t support Marathas, and off-course that is because of their defeat but why Sikhs betrayed Marathas as the Marathas were the ones who saved Sikhs from Durrani in the battle of “Maratha conquest of the northwest frontier” in 1760. The betrayal of Sikhs against Marathas considers being one of the biggest betrayals in history. It all starts in 1760 when Taimur shah (Durrani) attacked the northwest frontier of Punjab (then Pashtuns and Satluj region of Punjab) and Sikhs were outnumbered by the Durrani. Upon a single call by the Sikhs, the fearless Peshwa Raghunath Rao marched for Pashtun and covered the entire journey in 36 hours. Peshwas reached Pashtun and fought on behalf of Sikhs and defeated a Durrani who had 3 times larger force than Marathas. Durrani got the treaty of leaving the place and deposition of money which was given back to Sikhs for their resettlement. And then Durrani left. The bad thing with the Hindu rulers was, they never killed their opponents, let it be Prithviraj Chauhan or Maharana Pratap, or even the Marathas. Durrani returned in 1761 in the first battle of Panipat with a larger number of forces to invade the region. This time he returned with the support of the Oudh empire, Mughals, and off-course Rohillas. The twist comes when Rohillas commander Shuja-ud-Daula who had good relations with Sikhs met Sikhs and he asked them not to come in-between and in return, they will give them the land to Sikhs. Marathas were confident that they will not get support from the Rajputs and Jatts, but they were sure that Sikhs will support them as Marathas were the ones who saved them and Sikhs owes their life to the great Marathas. But eventually, everything got collapsed and Sikhs denied to support them, and it was the Marathas who were fighting against FOUR powerful empires all alone. This particular incident was one of its kind of biggest betrayals in Indian history. Now, you must willing to know what was the 1st betrayal by the Sikhs. Jaspat Rai, a Hindu [LINKED_TEXT: Mughal] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire] official, was the [LINKED_TEXT: faujdar] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faujdar] of [LINKED_TEXT: Jalandhar] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalandhar] and later was appointed faujdar of [LINKED_TEXT: Eminabad] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminabad] by [LINKED_TEXT: Zakariya Khan Bahadur] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakariya_Khan_Bahadur].

It was not settled anyway, and Lakhpat Rai ( Brother of Jaspat Rai) decided to take revenge for the death of his brother which was done in the shield of cowardness. Lakhpat Rai as the brother of Jaspat Rai became the revenue minister of [LINKED_TEXT: Lahore] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore] and wanted to take revenge on the Sikhs.

Her mother was very charismatic—the kind of person who could talk to anyone—and a genius who graduated from University of Chicago at age 16. Also a beauty. But, out of the blue, her mother stood up, walked up to within six inches of a wall and started talking to it, carrying on a seemingly nonsensical conversation. I was pretty young, certainly no more than seven or eight, but you don’t have to be a genius even at that age to know that this is totally not normal. It didn’t scare me. She was clearly not any threat to me. In fact, I was trying to figure out what she was saying when her dad gently hustled me out of the room. We remained friends, and all the times after when I saw my friend or her mother, nothing was ever said about this. I remember not wanting to embarrass them. My friend’s mother spent many years cycling in and out of state mental hospitals, and was a diagnosed schizophrenic. But mostly what I remember about her was how much fun she was to be with—so lively and captivating. My friend finds it hard to believe that is my memory. That’s because hers are darker and the few “fun” times totally obscured by them. We’ve never talked in depth, but what little she said about her mother was sad. They lived on edge waiting for her next loss of contact with reality, and had to deal repeatedly with committing her and enduring her long absences and returns. My friend also feared her children might inherit the mental illness and so she never had children of her own, but did marry a man with several children. Whenever I mentally picture a psychotic episode, even though I’ve seen far more dramatic ones in movies, this is what has remained with me as the “real thing.”"},{"instruction":"What is the treatment on Discounted bill/LC Outstanding under IND AS, before IND AS same were consider as Contingent Liability?","output":"As per my understanding of Ind AS.

The ultimate goal of the date should not be to secure a second date. Your only goal should be to achieve a positive outcome and have fun. The positive outcome is for both parties to feel as though the date was worthwhile, whether or not it leads to a second date. (Even if you don't click, a positive outcome could result in her saying, \\"Hey, I have a friend who you would be perfect with!\\" and setting up a second date.)

SELECT YOUR LOCATION image credit: pixabay For first dates, coffee shops are ideal. Avoid Starbucks because they are noisy and have very exposed seating. Choose a local café with a more intimate, cozy atmosphere. Coffee dates can be as short or as long as you want, and they aren't expensive. image credit: pixabay Bowling is a fun activity that doesn't cost much money and can be added to the mix. Most people have gone bowling at least once in their lives, and few dislike it. The light competition encourages flirting and laughter. Bowling, on the other hand, may require more time than you anticipated. Furthermore, you'll be leaving the table to bowl, which may cause the conversation to pause. Bowling may be more appropriate for a later date, but it can be an excellent first date if you already know the person (for example, if you have asked out a friend). Mini golf is similar to bowling, as mentioned previously. Arcades are similar to video games in terms of activity and competition, but with a slightly geeky twist. Ice cream dates, like coffee dates, are best in the late evening and can be as short or as long as you like. Drinks at the bar as a late-night activity if you're of legal drinking age and prefer a spicy or flirty atmosphere. Remember that this can quickly become expensive, and it may be better to save the alcohol for a later date. The pool at the bar is similar to the drinks at the bar, but with a little more lighthearted, flirtatious fun. And, unlike bowling, you're always right next to your date, so the conversation doesn't have to stop for the game to continue. If the weather is bad, you can do everything inside. You could always combine two options, such as bowling and ice cream, if the date is going well. If the weather permits, combine one of the above options with a walk or other outdoor activity! Low-key touching (such as hand holding) is fine, but be respectful about it (e.g., \\"Do you mind if we hold hands?\\") 2. SELECT YOUR TIME Avoid scheduling a first date around a large meal, such as dinner or lunch. Meals are expensive, and you're taking a bigger risk if you don't get a positive result. Morning or early afternoon dates always appear more casual and less sexual than late evening dates, so keep that in mind depending on your preferences. Make a time frame for yourself as well. Mention before the date that you must leave at a specific time after the date begins. A solid window would be an hour and a half. That way, if the date doesn't go well, you can back out without offending the other party. If the date is going well, finishing it on a positive note increases the likelihood of a second date.

WHAT SHOULD YOU WEAR? image credit: pixabay Wear something that makes you look good, dress for the weather or season, and make sure you're comfortable and sure of yourself for the date activity. On that note, avoid wearing orange or brown, as these colors are unflattering to the majority of people. Solid colors include black, red, and blue. Business casual is acceptable; however, a tailored T-shirt or blouse and jeans may also be acceptable depending on the activity. Make sure you smell nice and are clean. 4. START A CONVERSATION image credit: pixabay When you first see your date (whether you're picking them up, they're picking you up, or you're meeting at a location), put on a smile and greet them. \\"Hello, by (their name), my name is (your name), and it's a pleasure to meet you!\\" or \\"Hey, (their name), great to see you again!\\" depending on the circumstances. A brief hug would be appropriate here, but be respectful (for example, by asking, \\"Do you like hugs?\\"). A handshake would be appropriate, but a little too professional for the situation. Read their movements and expressions and choose your action accordingly. Before engaging in physical contact, always obtain their permission. And if someone touches you in an inappropriate way, don't be afraid to say no and establish a firm boundary. Your comfort and safety are critical and should be prioritized. It is also customary in many cultures to greet your date with a kiss on both cheeks! 5. HOLD A CONVERSATION Stay away from certain topics as you go through your date, such as... ⦁ Family saga ⦁ Dramatic polities ⦁ Your sexual habits and history ⦁ Your ex, or lack thereof ⦁ How much money do you have or earn? Unless these topics are extremely important to you and your date, you can only move forward if you are on the same page; or unless you can navigate these topics appropriately, respectfully, and without a narrow mind, it is best not to directly ask about... ⦁ Affiliation with a political party ⦁ Religious beliefs ⦁ Health, including disabilities, physical and mental illnesses, and so on ⦁ Future prerequisites (like kids or marriage) Maintain a positive tone in the conversation. If you can avoid it, avoid self-deprecation. It's fine to make a joke about how you can't cook to save your life or how you're terrified of heights, but only if it's funny and you can back it up with a funny, confident story. Overall, I know it sounds obvious, but be yourself! Learn about them. You're attempting to assess their personality as much as they are attempting to assess yours. After that, your date should have a good idea of: ⦁ What you do for fun, your hobbies, passions, and interests ⦁ Your job, what you do for a living (without mentioning money), and possibly your most basic career goal for the future ⦁ If you're still in school, your educational path ⦁ Where you come from In this regard, you should also have a good idea of your date. Avoid flat questions like \\"What are your hobbies?\\" when asking questions. \\"What exactly do you do?\\" Instead, ask alternative questions, such as \\"So, if you weren't on this date right now, what would you be doing instead?\\" or \\"I noticed on your profile that you enjoy traveling!\\" That's fantastic; where have you been?\\" or \\"You mentioned you like skating, which is really cool.\\" How did you begin doing that?\\" Even if your date asks you a simple question, you can still respond in a way that leads to a more in-depth conversation. For example, suppose your date begins with \\"How are you?\\" Instead of saying, \\"How are you?\\" say something interesting. \\"I'm fine; thank you for asking!\\" I recently began a new Netflix series that has me hooked, so life is good right now. \\"How are you doing?\\" (This would allow him or her to ask more questions, such as about the Netflix series or whatever.) As the conversation progresses, you may be tempted to tell a scary, funny, or crazy story. Go for it, as long as the story ends happily! You can narrate the tale of how a shark bit you and your friends hauled you out or saved you, but if one of your friends drowned in the process, that's nightmare material, not material for a first date. \\"First-time\\" stories (for example, the first time skiing or surfing) can also be amusing as long as they are not sexual in nature. you can learn more about a conversation on chat, click [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/meetyourmatchnow/home?read_current=1] If the conversation becomes dull, make a comment about the atmosphere. \\"Wow, the bowling alley is packed today. \\"Have you visited here before?\\" \\"Dairy Queen ice cream never gets old,\\" for example. \\"Do you have a preferred flavor?\\" 6. EXTEND COMPLIMENTS Be cautious when flattering your partner. Aside from style, don't compliment physical features. Instead, try to compliment them on things they say, but don't go overboard. complement your choices and actions, not your genes. Assume your date recently mentioned her hobby of writing books. \\"Wow, I really respect that!\\" That must require a great deal of dedication and talent. \\" Painting is another option. \\"Wow! That's incredible!\\" \\"Do you have any images of your work you could show me?\\" Or he casually mentioned a loved one's recent death. \\"I'm sorry; that must have been difficult. You appear to be a very strong individual.\\" AVOID sexual compliments AT ALL COSTS. She doesn't need to hear about her boobs, and he doesn't need someone to compliment his muscles. Discussing his weightlifting hobby and obsessing over his muscles are two completely different things. 7. WHO IS PAYING? image credit: pixabay Regardless of societal gender norms, you should always expect to pay for both parties or split the bill on a date. If you set up the date, you should probably pay for both of you. If your date set it up or it was mutual (like on a dating website), you should probably split the cost. Always offer to pay your share politely, even if the other party has chosen to pay for you. If the date went well, you may offer to pay for it, especially if you initiated the date in the first place. 8. REJECTION OF A SECOND DATE So the date has come to an end. You had a good conversation and are now at home, but you didn't feel the spark. You receive a text message several hours or a day after you leave to thank you for a great time, but you aren't interested in a second date. How do you politely decline? \\"Thank you so much for tonight!\\" I'm not looking for a second date right now, but I hope you have a good rest of your day. \\"You seem like a nice guy, but we're just not the right fit!\\" Have a wonderful weekend. \\"If your date becomes pushy or insistent, a simple \\"no\\" will suffice. After you've shown kindness once, you don't need to justify, argue, defend, or explain. 9. SUGGESTING A SECOND DATE So the date was a success! Allow your date and yourself some time to process the success. Waiting until the next day is ideal, but it's also polite to say, \\"Text me when you're home safe!\\" if the date ends late at night. Send them an upfront message after some time has passed. 1. \\"Hey, I had a great time last night, and I would love to see you again. \\"Can you do (X activity) on (X date) at (X time)?\\" That may seem overly specific, but it's the best way to gauge interest. If they respond positively, you've got this! Fantastic if they respond with a different date or time! If they simply say they're busy, it means they'd prefer another day or time and haven't articulated it properly, or they're simply not interested. Assume the worst. When your date is preoccupied, put the ball in their court. 2. \\"No worries. If your schedule opens up and you want to see each other again, just let me know. Bam. Done. It wasn't difficult, and you handled potential rejection with poise. You don't close off future opportunities this way, but you do appear understanding and non-pushy. I hope these suggestions are useful and not excessive! I know some of these may seem obvious, but I've noticed that many of my friends struggle in these areas.

Written by Niel Menon Source:[LINKED_TEXT: Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?] [URL: http://www.chennaimemes.co.in/2016/02/why-are-kannadigas-least-known-among.html?spref=fb&m=1] The simple answer: Because Kannadigas are most accommodating and adjustable people in the south. I ( Niel Menon) am not a Kannadiga, but I have lived here for the past 8 years and I would like to share my views here. I've lived not just in Bangalore, but in a few other cities too. I have travelled from Mysuru to Hubbali, from Chickmagalur to Karawar, from Belgaum to Hospet and believe me when I say, Kannadigas are probably the most accommodating people you will ever meet. The Bangalore - Mysuru belt is known for the immigrants, tourists, and backpackers. The locals here are really proud of who they are and would love to share what they have with you - rich culture, traditions, festivals, everything! They don't want anything in return. No need for any media limelight, no need for any viral youtube videos, and there's no need for publicity. Nope, they're good! Go towards Hubbali-Dharward, and you'll feel you're in North India! It's the trading hub of the state and you will find Marwaris, Gujaratis, Marathis, and several other North Indians here. They're the capital of Hindustani classical music and literally every family belongs to some gharana or the other. If you love classical music and some fantastic sweets, just befriend a local because, again, they keep most of this to themselves and you wouldn't know where to look. Coastal Karnataka - Mangaluru, Udupi, Karwar, well, you'll find the most polite Kannadigas here. The dialect they speak here is pure poetry! This is where I learnt all my Kannada! Enjoy the beautiful beaches, the coastal cuisine, take as many pictures as you want, and stay as long as you want. How many non Kanndigas have heard of Bengre Beach, Kaup Beach, or Koodlu Falls? Very few, I'm sure! This is because none of these are openly publicized. Doesn't mean you aren't welcome! You most certainly are! Kannadigas love staying away form the limelight. In fact, they hate the spotlight. Besides, they have always valued education very strongly and this has helped them connect with people from different parts of the country very easily. Allow me to illustrate: I was at a small village called Parkala, about 5 kms from Udupi for a taste of authentic Udupi cuisine. Someone had told us that there was this food joint, a rather shabby and worn down place, run by a very senior elderly couple, Ajja and Ajji, that served the best vegetarian meal we'd ever had. We wanted to give it a shot. The couple who welcomed us in would have been easily in their late 70s or early 80s. Frail, wrinkled, and slightly hunched. But they welcomed us warmly. The place was a part of their own home that they had transformed into a little cafe that served lunch. We all took our place and feasted ourselves to truly the best meal I had ever had. The payasa (rice pudding, I think it's called in English!) at the end blew my mind so hard that I wanted another helping. I looked at my friend and told him that I wanted another helping of payasa. I wasn't too fluent in Kannada back then and I asked him to help me out. So, he called Ajji, the lady, and asked her for the same. She walked towards me, looked at my empty plate, and said: \\"I'll get you a big glass!\\" in the most fluent English. I just gaped at her! Almost everyone in Karnataka speaks English or Hindi - no matter how broken it is! Bangalore would NOT have evolved into what it is today if it was not for the accommodating nature of the locals. It would not have transformed into what it is today had the Kannadigas not rolled with the changes. No matter where you are from, people will try to communicate with you in English, Hindi or even sign language! Yes, there are instances of \\"North Indian Bashing\\" and \\"Bloody Hindiwalah\\" stuff in some places. But most of that is primarily due to some bad experience they have had with someone or the other. Otherwise, they're really peaceful people who'd rather mind their own business than poke their nose into yours. I love Karnataka. The state has been my home for the past 8 years and has contributed significantly into transforming me into who I am today. I have always felt welcome wherever I travelled within the state. As I began to learn Kannada, people would actually appreciate my attempt at speaking the language and that would land with with some additional benefits like a 90 at the price of a 60 at my local bar, fresher fish, cheaper internet installation, getting away without wearing a helmet on a few occasions, etc. When people are nice, I doubt it gives much scope for gossip or bad press.

It is the new way to get your teeth right. Mostly the term cosmetic dentistry is associated with only making superficial changes in teeth to make a patient’s smile look better.

Let’s get a closer look at what exactly cosmetic dentistry is, all its aspects, and where can you find the [LINKED_TEXT: best cosmetic dentist in Perth] [URL: https://www.ashtonavenuedental.com.au/dental-service/cosmetic-dentistry]. What is cosmetic dentistry? Cosmetic dentistry is the process of correcting dental anomalies to enhance the appearance of a smile, as well as the functionality of teeth. Dental anomalies are the conditions that stop your teeth from looking and performing their best. The most common types of dental anomalies include: Chipped or broken toothMissing teethChipped or broken tooth fillingMisaligned or crooked teethDiscoloured teeth Cosmetic dentistry helps people enhance their smiles and resolve many dental problems. People having bad teeth know their struggle on daily basis. It is very difficult to chew food properly with crooked teeth. Misalignment of teeth in any severe form whether cross-bite, under-bite, or overbite can damage adjoining oral tissues such as gums or the internal lining of cheeks. Treating it with a proper [LINKED_TEXT: orthodontic] [URL: https://www.ashtonavenuedental.com.au/dental-service/orthodontics-treatment] option can make all the difference. It allows the patient to chew food without hurting. The bad appearance of teeth in the form of discolouration or broken or unevenly sized front tooth can also make some people feel bad about themselves. As a smile is one of the first features that people might notice about a person, people anxious about this fact can worry more about the appearance of their smile. A cosmetic dentistry procedure can hence help uplift the low confidence or self-esteem in many people. They feel happier with themselves and adopt a confident approach towards life after having their teeth corrected.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","output":"I work out of a co-working space called the [LINKED_TEXT: Frankston Foundry] [URL: https://apply.frankstonfoundry.com/] in Melbourne Australia which is filled with startup CEO’s. Above is an image of the first location we had before we had to move to a larger location. There I work with a lot of fellow startups in tech. Personally, I have my own micro agency focusing on conversion optimization and growth hacking. So the following answer is based both on my own experience and what I have seen from the people around me. What is a day in the life of a start-up CEO? It varies a lot from person to person. I see some of my colleagues get in early others late. Most start their day with coffee, however, most of the time the place is half empty because most of the entrepreneurs are out and about. Some have met with clients, others are busy working on getting early traction. For instance one of the founders in the space Marshall, has a company [LINKED_TEXT: Passel] [URL: http://www.passel.com.au/] which get people who are on the way home to bring a package that they can deliver and make some money on. One day he was working on putting together a booth in a shopping centre nearby which you can see a shot of above. One of the founders of the Frankston Foundry, Cameron, is often out and about having meetings with the city council or going to other networking. James, another co-founder, runs the tech and is often seen walking in a hundred different directions at the same time. Personally, I am seen somewhere between my beloved beanbag and a nearby table connecting with people on LinkedIn, being in communication with my techs, or at times in one of the meeting rooms chatting with clients. To help out the owners of the space at times I do live presentations on entrepreneurship and innovation to high school students. What are their responsibilities? Everything! One of the challenges everyone around me has is that although you might delegate some of the work to others, in the end, it is you are accountable, and most importantly, care the most about the outcome! Add to that that most startups are as well organized as a woman’s handbag and you have an environment ripe for a brain aneurysm. So for instance on one day I might hear a story of stock which has not arrived on time, techs who have not delivered, or a grant application which has to be submitted by 5 o’clock. In the middle of all that there are babies which have to be picked up, coffee runs and the random tray of free food occasionally being close to healthy. Stress levels are at times high but lowered by good (and bad) humour. What do they do every single day to grow their company? I might have answered this one above; if it is a startup, there is probably not a standard day. You have what you said you would do, what you ended up doing, and what you wish you did before, well, everything happened. What I can say from seeing most people around me is that they work more in the business than they want to, sorting out real issues in real time, trying to make the best calls they can base on the information they have at the time, and their gut feeling. The tasks might vary, but what they all have in common is a desire to try and to improve."},{"instruction":"What are some first date tips?","output":"be yourself."},{"instruction":"tempered glass fragile?","output":"It is harder to break than non tempered glass and if it does break, it crumbles into small pieces rather than sharp shards."},{"instruction":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","output":"THE SUBSTITUTION:Krul comes on for Cillessen in the 121st minute much to the latter's surprise. So why does van Gaal do this? THE DECISIONPlanned in advance:This was not a decision that Louis van Gaal took in the last minute. It was something that was well planned out from before. Tim Krul was prepped by the goal keeping coach and was told that if the situation arose, he would have to take the place between the posts during the shootout. van Gaal hid this plan from Cillessen so that it would not damage his confidence or affect his game. CILLESSEN Cillessen was clearly unhappy about being substituted. He probably felt he wasn't believed in or was not a big fan of the fact that he wasn't informed in advance. However, he was seen passionately celebrating each Dutch penalty and also the saves that Krul made. He hopefully understood the genius behind the change. van Gaal made it a point to dispel any rumors of a change in the number one keeper for the rest of the tournament, claiming Cillessen remains his number one choice. THE ADVANTAGESRendered any prior Costa Rican preparation uselessIf the Costa Ricans had prepared for penalties, they would have studied Cillessen and his motions. However, in walked this other guy whom they did not research at all. He's very confident and is mouthing taunts at them. They have no idea who he is nor have they studied his motions. Also, it may have helped that Costa Rica had its previous game go to penalties. He probably observed how they approached that shootout. Surprise, bit**!When you are so surprised at such a critical stage of an important match, you feel outwitted. It's like preparing all night for one proof of a theorem or a topic for an examination because you are a 100% sure that it will be asked and then you find a 100 mark question on something you didn't study for at all. Even though you may still get it, your confidence is not high at all. DeceptionKrul is not a specialist at saving penalties. A record of 2 saves out of 20 is not the sign of a penalty specialist. But did the Costa Ricans know that? He sure looks like a penalty expert for all they know. Why would van Gaal bring him on otherwise? Clearly, a psychological decision and not a tactical one. Pressure and attention off his playersThis was THE MOST IMPORTANT reason as far as I'm concerned. As soon as van Gaal made the change, all the attention deflected from the kick takers to the decision he made. If Netherlands, who have a horrible record at penalty shootouts, had indeed lost, he would have been blamed for a ludicrous decision. No one expected anything from Tim Krul either. Thus, it was a sacrificial move, showing that he was ready to take the heat in case something went wrong. Penalty shootouts are won and lost very easily. It's about handling your nerves well. When the pressure was off the Dutch kick takers, their experience came to the fore. He sent his four most experienced kick takers (with Huntelaar probably in line to take the fifth) to ensure nervousness would play no role in the result of a spot kick. And then, something amazing happened. Four perfect penalties. Even the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, who had such an amazing tournament and game and should have been coming into the shootout with great confidence, would have been slightly shaken by the sudden presence of the chatty Krul. The Dutch keeper dives the right way each time (5 out 5, saving two of them) after taunting the opposing kick takers into making mistakes. (His first save wasn't really extraordinary or anything.) This is probably the result of his studies of the kick takers from the previous shootout that Costa Rica took part in. The players may have had conflicts about whether they should stick to what worked for them last time or if they should do something fancy to beat this \\"penalty expert,\\" whose job was just to apparently find out which way they were going to go.

The Strings have different properties and may be Zero dimensional, One dimensional or Two dimensional. Electromagnetism is one of the four known forces and it is my opinion that Electromagnetism is a combination of the Electric String and the Magnetic String. The Electric String is a straight one dimensional string and the Magnetic String is a curved two dimensional string so when we combine the two the product is a three dimensional Helical FIELD that propagates in a straight line ( unless altered by external forces ). Combinations of different string types manifest different types of particles and fields. Gravity is the effect of Mass on space-time and is the Negative Energy counter balance of the Positive Energy of the Mass. The preceding text is a type of String theory and there are many to choose from. Presumption all particles consist of two strings. From my perspective this allows for up to 272 different types of particles."},{"instruction":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Well it seems like the same issue but they're very secret. It's like it's where everyone goes to pretend to be in school. In this day and age anyways. Private schools had dress code and students may get beaten or molested/raped at school or abused at home in their personal lives. This may also go on at public schools particularly with younger kids and the people disappear over state or county lines after, sometimes the kids did zero work or learning and they all got molested or raped all day long everyday by every pedophile that knew. They all get called into a room one by one. It may be necessary to castrate the population. We also thought private schools may be proper regular people or spies but public schools became so full of spies that you would think the entire federal government of washington dc was africans or Asians but there was that one white englewood guy going around as george w Bush calming everyone down. They ruined all the public companies like samsung or frito lay through this wayne westland public school system existing and then it turns into these other businesses that were all provably illegal if we really thought about it and someone tries to take everything over named william r wild. Everyone in westland michigan and surrounding areas were all orphans from an orphanage (it was the same as in the movie Annie and its practically live footage and why the movie was filmed, they pretend it was acting) where they would turn everyone back into kids and try and lock them in one giant abandon brick wall company building, everyone in the orphanages or locked in the buildings had mumps. And they ended up wanting to help mumps or they all wanted to become mumps or yeasts. This is why it was dangerous to be around anyone from living situations like that as capitalists like Louis vuitton, we use to do so much for all of these people for no reason at all. It was very dangerous because they were use to nothing and the worst living conditions. We chose as two dudes to live outside alone or together and we just went around burning everyone's outdoor toys they stole or got through communism or union conspiracies. We were just fine libing outside or traveling as western cowboys or it turns into fascism with constant athletics and building and discussions and events but spies tried turning it into machine food production and grocery stores they can all work at. Eventually we set everyone free and forced everyone to live in houses and only the flu virus would exist and be released a few times a year to kill everything else off. Schools are very contagious and dirty. Lots of people, germs and janitors slack off or people break ionizer to spread disease and doctors or to exist as a disease person who needs a local host. Regardless of degrees, diplomas, certifications, most of the world population (communist or not) is stupid and illiterate, cant comprehend, (it would come backas retarded to everyone who isnt it) or they just look for more school work to do. They use to turn everything into a patent or job process in a class called technology, it had to turn everything into a competition for a prize ir job or money in return. Besides catholics satanists or capitalists that learn as they go on their way or business or pleasure or at home. Mumps and other diseases are going to have to do this again to try and survive, so it will be like the last 75 years of everyone lieing and doing all this annoying and bad shit didnt take place and everyone will return to misery. I don't know why we traded orphans for their mumps."},{"instruction":"Why do console games still get physical releases but PC games don't?","output":"Every major PC release for the past decade has required you to connect to the internet and link your game to an account of some sort (usually Steam) thus rendering the disk entirely pointless as you can’t link it to a different account. This rendered the disk entirely worthless as you couldn’t use it to install the game on another PC, lend it to a friend or sell it again. Soon gamers decided to just cut out the middle man and just buy all their games online as it was cheaper and easier and you got the same result. The market for physical PC games became practically non-existent. Physical console games aren’t tied to the console. I can buy a game finish it, lend it to my friend, get it back from them and then sell it to someone else. (Sony even did an instructional video) Therefore there is still a market for physical console games and thus publishers fill that market."},{"instruction":"w do needlepoint cross stitch and embroidery differ?","output":"I concur re the advice to try canvaswork embroidery. The stitches are straight, it is executed on canvas (many different “counts” to the inch or cm, meaning how fine or coarse the canvas is) and you count the threads. It is possible to be marvellously creative with canvas work. Canvas work is a form of counted-thread embroidery. Common types of canvas work include needlepoint, petit point, and bargello. Bargello is the most wonderful type of canvaswork embroidery! There is “Hungarian point”, “Florentine work”, “flame stitch”, “zig-zag stitchery” and these can, once you are skilled, be mixed with other types of canvaswork stitches. You can use woollen yarns, cotton thread, metallic thread and silk thread in the same piece of embroidery. The possibilities are endless! A small, simple piece to get you started: needlepoint hearts. Depending on the choice of colours and design, you can create an embroidery that looks as though it has three dimensions. Geometric 3D Bargello canvaswork. You can also design pieces where it looks as though different parts are woven under and over other parts - another optical illusion. This one too is an optical illusion; a very different type of design. This needlepoint design resembles canework. More optical illusion. A Bargello rope design. You can embroider a Bargello border that looks like an undulating ribbon. This is the famous “carnation pattern”. The colours are rather weird in this photo. I have seen the original piece in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. It is several hundred years old. Bargello, flame stitch, Hungarian point, zig-zag stitch were very popular in Tudor and Jacobean times, actually. Just look at this example called Bargello roses! Three old patterns for Hungarian point designs. Hungarian point pattern in day glo colours. A flame stitch design, also called zig-zag stitchery. A Bargello design that resembles stained glass. The colours glow! Another, different Bargello stained glass design. Then there is 4-way Bargello, where you count from the central hole and stitch outwards. This design resembles a traditional Spanish glazed tile. You can also design Celtic style needlepoint canvaswork. Another Four-way Bargello design, very pretty (in my opinion). This one is lovely, I think. Four-way Bargello, executed in silky threads. GOOD LUCK and enjoy stitching some fine pieces of needlepoint!"},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"Yes, even if they dominate the touch technology in their iPad and iPhone!.

It’s French for Licorice. I am French, and so was the cat (duh). It was in the early 90s. I must have been 13. Back then my house was near very traditional farms, not the large industrial monsters of today, just a couple of pigs, cows, and the like. The land was cheap so the houses were large, gardens expansive and everyone had plenty of fresh air. In my house, we had 5 cats (Ficelle (“Piece of string”), Réglisse, Boud’zan, Vanille, and Charlie), as well as dogs, hens, fish, even a tortoise. A real menagerie. Now, Réglisse was always a bit different. He liked his space. Whilst the other cats were happy cuddling with their humans on the sofa, Réglisse had his very own private spot on top of the shelf. He also ate alone, and even if he was a very sociable creature, Réglisse was more of an introvert. He was never fond of being picked up and preferred to walk rather than being carried. I liked him. He was aloof, in a cool way. One day my older brother brings a new dog - a Labrador pup. His name was Jeff. Réglisse must have had enough of this s**t. He left that night and never came back. I searched for him for days. Then maybe a week later, I hear Réglisse in the street as I walked home from school - I recognized that voice. I call for him, and here he is, popping his head out of a bush! A little girl comes after him. Maybe 6 or 7 tops. She looks at me, picks up Réglisse, and tells me, “I don’t like when he goes into the streets”. For a brief second, I thought to tell her it was MY cat. But then, I thought, they both looked happy. So I nodded, and said, “nice cat, where did you get it?” She smiles and says “He just came to our house. he likes my dad’s bookshelf”. Damn, Réglisse. — PS: Réglisse would still pop by for a few minutes to visit - but never came into the house ever again."},{"instruction":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","output":"x + y = 2 So, (x+y)^2 = 2^2 x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 4 (x^2 + y^2) + 2xy = 4 (2) + 2xy = 4 2xy = 2 xy = 1 I suppose this is where answer should end"},{"instruction":"What are some recommended laptops for college?","output":"Everyone has their preferences and [LINKED_TEXT: needs when it comes to laptops] [URL: https://laptopschamp.com/how-much-storage-do-i-need-on-my-laptop/].

What didn't bother me was what a 23-year-old man chose to get tattooed on his arm. Whatever the tattoo, whether you like it or not, is how you express yourself. on his skin. If a Junkook tattoo bothers you, maybe you should take a moment and think about why it affects you. Hate the spontaneity of his decision? Maybe tattoos in your culture or environment are objectionable, making it uncomfortable to see the guy you love get a full sleeve?

This may be due to specifics in timbre and such, so the proper performance aids in getting the correct sound.There are techniques that are accepted as standard or typical.

Look for the flash in the lower left corner. The fragments were maybe a kilometer or so across, impacting at 60 km/s. Assuming the same density as water, this would mean an impact energy, or explosion energy of over 400 megatons for an average fragment, possibly up to ten times more energy for the biggest. A 400 megaton explosion is about an order of magnitude bigger than the most powerful nuclear bomb in existence, or maybe about 2–3% of humanity’s total nuclear arsenal.

Her biological mother has not been there for her. I still do not see the need to put anyone of us under that extra pressure of a DNA test after already dealing with abandonment issues from her mother.

Being a Kannadiga and having lived in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and now in the US, I believe that I am in a fairly good position to answer this question. I have tried reading most of the answers and wont elaborate on the obvious but pardon me if its repetitive. I think the single most important reason for this is the DIVERSITY that Karnataka has to offer. If India is the one of the most diverse country in the world then Karnataka is undoubtedly one of the most diverse states in India. It would not be completely wrong to say \\"Karnataka is like an India within India\\". DIVERSITY Karnataka can be broadly classified into four regions. 1) Mumbai Karnataka 2) Hyderabad Karnataka 3) Mysore/Bangalore Karnataka and 4) Mangalore Karnataka. Even though Kannada is the official and the most common language in all of these regions, it still has a lot of influence from other regional languages as well as languages from neighboring states. 1) Mumbai Karnataka The most prominent cities in this region are Hubli-Dharwad and Belgaum. It is almost impossible to find anyone from this region who does not understand or speak Hindi. Both these places were also under the maratha empire and you can see a lot of Maratha influence in these places especially in Belgaum(now known as Belagaavi). In fact, even the Maratha Light Infantry regiment is located in Belgaum. Till a decade ago, people from these regions used to prefer cities like Mumbai or Pune to relocate over big cities in Karnataka like Bangalore or Mysore. Even if you look at the traditions followed here, these places are closer to Pune than Mysore/Mangalore. Even the Kannada spoken here is quite different from the one spoken in the southern parts of Karnataka. This place has also given us some of the most prominent singers like Bhimsen Joshi and Gangubai Hanagal(both Hindustani Classical singers). It is also a bastion for the Hindustani music rather than the more popular Karnatic music in the Bangalore and Mysore regions. So when people from here move out of the state and meet other people, they would not easily associate themselves with Bangalore/Mysore because of the cultural differences. So the unity among the people is not as much as in the case of say Tamilians or Andhraites. 2) Hyderabad Karnataka Its the same case with cities like Gulbarga, Bellary and Bidar where you can find a lot of influence from the bordering Andhra Pradesh. In Bellary, it is highly unusual to meet a person who doesn't understand Telugu. Though Kannada is the most commonly used language, it is not the only language people know. 3) Mangalore/Karavali Karnataka The Kannada used in this region is by far the most grammatically and textually correct version of the beautiful language. People from this region speak impeccable Kannada with the least influence from English or Hindi. But even here, a large portion of the population uses Tulu instead of Kannada for all non-official usage. Konkani and Kodavi(in Kodugu) are also popular languages in this region. 4)Mysore region This region does not face any competition from other languages. Kannada is the most spoken language here.Due to the proximity, I also include Bangalore in this region. Now most of the songs or movies made in Kannada cater mostly to this population. The Problem and the Solution This diversity leads to the problem of identification. Because of so many cultural, traditional and geographical differences among the regions, it is difficult for people to relate to one true identity of the state. This is also one of the most important reasons why our film industry is in this pathetic state. I can hardly remember a movie that catered to say the people of North Karnataka or was entirely in North-Kannada dialect. So the people from other regions don't feel the same \\"connect\\" that say a person from Tamil Nadu would feel after watching a Tamil movie. But thankfully, the situation is improving now. People from Hubli/Belgaum or Mangalore prefer moving to Bangalore now instead of Mumbai due to the IT jobs and the development of Bangalore as a whole. The popularity of Kannada film industry can also be improved by incorporating actors and languages/slangs from other regions so that people from all these regions feel more connected to one true identity of the state.The identity of a Kannadiga."},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"You make sure that the food you do eat is nutritious and filling - eggs, walnuts, salmon, high-fibre carbs - and of course your stomach gradually adapts."},{"instruction":"ECB departing head Draghi insists that Germany and the Netherlands simply must spend more in the struggling EZ. What are the chances?","output":"Not good. Hyper Inflation looms large in the German pysche. Sadly the Germans have been comprehensively lied to about the cause of German hyperinflation. It was caused by the banks, not the government. The banks loaned speculators money to short the Reichsmark. And when I say “loaned” I mean “created”. This wasn’t money that existed in bank accounts and was loaned out, the banks created the money out of thin air. The government eventually stamped this out & the hyperinflation stopped but its the banks who caused it. Not expansionary fiscal policy by the government. Now the Germans who run fiscal policy making don’t know this, They have never been taught that banks create money. Its a bit of a well kept secret that’s actually been known within some circles for over a hundred years. They think that expansionary fiscal policy IS THE WORK OF SATAN! They think that running a deficit is SINFUL ! Germans aren’t big on debt. Even as recently as the Noughties I had a hard time using a credit card in many stores in Munich. However, Government “debt” and household “debt” aren’t the same thing. If your economy grows 2% you need 2% more money. Which means issuing bonds to the tune of 2% of GDP. Which is creating money, not borrowing it. Yes, OK, in the ERM, as a member you are borrowing it, but the ECB aren’t borrowing it. They just create it.

Up to yesterday I was accomplishing, I've not spoken to him for 3 weeks or so and haven't seen him for 6 or 7 weeks. In that time I was boosting up and I was going back to myself. I was thinking about him less and less, some days not even at all. I was asked out on a date by a bloke, he's a normal human, very intelligent, musical, talented, all kinds of other appealing things. He's quirky. I like quirk. He also has many mutual friends of mine and to a point I trust their judgement that he is as lovely as I've perceived him to be. I went out with him last night. Up to arriving, I was fine. I've met this bloke before and actually went to school with him. When I got there and we started the night, I may as well have had my narc exes sat with us. I heard every word that my date said. But I heard it differently, with edge that wasn't there. I had an affect on this man, he was very in to me and very much making it known, what I heard in my head was that I can't possibly be doing that because I'm not that special. How can he possibly like me? I'm not that beautiful. How can I keep up with the conversation with my crap qualifications? When he asked me questions that came up, things that I absolutely have no question about in my head, I couldn't answer, because I didn't trust my judgement enough to answer. Truth be told I'm very flattered by this man's interest, but every ounce of me is rejecting it because of the abuse from narc. How can it be that someone likes this worthless person? How can anyone take me seriously enough to respect me? How can I function without my narc to assist me in making decisions that I previously made for 36 years without his guidance? How can my reality be this damn skewed? Take time. When you believe the trauma bond is broken, just take that bit longer to heal.

Here are some of the key advantages of using a recumbent exercise bike: Comfortable and supportive seating: Recumbent bikes have a reclined position with a large, padded seat and a backrest. This design provides excellent support for your lower back and reduces strain on your joints, making them particularly suitable for individuals with back or joint problems.Reduced impact on joints: The recumbent position allows your body weight to be evenly distributed over a larger area, minimizing stress on your joints, especially the knees and ankles. This makes it an ideal choice for people with arthritis or those recovering from injuries.Cardiovascular workout: Like other types of stationary bikes, recumbent bikes provide an effective cardiovascular workout. Regular use can help improve heart and lung function, increase stamina, and enhance overall cardiovascular health.Lower risk of injury: Due to the supportive seating position and reduced impact on joints, recumbent bikes offer a lower risk of injury compared to high-impact exercises like running or jumping. This makes them suitable for people of all fitness levels, including beginners and those with physical limitations.Muscle toning and strength building: Recumbent bikes target various muscle groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, glutes, and even the core muscles. Regular use can help tone and strengthen these muscles, leading to improved lower body strength and stability.Convenience and accessibility: Recumbent exercise bikes are typically compact and can be used in the comfort of your home. They are easily adjustable to accommodate different body sizes and fitness levels, and you can exercise at any time that suits your schedule, regardless of the weather conditions.Multi-tasking and entertainment: Recumbent bikes often come with features such as built-in workout programs, resistance levels, and digital displays that track your progress. Many models also have holders for tablets, allowing you to watch videos, read, or listen to music while exercising, making your workout more enjoyable and engaging. It's worth noting that while recumbent exercise bikes offer many benefits, they may not provide the same intensity or calorie burn as some other forms of cardio exercise, such as running or cycling outdoors. However, they remain an excellent option for individuals seeking a low-impact workout with added comfort and support."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"The best ways to invest money depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some common and proven investment options to consider: Stocks: Investing in individual company stocks allows you to own a share of the company's ownership. Stocks have the potential for significant returns, but they also carry higher risks. Diversifying your stock portfolio is essential to reduce risk.Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations.
