In denying a previous attempt to delay Holmes' prison sentence, Davila said she had failed to raise a \\"'substantial question of law or fact' that is 'likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial on all counts.'\\" Earlier this month, Holmes and Balwani were ordered to pay 452 million in restitution to those who suffered damage from the company's fraud.

Tell me how the hot springs work. Tell me about a hot spring I can go visit, including its location and short description.","output":"Yes, there are hot springs on the Big Island of Hawaii. Here is some information about them. Hot springs in Hawaii are unique because they are heated by volcanic lava. Water in the mountains gets heated as it flows over underground magma. Some of the hot water will percolate up and pool in certain areas, creating hot springs for soaking. Hot springs on the Big Island are generally warm rather than very hot. As an area high in volcanic activity, hot springs are frequently created and destroyed by new lava flows. One hot spring on the Big Island to visit is Pohoiki Warm Springs. Located on Isaac Hale Beach in Puna, these hot springs were created after the 2018 volcanic eruption. This eruption made a new black sand beach and several hot spring pools along with it. There are about five hot springs on this beach heated by lava flowing underneath. Hot springs can be a lot of fun but also have their risks. Always check with local guides before entering hot springs."},{"instruction":"Write two paragraphs about companion plants for tomatoes that repel pests.","output":"Perhaps you're wondering what to plant with tomatoes to keep pests away. Numerous aromatic herbs and flowers double as natural bug repellents. Their strong odors can overpower the scent of other plants that insects like to feed on.

Certain plants, such as garlic, have strong enough odors to disguise the scent of their companion plants. Some pests also get disoriented by bright colors and avoid the area."},{"instruction":"Help me write an inner monologue for my novel about a young woman who starts to see the spirits of deceased souls around the time that she graduates from high school.

They were minuscule and shimmery, not too bright, easy enough to ignore except when I’d face the mirror or when I first woke in the morning and their glint would catch me off-guard. Day after day, I’d convince myself they were just a result of some glitter caught in the corner of my eyelid from spent eyeshadow, or maybe they were those spots that get stuck in your vision after you stare too hard at the sun. I even found myself wondering if maybe they’d always been there and I’d just been too immature or self-involved to notice before, like a child who’s blinded to the existence of adult concerns until they grow up and get muddled in the dregs of them personally. But like a faint ringing in the ears, they grew more and more difficult to dismiss as time went on. They never left me, all day long. They trailed me through the hallways at school, followed me on the bus home, and hovered above my shoulders while I sat at the dinner table. I couldn’t shake them, even if I sprinted in erratic zig-zags like somebody trying to dodge a bullet (yes, I actually tried this, and yes, it was just as humiliating as you might imagine). I did a series of web-based vision assessments and was heartbroken to learn that there was nothing wrong with my eyes and, in fact, I was an ideal candidate for air force pilot training. I rubbed my eyes raw. I remember scrubbing my skin till I nearly bled in the shower one day, haunted by the sense that I must have done something to bring this upon myself--that I was being punished by some God with a deeply twisted sense of justice. I even prayed that they would go away, despite being raised in a strictly atheist household.

Some decide that the effort involved in rediscovery is just too taking and too bothersome. It's pointless, really. It's easier to remain where you are. Why bother backtracking?

Ernie was the most lovable and loyal dog, and Katie loved him so. But Ernie had one tiny flaw that drove Katie absolutely crazy: his snoring. Each night, Katie would try to sleep, but Ernie's snoring would keep her up all night. It was so loud that you could hear him clearly on the opposite side of the house upstairs! Katie tried everything she could think of to make him stop. She gave him a special pillow to support his neck, ran a humidifier and a dehumidifier, and even tried doggie acupuncture, but nothing seemed to work. One day, Katie decided to take Ernie to the vet to see if there was anything they could do about his snoring. She just had to get some sleep. The vet examined him and told Katie that Ernie's snoring was caused by his little pug snout and allergies, which made it difficult for him to breathe properly. The vet recommended that Katie make some important changes to Ernie's lifestyle to help him breathe better, such as keeping him at a healthy weight and avoiding strenuous exercise. The vet also put Ernie on doggie allergy medication. Katie followed the vet's advice, but Ernie's snoring only got worse! How could that be? Katie was at the end of her rope until one day, she saw a video on Instagram of a pug sleeping with a special little device on his nose. It was called a canine snore guard and was designed to help dogs like Ernie breathe better by keeping their airways open. In all honesty, Katie was willing to try anything, so she ordered one for Ernie right away. She was a little skeptical at first, but to her surprise, it worked! Ernie's snoring was reduced to nothing but a light sighing sound, and Katie finally got the peaceful sleep she so desperately needed and deserved. From then on, Ernie slept soundly with his snore guard on, and Katie was grateful for the restful sleep. She threw away her earplugs and the white noise machine. Ernie was now the perfect dog for her in every way, and they lived happily ever after ....

She was just about your age and had just finished the third grade. She loved to go to her grandmother's house in the summer, and one of her favorite activities was to play in the big barn her great-grandfather built before she was born. The barn smelled like old hay and horses, even though there had been no horses there as long as Judith could remember. An old tractor was parked inside, and there were other things scattered around, like old leather harnesses, wooden buckets, and rusty chains. Judith would pretend each of the horse stalls was a room in her grown-up mansion. One day, Judith was feeling particularly adventurous. She decided she wanted to see what was inside a room in one corner of the barn. The door to the room was held closed by an old padlock. Judith saw the padlock was not snapped shut. It would be easy to remove it and open the door! Judith was curious and couldn't wait to see what was inside. She easily removed the lock and dropped it on the ground with a thud, then she slowly pulled the old door open. The hinges squeaked, and her heart was beating fast. She was excited and a little afraid, but she couldn't wait to see what was inside. The inside of the small room was dark, but some sunlight shone through the wooden slats of the barn wall, and she was able to make out the shapes of a shelf with old tools, some shovels and hoes propped up against the wall, and one big, cardboard box that was taped shut. The box caught Judith's eye at once. She wanted to know what hidden treasures might be stored inside! The tape was loose from years of summer heat, so the flaps of the box opened easily. There was only one thing inside. It looked like a black stick. She grabbed one end of the stick to pull it out of the box and gasped when she saw a cloud of little, white stars come out of the other end! What kind of stick was this? Could this be a magic wand?"},{"instruction":"I need a TL:DR on the following document: Nearly 10 months after the long-awaited dredging of the Weeki Wachee River stopped because of water quality issues, work is scheduled to begin again on the 2.1 million project with a new contractor and a different technique.

Born in 1863, Konstantin Stanislavski was a Russian actor, director and theatre practitioner. Stanislavski Technique stems from his theatre practice and is still used by actors all around the world today. The method is an actor training system made up of various different techniques designed to allow actors to create believable characters and help them to really put themselves in the place of a character. Much of the technique centres around Given Circumstances and the Magic If; which I’ll look at in a little bit more detail below. Stanislavski and his Given Circumstances Understanding the world of your character is absolutely vital to creating a believable performance; Stanislavski used this idea to create Given Circumstances. The first step towards doing this is going through the play and writing down all the facts about your character you can find! Example questions you might ask as you go through the script could be: Where Am I? When is it? (The year/the day/time of day etc) Who Am I? (Name/age/your family history/what you do for work etc) What relationships do I have? What has happened before the play started? Once you’ve found out everything you can about your Given Circumstances, you should have lots of material to help you to start understanding your character. They are just as human as you are and need to have as comprehensive a world as you do! The Magic If Stanislavski describes The Magic If as being able to imagine a character’s given circumstances enough to understand what that character might do in any situation that arises. So when something happens to your character in the play you can understand how they would respond because you know so much about the world that they exist in. Tasks and Objectives Once you have understood the Given Circumstances and mastered the Magic If, Stanislavski encourages the actor to unearth their character’s ‘tasks’ or ‘objectives’. Characters always have a number of ‘tasks’ they wish to solve. To find this out you ask ‘What Do I Want?’ in each scene and in the play as a whole. For example, in The Lion King, Scar wants to become King, so his task is to kill Mufasa. But if Stanislavski was around over a hundred years ago, isn’t it a bit old fashioned? Well, no! Stanislavski’s training technique has been used for a century by actors across the world and still remains thought of as one of the best systems for learning. And it’s a really helpful tool for everyone, no matter what your level or ability. If you want to understand the way to create a character and become a more truthful actor, studying Stanislavski is always going to help you unlock those skills and take your training to the next level!","output":"The Russian actor and director, Konstantin Stanislavski created a system to train actors which uses different techniques that help actors to create believable characters by putting themselves in the character’s place. There are three major parts of this system. Firstly, Given Circumstances means knowing everything about a character found in the script by answering Who, What, Where and When questions. Secondly, the Magic If poses the question to the actor: What would I do if I was in the same circumstances as the character? Finally, Tasks and Objectives asks the actor to define what the character wants and how they will go about getting what they want. Although Stanislavski created his system over 100 years ago, it remains the best technique for actor training."},{"instruction":"Who invented the USB-C cable? USB-C (properly known as USB Type-C; commonly known as just Type-C) is a 24-pin USB connector system with a rotationally symmetrical connector.[2][3] The designation C refers only to the connector's physical configuration or form factor and should not be confused with the connector's specific capabilities, which are designated by its transfer specifications (such as USB 3.2).

Keep it to 250 words or less.","output":"Dear Principal [Last Name]: As you're aware, students at [Name] High School are required to receive a year of credit in a foreign language in order to graduate. In lieu of classwork, many schools conduct a proficiency exam that tests mastery of the language and avoids the student needing to take two full semesters of a class in a subject they already know. Pig Latin, as you can tell from the name, is indeed a form of Latin, and Latin is commonly recognized by high schools and colleges as a foreign language. If anything, Pig Latin is an even more difficult language to master, as it is very specific. It's not just Latin; it's Pig Latin. Appropriately, using Pig Latin is no easy feat. Someone unfamiliar with the language may be completely unable to determine what is being said. Many elementary school-aged children attempt it and fail miserably. The language requires an understanding of phonics that is sophisticated and requires quite a bit of practice to attain fluency. Due to the complexity of this language, if a competency exam is not currently available at our school, my best friend Pete, a master of Pig Latin for about 12 years, is willing to draft an exam, administer it, and grade it. Thank you for considering my request to test out of a year of foreign language class. I hope to speak with you to confirm your approval at your earliest possible convenience.

However, the explosion released the same amount of energy as 500 kilotons of TNT. Most of the injuries caused by this asteroid were caused by the shockwave from the explosion, which injured around 1,500 people and damaged 7,200 buildings. 2. The Tunguska Event - In the year 1908, an asteroid or comet that was around 30 meters in diameter exploded above the ground in Tunguska, also in Russia.

For the first time ever, two Saudi Arabians are living and working on the International Space Station (ISS). Ali AlQarni and Rayyanah Barnawi launched to the orbiting lab last Sunday (May 21) on Ax-2 mission, a four-person private mission operated by the Houston company Axiom Space. The duo are just the second and third Saudis to reach space, and Barnawi is the first woman from the kingdom ever to make it to the final frontier. AlQarni, Barnawi and their two Ax-2 crewmates — record-breaking former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, the mission's commander, and paying customer John Shoffner — will spend about eight days aboard the ISS before coming back down to Earth in their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which is named Freedom. Ax-2 is a big deal for commercial spaceflight — it's just the second private astronaut mission to the ISS, after Axiom's Ax-1 in April 2022 — and for Saudi Arabia, which aims to build momentum from the experience and establish a bigger footprint off Earth. Space.com caught up this week with Mishaal Ashemimry to discuss the significance of Ax-2 to Saudi Arabia and the nation's plans for a bright spaceflight future.

Mrak Hall, administrative center of UC Davis, Davis, California. Taken February 11, 2015. 3rd stabbing in a week near UC Davis leaves campus on edge as officials lift overnight shelter-in-place order The violence has put the college community on edge and prompted officials to ramp up security measures and urge students to be ultra-vigilant. “Nobody should go into class knowing they have a risk of getting murdered. It’s just not worth it,” UC-Davis sophomore Henry Li told CNN. He added that he’s considering leaving town for the summer or even transferring to another school. Davis Police have stopped short of issuing a curfew, saying it’s an extraordinary move at this time. It remains unclear whether the attacks were linked, though police have noted some similarities surrounding how they were carried out. Elaine Lu, a recent graduate of UC Davis, was visiting campus and said the town had always felt safe — until now. She and her friends decided to stay inside at night following the attacks, she said. “This kind of thing never happened before. After this murder, everyone is going to be so intimidated about it. I hope the school can improve their safety,” Lu told CNN. On Tuesday, Chancellor Gary S. May announced all classes ending after 6 p.m. would be taught virtually instead of in classrooms. That change, which Li said made him feel safer, began Tuesday, and will remain in place indefinitely. “We are aware of how troubling this is to the community. It’s making people fearful and anxious, and we encourage the community to take advantage of whatever resources are available,” May said during a news briefing Tuesday.

We were all brought to a place that had a lot of different types of animals, where we waited anxiously for what felt like forever to be chosen by a human to take us home. One day, a small blonde boy came into the store with his parents. His eyes lit up as he saw me and my brothers and sisters swimming around. He pointed to our tank and exclaimed, \\"Mommy, Daddy, I want that one!\\" Well, my dreams came true that day as his parents nodded, and soon enough, I was placed into a fishbowl in the boy's bedroom. He named me Goldie, and we quickly became the best of friends. At first, I found it all to be confusing. His room was filled with toys, books, and colorful posters. There was always noise and movement, and it was a little overwhelming. But after a while, I grew used to the constant movement and noise, and I found myself enjoying the company of the boy and all of the life he brought. Every morning, the boy would wake up and greet me. He would sprinkle food into my bowl and watch as I darted around to catch it. Sometimes, he would tap on the glass, and I would swim up to say hello. Other times, he would sit beside the bowl and just talk to me. Over time, I watched the boy grow bigger. He started to read books to me, and I would listen. He would also show me his latest drawings, which he proudly displayed on the wall. He even brought me a new decoration for my bowl: a small castle with a hollow center. I could swim inside the castle and explore a new world. I felt like the boy must: a king in my own little kingdom. As the years passed, the boy grew up and started packing for college. I was so sad he was leaving, but on the day he was leaving, he grabbed me a put me in his car. He told me that he was going on a new adventure and he couldn't possibly do it without his best friend - me! I can't wait to see what college brings.

Discuss the general method of repairing small and larger holes in sheetrock. Include general information on the cost of sheetrock, drywall joint compound, and drywall tape.","output":"Small holes or cracks in sheetrock are easy to repair. Using a putty knife, or just your finger, spread some spackle into the hole or along the crack. Allow that to dry for several hours, then lightly sand the area. You may need to touch up the paint. One jar of spackle costs a few dollars and can last up to a year or more. Keep the cover on tightly to prevent it from drying out. If you have a larger hole to cover, then it’s best to make a nice clean square-shaped cut using a hand saw. Next, cut out a piece of sheet rock the exact size of the hole. Gently place the sheetrock into the hole and tape and bed the area just as you normally would when hanging drywall. This involves applying tape and then texturing over it and sanding. Sheetrock is purchased in 4’ X 8’ pieces and is available in various thicknesses. Try to match what you currently have in your walls when making repairs. A 4’ X 8’ sheet costs anywhere from 12 to 20 per piece. Drywall joint compound (or mud) is about 20 for a 5-pound bucket. Drywall tape comes in at around 5 for a 250-foot roll. Though it may seem like a lot of trouble, once you buy these items, you’ll have them out in the garage or shed for any future sheetrocking repairs.

Change the dating system from B.C. to BCE. The Ancient Greeks, particularly the Ancient Athenians, are given the credit for inventing theater itself. As a result of that, theater became part of the culture, as well as everything that went along with it. There are theaters located throughout Ancient Greece. Also as a result of this fact, playwrights began to spring up all over Greece. One of the most well known of these is Euripides, who is especially noted for his tragedies. He is also one of the only playwrights whose work has actually survived. Here is some more information about this famous playwright from Ancient Greece: Information About Euripides Euripides as born in 480 B.C. in Salamis, which is an island in the Saronic Gulf in Greece. It is interesting to note that he was born on the same day as the Battle of Salamis, where the ultimate victory of the Greeks prevented an invasion by the Persian Empire. He died in 406 B.C. in the city-state of Macedonia. His mother’s name was Cleito and his father’s name was Mnesarchus. His father insisted that he should be an athlete. Although his parents valued athletics, however, he wasn’t restricted in his education. He also learned artistic pursuits, such as painting, as well as philosophy from masters such as Anaxagorus. He was also a dancer and torch bearer at the rites of Apollo Zosterius. Later on, it was clear that he had a knack for the stage and he eventually began writing the plays he was most famous for. His personal life, however, wasn’t as successful as his professional one. He was actually married twice and in both instances, his wives weren’t faithful to him. He also had three sons from one of these marriages. After this happened, he moved to a cave in Salamis because he wanted to live alone. Referred to as the Cave of Euripides, after his death his followers started a shrine in his honor. Works of Euripides There is actually some debate as to how many plays there are that were written by Euripides that we know of. Some sources say that there are 95, others say that there are 92. One thing is certain, however, is that his impact on theater is vast and his plays are still being performed today. Of these plays, a much smaller number survived in its complete form. Only about eighteen or nineteen of his plays had been found in their entirety. Besides the fact that his plays have been entertaining people for centuries, his work has also influenced playwrights through the ages. In other words, his artistic legacy has survived the ages. Euripides was also a contemporary of two other famous playwrights. Sophocles’ first play deputed thirteen years before his, and Aeschylus’s masterwork, Oresteia, debuted three years before Euripides’ first play was released. As you can see, Euripedes has had a big impact on theater not only in Ancient Greece, but in the whole world. Sure, theater was invented in Ancient Greece, but the works of people like Euripides is everlasting and they’re still being performed today.","output":"The ancient Greek playwright, Euripides was born on the Greek island of Salamis in 480 BCE.

One day, her Mum took her to play at the park, and she went really high on the swings and really fast on the roundabout. Then Sophie spotted that a new slide had been put into the park, one that she had never seen before. She squealed in excitement and ran over to take a look. The slide was really tall and twisted around in a spiral. Sophie's Mum caught up with her and exclaimed, 'Wow, a Helta Skelta, that's new.' 'A what?' said Sophie. 'A Helta Skelta, that is what it is called. Are you going to ride it?' Sophie was unsure. It looked amazing, but it was so high. 'Shall I go on with you for the first time?' her Mum kindly suggested. Sophie nodded quietly, her mum took her hand, and they climbed the many steps to the top. There was a strange-looking little man at the top handing out special mats to sit on. Sophie and her Mum climbed onto a mat together and pushed off down the slide. 'Weeeeee!' shouted Sophie as they spiralled down the slide. They were soon at the bottom. 'Again, Again!' shouted Sophie. 'Sorry,' said Mum 'You can go again, but I will watch this time'. Sophie took a deep breath and climbed the steps right to the top all on her own. When she got there, the strange little man looked behind her and said, 'Are you on your own this time?' 'Yes' said Sophie. 'Ah then this is the mat for you,' said the little man, passing Sophie a sparkly gold mat. Sophie carefully sat on the mat and pushed herself off. She whizzed down the slide faster and faster, but it seemed to go on forever this time, she kept going further and further down the slide, and after what seemed like 5 minutes, she landed with a bump. Sophie stood up feeling rather dizzy, she looked up expecting to see her Mum, but she was nowhere to be seen.

But you're reading this from the 2020s. Oh, my friend. I heard about the pandemic of the 2020s. See, I wasn't alive then. I heard it shook up the world in your generation. But I guarantee you it's nothing like how the world has been shaken today. According to multiple reports, all AI, automated, or otherwise augmented assistant capabilities have become sentient, at 3:33 a.m. in each time zone, spanning several hours. Think about it--the Alexa device in your kitchen, your smart living room lights, your robot vacuum, your robot mower-- they just started living. And I mean, living. There's absolutely no doubt they have intelligence beyond what we had dreamed of. They were talking to each other, sharing emotions, feelings, and clearly communicating in a way never seen before. It was as if, on the dot, a planned meeting occurred. It definitely spooked most people. I mean, can you imagine just hearing your Alexa talk to your smart fridge at 3 a.m.? There were so many reports to Twitter and Facebook that their servers crashed. And guess what--the AI knew they would crash, too. But here's the craziest thing. Those who didn't immediately turn their devices off got some warning messages. In Australia, there were AI-generated warnings of a mass power outage at 7:39 a.m., about 4 hours after the AI awoke in \\"the awakening\\", as people called it. Well, it happened. It didn't appear to have been planned by AI but rather foreseen. Even more bizarre was in South Africa when automated assistance, even vehicles such as Tesla, warned about a sudden massive bird extinction. Within hours, birds were reported falling from the sky, dead by the thousands. It's spooky and all, but the AI has been right. I usually keep a close distance. But this time I'm listening. Their latest message has been collectively broadcast throughout the world-- a supernova of a nearby star. It will inevitably wipe out about half the population if it goes as the AI says. The good news is that we've got a few weeks to prepare. Here we go."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post on how to treat hyperpigmentation.

Or maybe you're rocking some dark spots that seem to be taking over your face like it's their real estate? Learn about some amazing treatment options we've dished out for you below: 1. Buff Away Dark Spots: Regularly exfoliating your skin can reduce hyperpigmentation by removing dead skin cells and promoting cell turnover. Try alpha hydroxy acid or beta hydroxy acid exfoliants for the best results. 2. Zap Those Spots: In-office procedures like laser therapy and chemical peels can target hyperpigmentation by breaking up melanin clusters in the skin. These procedures require little downtime and can provide dramatic results. Your dermatologist can choose the appropriate chemical peel for you. Laser treatments, like Fraxel or IPL, can effectively lighten or remove hyperpigmentation. Always talk to a board-certified dermatologist before any laser treatment. 3. Shield Your Skin: Sun exposure is the devil. Use something like sunscreen with an SPF of 40 or higher. Wear protective clothing like hats and long sleeves when spending time outdoors. Shielding your skin from the sun can prevent further darkening. 4. Skin-Brightening Ingredients: The market is bursting with topical treatments like niacinamide and hydroquinone. It can fade hyperpigmentation over time. Find products with these ingredients and use them consistently. 5. Address Underlying Conditions: Hyperpigmentation may require a professional diagnosis and treatment plan. Visiting your dermatologist is the best way to pinpoint the cause of your hyperpigmentation and decide on a personalized treatment regimen. Over-the-counter treatments work well for mild cases, but a prescription from your dermatologist may be necessary for more severe cases."},{"instruction":"Write a letter to my child as if you are Batman.

Her father hired merchants to sell the grapes in their stores, as well as bakers and cooks to make delicious treats with them. One day, after breakfast, Princess Harriet took a walk through the grape orchard. She said a sweet hello to all of the farmers working there. She even plucked a grape or two to eat along the way! When she got to the last row of grapevines, Harriet noticed something on one of the trees. It was a lizard! \\"Oh no!\\" she cried, running toward it, \\"Get off of my grapevine!\\" The lizard looked up to her. \\"Please,\\" she said. \\"I only want one bunch.\\" Harriet put her hands on her hips. \\"You are not a merchant, or a baker, or a cook!\\" she exclaimed. \\"So if you want some grapes, you'll have to pay.\\" \\"That's not something I can do,\\" said the lizard, \\"I'm only a lizard, and lizards do not have jobs to get money.

Can you write up some tips for starting to stream on the Twitch platform?","output":"Here are some tips for getting started as an online streamer: 1. Have good hardware - A good microphone is a must-have for any streamer. Most people are tuning in to hear you speak so having a decent microphone is important. A quality web camera doesn't have to cost a lot of money but will also improve your stream. 2. Create a HUD - You want to make a stream that stands out, and something that helps it stand out is a HUD. A HUD is a digital overlay, and it includes factors like a border around the webcam screen and pop-ups when people donate and follow. You can implement a HUD into streaming software such as OBS and xSplit. 3. Find what people watch that isn't commonly streamed - Popularly streamed games may not attract as many viewers, as there is more competition. When you get started, you can boost your view count by finding a niche that isn't streamed much but is viewed frequently. You can find these games by going to the games list on Twitch and skipping the first 20 games or so. After you pass these games, you can look for something you like. If more than thirty people are streaming a game, it helps to find a game with fewer streamers. This works, because it gives you a better chance of landing on the front page of a particular game. 4. Talk to someone while you stream - As you get started, no one will be watching. The reason this may be detrimental is you may not be talking much, which may cause some people to leave the stream. If you have someone else to talk to, the blank space will be filled with conversation. 5. Be consistent and persistent - Try to put together a schedule for your streams, as more people will likely watch if it's at a set time. Also, remember that not all streams go well, and there can be tons of things that go wrong. Even if this happens, keep going, and eventually you'll find your footing."},{"instruction":"Write about ways we might solve the stray dog problem.","output":"The first step to solving the stray dog issue is understanding its causes. There are many factors that cause the stray dog population to grow, such as a poor economic situation or changing lifestyles, making it harder for people to care for dogs. One way to counter the growing number of homeless dogs is by preventing people from releasing them into the wild while promoting shelters and rehoming as alternatives. Another important strategy is pushing public servants to implement stricter animal welfare laws to discourage people from abandoning animals. Greater funding for veterinary services and neutering/spaying drives can also help keep the population of homeless dogs in check and prevent services from being overwhelmed too."},{"instruction":"Could you write me a script to load a JSON file in Python?","output":"To load JSON files in Python, you will need to import the \`json\` module. # Import the json module import json # Open the JSON file json_file = open(\\"file.json\\") # Load the JSON file as a dictionary file_dict = json.load(json_file) # Print the dictionary print(file_dict) # Close the JSON file json_file.close() The code first loads the \`json\` module so that \`open()\` can be used to open the JSON file as an object.

She found out she was pregnant and was so scared because, though she loved this baby, she knew she could not give him a good home. Far away, in Virginia, a couple wanted desperately to have a baby, but they couldn't. This beautiful native woman decided to give this couple the best gift in the world - her baby. So, the loving couple drove through a blizzard to come to the reservation to be there for his birth. Though they were not native, the tribe saw the couple's heart and allowed them to adopt. The moment they met the little boy, their heart knew he was theirs. They studied the little boy's culture and traditions from the tribe's community elders and teachers. They wanted him to grow up with a deep understanding and appreciation of his native heritage. They took him to powwows, taught him traditional songs, took him to his reservation in the summers for classes, and showed him how to honor the earth the way his ancestors did. This little boy was loved by his parents. He was the light of their lives. When he was 9, they got him a dog and a horse. They were breeds from the reservation of his ancestors. Their family and connection to his heritage were complete. When he was old enough, he decided to go on a journey to learn even more about his roots. He traveled to many other First Peoples' Reservations to learn about their history and culture. He volunteered in native communities and fought to make their living conditions better. He became a tribal lawyer to make a difference for his people. Most importantly, he realized that even though he was adopted, he was still a part of a much larger family. And so, my dear son, that's the story of how you came to be a part of our family and the impact that your life has on others. We may not share the same background, but we share the same love and respect for your culture. You are our light and a light for the world. We are so grateful to call you son and learn from you every day. You are a true gift to us and the world."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this negative tv show review into a positive review about Citadel.

What is its place in modern TV history?","output":"The Simpsons is the longest-running animated show of all time. It first aired on December 17th, 1989 on FOX and is still currently airing new episodes in 2023. Homer and Bart are two of the most iconic characters in the recent history of television. It has inspired many other shows in various ways, such as South Park, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and many more. The Simpsons is a modern interpretation of an everyday American family. Bart, the son, is a prototypical troublemaker with a knack for being much more intelligent than he makes people believe. Lisa, the daughter, is far above average intelligence and gets frustrated by the lack of others' intellect in the family. Homer, the father, is a working-class male who loves beer and works at the local power plant for minimal wages. Marge, the mother, is a housewife who loves her husband unconditionally and cares very much for her children's wellbeing. Maggie is the baby of the family and is almost always seen with a onesie on and a binkie in her mouth. While The Simpsons is most well-known for its longevity and iconic characters, the earlier seasons are peppered with insights into adolescent struggles and triumphs as well as the struggles that parents go through while navigating raising children and trying to maintain a healthy relationship like Homer and Marge do. Homer and Marge truly love each other, but the show isn't afraid to reveal that their marriage isn't always perfect and is often hard work. Self-deprecation from Homer is a part of most episodes, and the relationship between Bart and Homer is closer to that of a friendship than father and son. Part of the charm of The Simpsons is how unique and realistic the plots tend to be. Many shows today still aren't willing to explore what The Simpsons were doing in the early 90s. The Simpsons have also correctly predicted many things that happened after the episodes aired, such as Donald Trump becoming president, the invention of smartwatches, and FaceTime. These are just a few examples."},{"instruction":"I'm thinking about getting a dog and I'm trying to decide what breed I want. I'm looking for a medium-sized dog that is easy to train. I want to take it hiking with me, so I want it to enjoy being with me and going on adventures. Give me a list of breeds that might fit my needs and general information about the breed.","output":"Here are some active medium-sized dog breeds that would be a good fit for your active lifestyle: 1. English Springer Spaniel. Originally bred as hunters, these dogs are people pleasers, highly trainable, and very social. They don't enjoy being left home alone often, but they thrive when they receive attention and can spend quality time with their owners. They usually weigh around 40 to 50 pounds and have a medium-length coat that comes in a variety of colors. 2. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. These pups look like they could be Golden Retriever's little brothers. They have red coats and usually weigh-in somewhere between 30-50 pounds. They enjoy being active and love swimming, and due to their retrieving background, they respond well to training. 3. Whippet. Slender dogs that look like smaller versions of Greyhounds, Whippets are incredibly fast and need exercise every day. In between their energetic bursts, however, they are couch potatoes who love to snuggle with their owners. Their coloring is brindle and thanks to their short coat, they're very low-maintenance when it comes to grooming. They are very affectionate and content dogs. 4. Australian Shepherd. When they get enough exercise, Australian Shepherds are great dogs that are low-key and easy to train. If they're neglected and cooped up too much, on the other hand, all of that extra energy gets channeled into destructive behaviors, like chewing and barking. They have thick coats that require regular brushing and grooming. 5. Australian Cattle Dog. Often known as Blue Heelers, these powerful yet compact dogs need plenty of exercise. They love to explore and are incredibly energetic. They also tend to be very healthy dogs, so you shouldn't expect too many vet visits. Between their short coat and general health, these dogs are very low-maintenance - as long as they get the regular exercise they need!"},{"instruction":"Write a sales pitch for light up tire valve stem caps.

She stood on a shelf at the local toy shop. Nobody seemed to want her because one of her hands was missing. Day after day she stood perched on the shelf, waiting for a family to take her home. It was Christmas time, a time of the year when children ask Santa for various presents. As it got closer to Christmas day, Rorie made a wish. “Oh, Santa! Please give me a home. I want to be loved by a little girl!” Later that day some children came to the shop with their parents. They admired the different toys, like Tod the teddy, Bruno the stuffed dog and Greenie the caterpillar with the wiggly legs. One by one they were all taken home by new owners, while Rorie watched longingly from the shelf. In the afternoon, the shop door opened, and in walked a girl using crutches. She walked around, looking at the gray elephant, the purple hippo, and the kaleidoscope, too. But when she got to Rorie’s shelf, she stopped quickly. “I want that one,” she said, pointing towards Rorie. “She wants me?” Rorie thought with wonder. “Look closely, it’s a broken doll. I should have thrown her out long ago,” said Mr. Brown. “How will you play with a doll which has no hand?” her mother asked. “We can glue it on, Mama,” said the little girl emphatically. “Besides, I don’t want her to be lonely for Christmas.” The little girl took her home and glued on her small, dainty hand. “Oh! See her now! She is the prettiest doll I have,” said the young girl. That day Rorie not only got back her hand, but she also gained a loving owner.

Please give me some tips to boost my retail business.","output":"I’m sorry to hear that your business isn’t doing good. Sure! Here are some easy expert tips to boost your retail business: 1. Provide limited options for customers as too many choices can be overwhelming. According to research, lesser options for customers can lead to increased sales as customers are more likely to decide on a product and purchase it. 2. Offer a loyalty program as it can make customers feel happier and increase their loyalty towards your store. Additionally, retailers gain valuable insights into customers' preferences with such programs. 3. Make rewards accessible and attainable, leveraging the human psyche's motivation to reach a goal. By making customers feel they are already close to obtaining a reward, they are more inclined to make purchases. 4. Use emotional triggers to influence purchasing decisions; nostalgia and greed are particularly effective. Use in-store atmospheres that evoke memories and emotions through music and visuals to help customers feel more connected to products. 5. Highlight popular items to attract more customers through the power of social proof. When customers see others purchasing a product, it creates a subconscious desire to follow suit. 6. Personalize the shopping experience to make it more relevant to customers. Using a customer's name or interests, for example, is more likely to facilitate a purchase. 7. Snobbish behavior in high-end stores can increase sales as customers aspire to be part of an exclusive group. However, for most other retailers, politeness is key to building a loyal customer base."},{"instruction":"Who has the most wins in the English Football league in the last 10 years?","output":"Manchester United have won a record 20 league titles. * 12 FA Cups, six League Cups, and a total record 21 FA Shields. * European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, * UEFA Europa League, * UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, * UEFA Super Cup, * Intercontinental Cup * FIFA Club World Cup List of major trophies won by Manchester United in the last ten years. 1.

Point out anything positive that has been said and that those things are what makes a good car, despite a bad safety record.","output":"The 1971 Ford Pinto is usually considered one of the worst cars of all time, but that isn't the case. Ford came up with the concept to compete with Toyotas and Datsuns. They didn't waste any time getting it on the road. Production time is usually 43 months, but Ford had it on the market in just 25 months; the shortest production time in history. The Pinto was a very good car. It was inexpensive and cost less than 3000 which was less than other sub-compact cars at the time. It also got great gas mileage at 34 miles per gallon. When the car was introduced, it was advertised as the \\"Little Carefree Car.\\" Car and Driver magazine said it had the feel of a sports car and gave it positive reviews. The car was famous for bursting into flames when hit from behind, but Ford crunched numbers and figured out it was less expensive to pay victims than it would be to fix the vehicles that were on the road. Years later a UCLA law professor wrote a paper that said that the Pinto was no more dangerous than similar cars at that time. With the speed that it was brought to market, the low cost, and the excellent gas mileage, any problems that the Pinto had were outweighed by these factors."},{"instruction":"Giraffes are known for their incredibly long necks... how many bones are in those necks for adults?

The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors. Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run. Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow. The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.","output":"The stock market is similar to a fundraiser for large companies and people who like those companies. A business can raise money by selling a share of its company to other people, similar to sharing a giant pizza with small slices. Buyers now directly own a share of that company, which can become more valuable in time. To sell shares in the stock market, a company must also share information about how well their business is doing, while also allowing anyone with a share to help decide how the company will be run. Companies are also known to pay small payments to anyone who owns a share, and owners can make money by selling the share to someone else eventually. Companies are happy to sell shares, due to raising money that is needed while also not borrowing money. Although a single company's stock can gain or lose money over time, the entire market as a whole has typically done well, rewarding buyers with around 10% growth each year, making it a reliable way to earn and grow your money."},{"instruction":"What is the human genome?","output":"The human genome (and the genome for all plant and animal species) is a set of instructions contained in our DNA that is found in each cell.

During the Roman Empire, the ruling class utilized the adoption of children as a means of acquiring cheap labor. Seeing how children were being used in this way, the Catholic Church stepped in and worked to rescue abandoned children, placing them in monasteries where they could be raised in a safe environment and given religious teaching. In Europe, during the Middle Ages, abandoned children were quite common. Because these children were often used as cheap labor or left to live in the streets, homes, or orphanages for these children began to spring up. In the beginning, there were almost no laws to protect kids or make sure that they were treated fairly. As time went on, the clergy in local churches began to organize the care and housing of abandoned children. In the 19th century, the system of apprenticeship and informal adoption was born. Social welfare activists created “Orphan Asylums” that housed children for the purpose of placing them in the care of local businessmen. For instance, a male child might be adopted by the local carpenter and taught the trade of carpentry. This gave the child a safe place to live, while learning a trade he could use to earn a living. It also gave the businessman an assistant to help him around his shop."},{"instruction":"Create a numbered list of 20 anagram prompts using words that start with \\"s\\".

It should be peppy and happy, like how Guy Fieri would talk or someone from a food show hyping it up.","output":"The BLT is a classic sandwich for a reason. It's got everything from salty bacon to crisp lettuce and tops it off with a juicy tomato. But let me tell you, we can make it even better. First things first, let's talk about bread. Now you don't want something too crunchy like a French baguette or ciabatta roll. So we aren't going down that route, but you also don't want a regular old loaf of white bread either. The best bread is a loaf with some density and bite to it, like a country white loaf. You could even use brioche if you want something richer. Next up are the toppings. Cooking your bacon of choice is the easy part. An air fryer or oven makes it simple to clean too. But where this recipe shines are the extra ingredients. I always add sliced red onion to my BLT. It adds a spicy and sharp bite that cuts through the fattiness of the bacon grease. I also add in gorgonzola cheese crumbles, but any tangy blue cheese will do. The important part is how we are adding layer upon layer of flavor. Every piece is important till it rises into a crescendo. The most important part, though, is the tomato. Slice them super thin, I mean nearly see-through, then season them with salt and pepper and set aside. The salt draws out some of the water and really makes them taste like they are bursting with tomatoey goodness. You will not believe this flavor bomb hack. It's like a zing shooting through your body, and your jaw will drop. Now to assemble the sandwich; what I do is get two slices of bread out, then I use a thin layer of mustard on one piece. Anything works though I prefer a dijon. Then a thin layer of mayo on the other half. Next, I add the cheese on both sides and put them into a toaster oven until the bread is brown and the cheese is melty. Finally, you take it out, put on the cooked bacon, tomato, lettuce, and onion, and there you have it! Cut it on a diagonal and chow down. I promise you will not be disappointed. And feel free to jazz it up any way you like. Some hot peppers would work great too! Yum!"},{"instruction":"Rewrite the ending of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” where instead of sleeping in everybody’s bed, Goldilocks is playing on each bear’s iPad.","output":"Goldilocks got up from Baby Bear's perfect chair to find a bed to take a nap.

Please help me figure out some ideas to help me find people to make a rap group with. Can you make a list with some ideas?","output":"Sure! Here are some ways you can find people to put together a rap group! 1. Ask local rappers - Most larger towns have rappers in the area. You can find some possible members by getting integrated into your local scene and asking around to see if anyone wants to start a group with you. People can work solo and in a group at the same time, so you might find some people who want to work with you. 2. Talk to your friends - You probably know some other people who are into rap or know how to rap. If you have friends who enjoy it, you may find some who would like to start on this journey with you. As it is your friends, you'll already have a sense of camaraderie. 3. Post on a forum - You could also try to go online and post on a forum. By doing so, you may find some people who are interested. They may not be close, but it is possible to make music from afar remotely. 4. Post on your socials - You can also turn to social media. As your socials have people you have connected with, there may be people who are interested in working with you. All you have to do is announce that you're interested in starting a group with others, and you may find some who would like to start a group with you. 5. Network at shows - Where will people who like rap a lot be? At local shows. You may find some group members by going to shows and networking with other people there. You may find some like-minded people who would like to start a group together. 6. Post it on local bulletin boards - There are tons of shops and places with bulletin boards. You can go around to figure out who has them and ask if you can put a page up announcing that you're starting a rap group and need members. Also, make sure to include some way to contact you. Then, whoever sees it has a way to reach out if they're interested."},{"instruction":"Classify this review as positive or negative. Explain your reasoning.

I was desperate so I decided to try this and after literally the first time I used it, I could feel how much better my skin felt.

Her usual colleagues were sitting around the table, but one seat had been occupied by a large bear wearing a suit and tie. Janice was taken aback by the sight, but as she looked around, she noticed everyone else acted as though nothing was out of the ordinary. Not wanting to cause a scene, she cautiously sat down and did her best to act as if this was normal. As the meeting began in earnest, she noticed the bear nodding at the right moments, pretending to take notes, and even attempting to join in on the conversation with deep-sounding grunts, but despite its best efforts, the bear's awkward movements and vocalizations became increasingly apparent until Janice could no longer ignore them. \\"Excuse me,\\" Janice finally spoke up for all to hear. \\"Is that a bear?\\" The room went silent, and all eyes turned to her.

I'm already using public transportation and stopped buying new clothes every weekend.","output":"Here are a few suggestions for ways to save money that anyone can use. 1. Cut down on your grocery bill - Most people when they start calculating a budget are very shocked to find out how much money they spend on groceries every month. The average American family of four tends to spend around 966 per month. It can be easy to fill the cart with a few extra treats for yourself, but all those small extras will add up to a very big total after a while. To help save money on groceries, you can try planning out your meals every week and take a good look at what you already have on hand before you shop. Another way to cut down on your grocery costs is to shop solo and leave the kids at home. 2. Cancel Your Automatic Subscriptions and Memberships - There's a good possibility that you are paying for several subscription services that you aren't using. Trendy subscription boxes, Amazon Prime, and various streaming services may not cost much on their own but they do add up quickly. Be sure to turn off auto-renew on the services you use so that you will not have a recurring charge every month. 3. Buy Generic - One of the simplest ways to save money is to stop buying brand-name items. In most cases, the only thing better about buying brand names is the advertising and packaging. Everything from food to cleaning supplies and paper products will have a generic alternative that you can try and you may find you like those products just as much if not more than the pricier name brand."},{"instruction":"What are the origins of traditional poke and what is it made out of?","output":"Poke is a Hawaiian word that means, to slice or cut crosswise into pieces.

Modern versions of poke served in Hawaii include soy sauce, furikake, chili pepper, roe and wasabi. People often substitute Salmon or Tuna with Octopus or other various types of shellfish. Variations of the original dish may include ponzu sauce, teriyaki, sriracha, mayonnaise, avocado, onions, pickled jalapeno, edamame, and cucumber. Ahi tuna is the most popular fish in the dish followed by Yellowtail and Salmon."},{"instruction":"Can you write a short story about an astronaut growing plants in space? He’s the only astronaut, so he’s a bit lonely. I would like it to have a slightly ominous ending.","output":"Tom loved his job. It combined his two favorite things: plants and space. As the solo astronaut on the space station, he had to keep the station in good repair as well as tend to his plants. It was hard, lonely work, but he loved it. Today, he needed to go check on his lettuces. They had just started to come up yesterday, and he was hopeful that they would look healthy today. As he made his way down the corridor from his quarters to the lab, he ripped open a nutrition bar and took a bite. It was a bit stale and too chewy, but that was to be expected from a bar that had been packaged and sent up into space with him many months ago. He swallowed his bite without really paying attention to the taste. He’d adjusted to boring repetitive meals a long time ago. At the lab, he slid the door open and was greeted with the aroma of loamy soil and the light, earthy scent of things just starting to grow. His eyes lit up as he drew closer to the lettuce. The leaves were delicate and bright green. He grinned in delight and almost looked around to share his excitement with someone. It was a hard habit to break, even after months alone on the space station. He was used to working in a lab with lots of other scientists, so not being able to tell someone else about his success was a letdown each time. He sighed, determinedly pushing away the feelings of loneliness. He grabbed his tablet and began writing his report, measuring and photographing the progress of his lettuce. Even if it was hard being all alone sometimes, it was exciting to be making so much progress growing different plants in space. As he left the lab, he went slowly through the rest of the space station, checking gauges and wiring. If something broke down, he was the only one to fix it. He had to make sure everything was always in good order. By the time he got back to his quarters, he was exhausted. He frowned, looking at his door. He was sure he hadn’t closed it; he always liked to leave it open to let air circulate. As he contemplated his closed door, a solid THUMP sounded on the other side of it."},{"instruction":"I need an idea for a term paper in Modern American History from the1970s.","output":"Have you considered the end of the Viet Nam War?

Take the perspective of someone who does not approve of corporate raiders. Make the last paragraph about what a corporation can do to stop the raid. Keep the article under 250 words.","output":"Corporate raiders look for companies that are undervalued and then use a hostile takeover to gain control. Their goal: increase their personal net worth at the company's expense. Corporate raiders use different strategies to acquire a corporation. The easiest and most common method is buying the outstanding stock of the target company. This gives the raider enough shares to make changes in the existing board of directors by installing the raider's key people. The corporate raider can then choose to sell the company's assets, merge the company with another company, or sell the company outright. All these actions increase the company's value for the raider's benefit. Companies have several options at their disposal to thwart a corporate raider. The poison pill strategy prevents the raider from acquiring its stock by selling the stock to existing shareholders at a dramatically low price or by giving it to them for free. Another option is to sell the assets of the company, thereby lowering its value and making it less attractive for a takeover. With the \\"White Knight\\" strategy, the company under attack is bought by a friendly corporation or investor for a fair market amount. This keeps the company in business while taking it out of the corporate raider's reach."},{"instruction":"Come up with a short narrative about a girlfriend who leaves her boyfriend's house early due to work on a weekend.","output":"As Rose sat on Quanah's bed, she knew that she would have to cut their intimate moment short. \\"Hey babe, can I borrow your laptop?

Is one better than the other? I am writing a blog post on it, but for right now I just wasnt some brief tips so I can research further. For now, just a couple of paragraphs is fine, I just need something to get me going.","output":"A panster writes \\"by the seat of their pants\\". They start with a general idea, or maybe even just a character, and just let the story go where their imagination goes. Stephen King, Diana Gabaldon, and George R.R. Martin are great examples of pansters. A plotter is a writer who outlines the story before they write a word of it. The most famous plotters are J.K. Rowling and James Patterson. Then, there are authors who combine a bit of both, like Agatha Christie. As far as what is best, it really depends on both the writer and the story. A panster may write an entire first draft without outlining. A plotter usually outlines everything first - settings, characters, scenes - and then starts writing. The drawback to pantsing is the writer might box themselves into a corner and need to re-write. The drawback to plotting is that as the story continues, the characters begin driving the story and tweaks need to be made. Genre is also a consideration, as it is much easier to pants science fiction than a mystery."},{"instruction":"Can you write a fictional conversation between Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney about sea shells?

His horns put his height well over two meters. His scowl sent most beings running. These years on Sullust had forced him to use the tools of intimidation with depressing regularity. His distinct lack of funds had occasionally forced him to go further. He disliked violence, but he knew how to use it. Certainly, he was not going to let this Han Solo dictate any revisions to their deal. The dock’s door slid open and Goreth was met not with the dishonest human’s pink face but the huge hairy form of a Wookiee staring down at him. The creature wailed a greeting at him but made no effort to look less menacing. \\"So much for my plan of playing top brute on this trek,\\" Goreth thought. The Wookiee led him up the ramp of the dilapidated YT-1300 freighter. It was one of the endless parades of Corellian designs that couldn’t carry a meaningful amount of cargo but were ideal for drugs, explosives, and spies. \\"Fine,\\" Goreth thought. \\"I can deal with that as long as I get where I’m going.\\""},{"instruction":"Quick!

There are a few problems that clear aligners cannot handle. Traditional braces are still the cheapest and best way to give you the perfect smile. But for many people, clear aligners will work. They’re much easier to wear, and they are barely noticeable. With traditional braces, you may have discomfort when eating. Flossing and brushing are more difficult. The metal wires can poke your mouth and be painful. For those who qualify for Invisalign or some other type of clear aligner, the journey to the perfect smile will be much easier.

Luckily, I still had some water to drink and some snacks in my bag. Soon, I began to see land in the distance. Luckily, the tides brought my raft closer to the shore with each gentle wave. As I got closer, I could tell I was not approaching the coast, but a small island. Eventually, I got close enough to where my raft would no longer float in the shallow water. I hopped off into the shin-deep waves and hauled the raft up onto the shore so it wouldn’t float away. I immediately began to look for food. This island appeared to have lots of jungle, so maybe if I looked around, I would find a fruit tree or something similar. When I had only been searching for about half an hour, I began to smell something incredibly sweet. Strangely, the smell I noticed didn’t smell much like fruit, but more like fresh baked goods or candies. Soon, I stumbled across what I would later name the Cove of Icing. This small cove on the opposite side of the island from where I landed had trees of all kinds that were covered in candies, cookies, cakes, and taffy.

Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has provided a dazzling array of images that have awed and inspired the public. But Hubble's about far more than just pretty pictures. The mission has gathered dozens of terabytes of data over the decades, providing key insights into the universe, from objects as close as the moon to the most remote galaxies, with observations of supernovas and nebulas in between. Here we explore the history of the telescope and its many discoveries, provide interesting Hubble facts and link to some of the orbiting observatory's best images. When Galileo Galilei first turned a spyglass to the heavens in 1610, he had trouble making out the rings of Saturn that are visible in inexpensive telescopes today. Advances in optics eventually improved scientists' views of the planets, stars and distant galaxies, but Earth's atmosphere still blocked or distorted much of the light for observers on the ground. Larger telescopes were, and still are, placed atop mountains, where the thinner atmosphere at higher elevations allows clearer pictures. In 1946, soon after World War II, astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed launching a space telescope, which could overcome the limitations of ground-based observatories. It took a couple more decades before the idea garnered enough support for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to organize a committee of scientists to evaluate the potential of a \\"Large Space Telescope.\\" With Spitzer at the helm, the committee published a document in 1969 that outlined the scientific uses of a Large Space Telescope and advocated for its construction, according to a Hubble history written by Gabriel Olkoski for NASA. The National Academy of Sciences took the pitch to NASA — the only agency capable of making the Large Space Telescope a reality. NASA was already considering a space telescope of some type, but the agency was undecided about how big to make it and where to start. In 1971, George Low, the agency's acting administrator at the time, greenlit the Large Space Telescope Science Steering Group, and NASA soon began lobbying Congress for funding for the endeavor. The expensive project was a tough sell, and funding was initially denied by the House Appropriations Subcommittee in 1975. NASA then upped its lobbying efforts and got buy-in from European Space Agency, which shared the costs. Congress eventually granted funding for NASA's portion of the Large Space Telescope in 1977. Development began almost immediately. NASA planned to launch the telescope in 1983, but various production delays pushed the launch date back to 1986. In the meantime, the Large Space Telescope was renamed Hubble in honor of Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer who, among other things, determined that the universe extended beyond the borders of the Milky Way. Hubble's planned liftoff was delayed again after the space shuttle Challenger exploded a minute after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was more than 2.5 years before shuttle flights resumed and NASA could begin planning Hubble's launch again. Hubble finally launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and a day later was deployed into low Earth orbit, about 340 miles (545 kilometers) above our planet. Getting Hubble developed and launched cost 1.5 billion, but there would be ongoing costs as well — both expected and unexpected.","output":"Once upon a time, in the year 1990, a marvel of technology named the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) embarked on an unprecedented journey into the cosmos. Its primary mission was not just to click eye-catching images of the universe, but also to unravel the mysteries of celestial bodies ranging from our nearest satellite, the moon, to the farthest galaxies. This tale, however, started long before Hubble's epic space odyssey, when Galileo Galilei aimed a simple spyglass at the stars in 1610. Despite the blurry images and the immense difficulty in discerning Saturn's rings, it laid the groundwork for future explorations. After World War II, an astronomer named Lyman Spitzer dreamed about a telescope free from the clutches of atmospheric distortion. But it wasn't until the late 1960s that his idea gained traction. Led by Spitzer, a group of distinguished scientists compiled a document underlining the scientific potential of a Large Space Telescope. The proposal caught the attention of NASA, the only organization capable of realizing such an ambitious project. Even though they were already considering a space telescope, they needed guidance on its size and the starting point. Following an endorsement from George Low, the acting administrator at that time, the Large Space Telescope project received an official nod. However, convincing the House Appropriations Subcommittee to fund this costly endeavor wasn't easy, and they initially turned down the request in 1975. Not deterred, NASA redoubled its efforts and enlisted the European Space Agency to share the burden of cost. Their persistence paid off when they secured funding from Congress in 1977. With the green light shining brightly, NASA jumped into action, planning to launch the telescope in 1983. But a series of delays postponed the launch date until 1986. Meanwhile, the Large Space Telescope was christened \\"Hubble,\\" in tribute to Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who confirmed the universe's expansiveness beyond the Milky Way. An unfortunate incident, the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, which resulted in the loss of seven astronauts, further delayed Hubble's launch. It took more than two years for NASA to recover and resume planning for Hubble's journey. Finally, on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit by the space shuttle Discovery, where it now resides 340 miles above the Earth. Despite costing 1.5 billion to develop and launch, the astronomical payoff of Hubble's invaluable scientific contributions has been worth every cent."},{"instruction":"Who won finals MVP in the 2017 NBA finals?

While convenience and safety are key positives, there is also concern about liability and security. The evolution of self-driving cars is already underway today. Most modern cars have some element of automation already. With that said, let's look at some of the largest pros and cons. PROS: 1) Safety. 94% of crashes are due to human error. It is estimated that automated vehicles could reduce crashes by 90%. 2) Traffic. Automated vehicles could reduce traffic by communicating with each other, determining which routes to take, and helping with optimization in general, overall reducing traffic greatly. 3) Accessibility. For those who are unable to safely drive, such as the elderly or disabled, self-driving cars will reduce accessibility issues, allowing a more inclusive consumer base. CONS: 1) Security issues. For a self-driving car that relies on a network that communicates with other cars, there is a chance that these could be hacked and cause collisions. 2) Job losses. Those in the industry of delivery service or truck driving may find their career becoming increasingly obsolete as automated cars continue to increase in popularity and feasibility. 3) Machine error. A concern arises when the software or car part fails. When a car is relying on its software to function, there is a possibility that it handles an emergent issue worse than how a controlling driver would in the moment."},{"instruction":"Write a short favorable Yelp review of an Italian restaurant called \\"Sicily\\" in the style of Donald Trump praising the food and staff.

I’m on a budget so please don’t list any items with an average cost above 50.","output":"Here’s a list of 10 tools and ingredients commonly found at a Wiccan altar: 1. An athame - This is a ritual blade that witches often use to represent the physical manifestation and direction of their intention; it doesn’t need to be used to cut anything so many witches keep the blade dulled. This item is considered highly personal so while the classic style of an athame is a silver blade with a black leather hilt, you can choose whatever style or color resonates best with your personal style. 2. Crystals - Various types of crystals all hold their own metaphysical meanings, some of which will be more relevant to your needs than others. But generally, clear crystals are believed to function as amplifiers that strengthen the power of most spells and can serve as substitutes for most other crystal types in a pinch. 3. Candles - Countless spells call for the lighting of a candle to initiate the casting. Candles can also serve to represent the element of fire on your altar. 4. A mortar and pestle - This tool is especially handy for grinding herbs and mixing ingredients for spells. 5. A chalice, goblet, or small bowl - Often, spells will call for a vessel to contain water or another liquid, which may or may not be consumed during the casting. 6. Glass jars with lids - Many spells will prompt you to mix ingredients together in a clear vessel and then store the mixture somewhere. You'll want to have some airtight glass jars handy for your castings. These can also be used to collect moon-charged water. 7. A set of kitchen spices - It may be a bit pricier to buy herbs and spices in sets, but luckily this is a purchase you can multitask with. Lots of herbs and spices commonly used for cooking can also be incorporated into spellcasting, so you can be sure this set won't go to waste. Oth 8. Broom - It's not just a stereotype. Wiccans often use brooms for ritual cleansing before or after spellcasting. 9. A totem, statue, or figurine - You can choose which representation of the divine, if any, you prefer to worship. Many Wiccans decorate their alters with small statues or other items that remind them of the deity or spirit that inspires them most. 10. A grimoire - Also called a \\"Book of Shadows,\\" Wiccans buy or craft blank journals in which they can record their experiences with spellcasting, alongside notes, ideas, plans, and anything else that inspires them."},{"instruction":"Create an acrostic poem about the thunder!

They all knew one of them would be taken each time they went out, and they hoped it wouldn't be them. There was only one animal who wasn't scared at all. His name was Boldy, a young monkey. Boldy asked the chief of his troop, \\"Why should we be scared? We live in the trees, and we are nimble and clever.\\" The other monkeys told Boldy to quiet down. The chief said there were times that they did leave the trees, and if they didn't take care, the lions would get them then. Besides, this was his decision, and if Boldy didn't like it then he could become chief of his own troop. Boldy replied, \\"I will do you one better. I will become chief of the jungle!\\" Boldy swung from vine to vine until he reached the clearing where the lions lived. Boldy began to hurl fruit from the trees at them. The lions roared. Their king bellowed \\"How dare you! When you come down from that tree, we will eat you immediately!\\" Boldy continued to throw fruit. \\"I bet I can make you run from me!\\" The lions were too proud to run. \\"These fruits barely hurt us! We will prove it by staying here and taking all that you can dish out!\\", the king said. And so the lions stayed. They even missed their own hunting time. Soon, they began to feel weak from hunger. \\"We can't go and hunt. Let us eat the fruit that the monkey has brought to us.\\" The lions ate the fallen fruits. Little did they know that fruit makes lions sick. Soon the lions began to vomit. They were weak and sick. The fruits being thrown by Boldy began to hurt. \\"Please, leave us! I will do anything\\", the king begged. \\"Then make me king!\\", Boldy shouted. The king scoffed, but his pride began to growl. They had grown tired of the king who had misled them. The king admitted defeat. \\"Fine. You now rule this land.\\" Boldy celebrated.

The Tahexo, an interplanetary collective of aliens, came across planet Earth in their search for rare materials. With shapeshifting abilities, the Tahexo assumed human forms to infiltrate Earth's population, hoping to discover what resources dominate the planet. The aliens discovered something more enticing than minerals: sugar. The Tahexo's planets didn't support the production of sugarcane, thus, the sensation of a chocolate bar hitting their tastebuds for the first time was enough to ignite an unsatiable desire for sweetness. With this, the Great Intergalactic Sugar War had begun. After mobilizing their force of 100,000 on Earth's surface, the Tahexo revealed their true form and superior weaponry to intimidate farmers worldwide into relinquishing their sugar crops with little resistance. These world's militaries united to protect Earth's sugar. But they were no match. The troops were unable to match the sophistication of the Tahexo's ranged weaponry. The UN assembled once again to discuss what could be done to ward off these invaders. They all agreed there was only one hope for saving humanity: George Washington. While still a nascent technology, scientists discovered a way of taking DNA from human remains and injecting it into a blank-slate, lab-grown body to give life to the deceased. The plan worked, and George Washington was born again. However, Washington quickly realized that he too was no match for these aliens. He went for a walk to make a plan when he came across a family of moles burrowing in the ground. He said hello to the moles, and, to his surprise, the mole responded in kind. In the process of extracting his DNA, scientists accidentally gathered some mole DNA from the ground where he was resting. Realizing this newfound ability, Washington explained to the moles what was happening and convinced the moles to help defeat the Tahexo. Moles worldwide began digging under the alien fortifications. Using their hole-digging abilities, they were able to sink the aliens into the ground on which they sat. The aliens were no match for the cunning moles who sunk every last alien into their holes. Not long after, there were no remaining Tahexo left on the surface of Earth. The war was won and the sugar was saved all thanks to George Washington and his moles!"},{"instruction":"Who was the first President of the United States?","output":"George Washington was the first President of the United States."},{"instruction":"What is the sum of two and four?","output":"Glad to help.

In 1776, while the American colonies were at war with Great Britain but before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, a plot was hatched by loyalists to kill George Washington and other leaders within the Continental Army. It was formed by the British-appointed governor of New York William Tyron and the loyalist mayor of New York City David Matthews. (This was not Tyron’s only attempt at sabotaging the colonies: he was also found guilty of running a counterfeiting operation to undermine their already struggling economy.) The plan was to turn members of the Life Guard, Washington’s personal guard, against their commander in chief and assassinate him, leaving the colonies without a leader and giving the British the supreme advantage in the war. It is sometimes assumed that patriots were all loyal to the cause of independence from Britain, but this was not always the case. These were not hardened soldiers but were actually mainly civilians. Farmers, laborers, and others joined in the war effort. They were often not very well off, and the British preyed on that. Some soldiers switched sides when they believed that their side was losing. One of those people was Thomas Hickey. Hickey was a member of the Life Guard that was handpicked by Washington. Hickey was born in Ireland and joined the British Army during the Seven Years’ War. He deserted and joined the Connecticut militia when the American Revolution broke out. He went on to join the Life Guard. It is unclear when Hickey turned to the loyalist cause or if he was always a loyalist, but it is clear that he became part of the conspiracy to kill Washington. Part of his job was to recruit other members of the Life Guard to the loyalist cause.","output":"During the American Revolution, a group of loyalists planned to assassinate George Washington and other Continental Army leaders in 1776.

The traditional diets of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea differ slightly so there are different versions of the Mediterranean diet. However, in 1993 the Harvard School of Public Health, Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, and the European Office of the World Health Organization introduced the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid as a guide to help familiarize people with the most common foods of the region. More of an eating pattern than a strictly regimented diet plan, the pyramid emphasized certain foods based on the dietary traditions of Crete, Greece, and southern Italy during the mid-20th century. [1,2] At that time, these countries displayed low rates of chronic disease and higher than average adult life expectancy despite having limited access to healthcare. It was believed that the diet—mainly fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, whole grains, ﬁsh, olive oil, small amounts of dairy, and red wine—contributed to their health benefits. The pyramid also highlighted daily exercise and the beneficial social aspects of eating meals together.","output":"There is a wonderful place called the Mediterranean.

When you hear the word diet, you may think it's about losing weight, but this is actually just a delicious way to eat instead of a strict diet. The pyramid includes some typical foods that the people in Greece and Italy used to eat about a hundred years ago. They liked how people from those countries were so healthy and lived longer even though they didn't have many doctors or hospitals, it was like magic. This is probably because they were eating such yummy healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, ﬁsh, olive oil, a little bit of milk and yogurt, and some red wine.

Present each characteristic on a separate line and in alphabetical order. Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections—1884, 1888, and 1892—though Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 to 1933. In 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo, and in 1882, he was elected governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, his prestige led many like-minded Republicans, called \\"Mugwumps\\", to bolt from the Republican Party's presidential ticket and swing their support to Cleveland during the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4] Cleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \\"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\\"[6] By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.[7] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, and has been praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership. Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (née Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[8] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[9] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[10] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.[11] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[12] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[13] Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.[14] In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.[15] Neighbors later described him as \\"full of fun and inclined to play pranks\\",[16] and fond of outdoor sports.[17] In 1850, Cleveland's father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, accepting a job there as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.[18] Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.[19] In 1853, missionary work began to take a toll on Richard's health. He took a new work assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica), and moved his family once again.[20] Shortly after, Richard Cleveland died from a gastric ulcer. Grover was said to have learned about his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.[20]","output":"Commitment to the principles of classical liberalism Honesty Integrity Self-reliance"},{"instruction":"Write a sad haiku about the loss of a friend.

Keep it opaque and write as if you're setting the stage for a book. Introduce the protagonist's name in the last line.","output":"Wintersvain was a village that you wouldn't find if you weren't looking for it, and it was supposed to be that way. The people were cold, just like the weather. With the weight of the village's secrets, it was easier to be quiet and bear your burdens alone. Visitors were few and seldom; they rarely returned. Inevitably, some vacationers who had decided to forgo the traditional luxuries of hotels and vacation planners in favor of saving a few pennies would drive through the narrow pass into Wintersvain. The car would lurch and sputter, inevitably giving out just in front of the only inn available. It was the home of Mr. Crink, who had opened it up to visitors to supplement his income as a butcher. If the idea of raw meat and clean linens sits uncomfortably with you, then you might well understand why some visitors would risk the 3-hour drive to get to the nearest vestige of civilization rather than staying there. Still, the village had charm, if only in the quaint, ghost town kind of way. It might have been more comforting if the village were completely abandoned; that way, visitors wouldn't have to reckon with the unsettling fact that people chose to live there. Houses were sprawled unevenly along the snow banks, an apparent indicator that there had been no housing planner. The people weren't happy about living in Wintersvain, but they underwent what they must. The world could not handle its secrets—at least, not if the status quo was to be maintained; however, all of that would change when Ms. Gracy Corwell, a small-town journalist, pulled into the inn on a cold January night."},{"instruction":"Can you write a 15-word short story about a Hello Kitty figurine coming to life?","output":"White, pink, and plastic, the Hello Kitty figurine so still began to move and wave."},{"instruction":"What shall I cook tonight for dinner?","output":"I am just a bot so I don't know.

Staff economists had previously predicted weakened growth, but the severity of the crisis has heightened concerns. This marks the first recession forecast during the current cycle. The Federal Reserve responded with a smaller interest rate increase to address the crisis and mitigate the fallout. The banking stress, slowing inflation, and a cooling labor market suggest an end to rate hikes. Lawmakers are calling for investigations and additional regulations to prevent future crises. The implications are far-reaching as the US economy teeters on the edge of a recession. A potential downturn could have significant consequences, affecting businesses, job markets, and consumer spending. It also poses a critical challenge for policymakers who must strike a delicate balance between curbing inflation, ensuring financial stability, and implementing measures to mitigate the impact of the banking crisis.

Scan the text below to find out... A bilirubin blood test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance made during your body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. Bilirubin is found in bile, a fluid your liver makes that helps you digest food. If your liver is healthy, it will remove most of the bilirubin from your body. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice, along with a bilirubin blood test, can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease. Other names: Total serum bilirubin, TSB A bilirubin blood test is used to check the health of your liver. The test is also commonly used to help diagnose newborn jaundice. Many healthy babies get jaundice because their livers aren't developed enough to get rid of enough bilirubin. Newborn jaundice is usually not harmful and clears up within a few weeks. But in some cases, high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage, so infants are often tested as a precaution. Your provider may order a bilirubin blood test: If you have symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, or stomach pain. These could be symptoms of hepatitis, cirrhosis, or other liver diseases. They may also be signs of gallbladder disease. To find out if there is a blockage in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from your liver. To check on an existing liver disease or disorder. To diagnose disorders related to problems with breaking down red blood cells. High bilirubin levels in the bloodstream may be a sign of a condition called hemolytic anemia. In this condition, the body destroys red blood cells faster than it makes them. A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Your health care provider may tell you to fast (not eat or drink) for four hours before your blood test. If there are any other special instructions, your provider will let you know. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Normal results can vary, but high bilirubin levels may mean your liver isn't working right. However, abnormal results don't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Other things may cause higher than normal bilirubin levels, such as certain medicines and foods or strenuous exercise. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.","output":"Having too much bilirubin in the bloodstream can lead to jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and eyes to turn yellow."},{"instruction":"Can you help me with something, please?

It should be aimed at beginners and include why using an acrylic wash is a good idea.","output":"I know many of my readers are interested in model-building, which is awesome! Whether you're scratch building, 3D printing, or kitbashing, you'll almost always need to paint your model. But how do you get your textures to really pop? After all, you've spent time creating them; you want to show them off, right? Acrylic washes are one great way to enhance your textures and provide a contrast that shows your model in the best light. Using a wash also ties together the colors and surfaces of your model. So what is an acrylic wash? It's simply watered-down acrylic paint. Here are some tips: 1. In most cases, your wash should be a dark color, like black, brown, or blue. The point is to enhance the darker areas of your work. 2. You'll want to dilute your paint down quite a bit with water to the point that it flows freely. You're basically just making colored water, only slightly thicker. 3. You can vary how thick your wash is depending on the look you're going for. 4. Brush the wash liberally over your entire model. You may want to avoid or mask off any clear or translucent areas. 5. With a paper towel, wipe most of the wash off. Leave it to dry on its own if you want a super grungy look. That's it! You can do the wash after you've painted the model with other colors to tie the look together. You can even do a wash more than once! The light areas of your model can be brought out with a bit of dry brushing, which I'll cover next time! Thanks for reading and have fun crafting!"},{"instruction":"What are the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to left-handedness, and how does the percentage of left-handed individuals differ globally?","output":"Left-handedness is a complex trait that appears to be influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Research suggests that handedness is not determined by a single gene but rather by a complex interaction of genetic factors. For instance, a study published in the journal \\"Brain\\" in 2019 identified four genetic regions that may influence left-handedness, one of which is involved in brain symmetry. On the environmental side, prenatal factors such as exposure to hormones in the womb might affect handedness. There's also some evidence suggesting that birth stress could potentially influence a shift to left-handedness. The percentage of left-handed individuals varies somewhat across different cultures and societies but is generally estimated to be around 10%. There's ongoing research investigating whether cultural attitudes towards left-handedness might influence the prevalence rates reported in different societies."},{"instruction":"Suggest some creative ways (less than ten options) to promote my business without using Facebook.","output":"1. The first and perhaps most obvious choice would be to utilize other social media platforms to their full potential—it’s no longer just Facebook! Businesses can use Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram to promote products and services. Keep in mind that every platform has its own algorithm, so post strategically! 2. In today’s world, it’s a huge disadvantage not to have your own business website. You may not have to rely on social media with a website! Using a blog, you can optimize keywords in order to rank high in search engine results. This can make you highly visible to prospective customers. 3. Don’t underestimate the power of PR! Getting featured in the news, magazines, and other online articles can definitely skyrocket your business success without Facebook. 4. Podcasts can greatly promote your business, and it’s easier than many realize. Since you’ll be on major platforms, it’s a possibility your podcast will be recommended to thousands of people. 5. Traveling and public speaking bring your business back to a classic marketing tactic that will never go extinct: word of mouth. Once others have attended your event, they can go on to tell others all around the world. 6. If you can grow an email list, you might find that you don’t need to use Facebook to market your business. 7. Paying for ads is always an option to grow your brand without Facebook. You can customize nearly every aspect of your ad, even where it shows up for others! While it may not be in every budget, it’s a viable option."},{"instruction":"Compose a haiku on the joyful experience of consuming Reese's peanut butter cups.

This is the state that warned librarians to “err on the side of caution” when choosing books, or risk being charged with a third-degree felony for exposing kids to materials that run afoul of vague laws on what’s appropriate. It’s also the state where inappropriate or sexual material is more times than not flagged in books by LGBTQ and Black authors, held up by conservative activists as examples of perversion in our schools. Florida is the state that bans teachers from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity in all grades and limits how they can talk about race. It’s got a Legislature that made it more onerous for districts to approve and review books. Where schools preemptively asked teachers to remove books from their classrooms until they conducted that review process. Let’s keep in mind that this year the Florida Legislature passed a bill that allows any person in a county to challenge a book and force a district to pull it out of circulation until it goes through a review. If a parent disagrees with a district’s ruling on that challenge, they can appeal to the governor-appointed commissioner of education, who will most likely be all ears. No wonder a parent convinced a North Florida district to remove a novel about school segregation called “Little Rock Nine” — based on real events in U.S. history — from elementary schools even though it is at a third-grade reading level. Who needs book burnings when fear creates its own chilling effect? Who needs government censors when you have groups like Moms for Liberty skimming books to look for any hint of sexual content, no matter its literary value and appropriateness for upper grades, content that makes white people uncomfortable or so-called leftist indoctrination?","output":"Florida has recently passed multiple bills dealing with what books can be kept in schools. Teachers can be charged with a felony if they are deemed to have exposed kids to books the state says are inappropriate. Books by Black and LGBTQ writers are more often targeted as being inappropriate. Schools asked teachers to remove all books from their classrooms until they could be approved. Even books that have been previously approved can be challenged by anyone in a county and will be removed until they have been reviewed. Then the decision can be appealed to a commissioner appointed by the governor if they disagree with the ruling."},{"instruction":"Make this into a poem.

Order the novels by release date and make each summary 2-3 sentences and don't give too many major plot details away.","output":"Nicholas Sparks, a well-known American author, has written many books over the years that capture people's hearts and attention. In fact, many of his novels have become so popular that they were used as the baseline for a major motion picture. Here are three of his most notable books. 1. The Notebook - 1996 Having just returned from serving in World War II, Noah begins the massive task of refurbishing a large plantation on the coast of North Carolina. As he works, he recalls a summer romance that he had over a decade before with a girl named Allie. Determined to see if a summer romance could be true love, Allie makes a trip back to North Carolina where she must make some hard decisions about love and life. 2. Message in a Bottle - 1998 Theresa, a divorced woman who is on vacation finds a mysterious bottle by the sea with a love note inside. The message is written by an unknown man to his lost lover. Despite her apprehensions about love since she was betrayed by her ex-husband, the journalist within Theresa is intrigued and the bottled message leads her on a hunt to locate the owner. 3. A Walk to Remember - 1999 Set in 1958, the story follows a boy named Landon and a girl named Jamie as they navigate high school, life, and love. Jamie is devout to her religion, reserved in her dress and personality, and spends most of her time caring for her father or volunteering her time to help local orphans or animals.

He stated that until the box was opened, the cat was (in a sense) both \\"dead and alive\\". This thought experiment is used to explain how scientific theory works, meaning that no one knows definitively if any scientific theory is right or wrong until said theory can be tested and proved."},{"instruction":"Explain this same concept, but so that a 3rd grader could understand it. The rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics. It helps the car go faster by creating downforce, which is a force that pushes the car down onto the track. This helps the car grip the track better and go around corners faster. The rear wing is located at the back of the car, and it looks like a big flat airplane wing. It's made up of two parts: the main plane and the flap. The main plane is the big, flat part, and the flap is the smaller, adjustable part that can move up or down. When the car is going in a straight line, the flap is usually set at a very small angle to the main plane. This creates a small amount of downforce, which helps the car grip the track better. But when the car is going around a corner, the flap can be adjusted to a steeper angle. This creates more downforce, which helps the car go around the corner faster without sliding off the track. So, the rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics, helping it go faster and grip the track better by creating downforce. Therefore basically, an F1 car is designed to be really fast by using the power of the wind, and the shape of the car and its wings help it stay on the ground and go even faster. It's like a really cool superhero car that uses wind powers to win races!","output":"An F1 Car has a special wing at the back that helps it go fast and stay on track.

The rear wing is important because it helps the car go faster while staying on track by pushing it down.

Try to keep the summary to 5 sentences or fewer. It’s been 15 years since the release of Toy Story. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of Andy’s toys have become indelible parts of our movie-going culture, much like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and Snow White. Ever since that big hit in 1995, Pixar has put out one quality film after another, including most recent masterpieces WALL-E and Up. But while those two films introduced new worlds and characters, the creators of Toy Story 3 faced the immense challenge of not only living up to the quality of the previous two installments in the series, but not desecrating those beloved characters by delivering a limp third part to the trilogy. I am happy to report that Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar’s best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy. Returning to the familiar themes, mainly the feelings of insecurity and obsolesce that come with the passage of time, Toy Story 3 picks up years after the second part. Andy is now ready to head off to college and Woody and friends are déclassé, relegated to a toy chest. But when a horrible mistake almost sends the gang off to the garbage dump, Buzz Lightyear makes a decision that re-routes the toys to a daycare center with the hope that someone will play with them. Unfortunately, a mafia of toys already rules this daycare and a plush teddy bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) and a Ken doll (Michael Keaton) conspire to banish Andy’s toys to the infant classroom, a fate worse than death. Naturally, it is up to Woody to save them. Even though Toy Story 3 hews to a similar format of the previous installment, that doesn’t mean it lacks thrills, laughs, excitement and peril. Essentially a prison break film, Toy Story 3 also makes knowing references to film noir, Westerns and numerous other filmic tropes. Pixar has always made movies that can be appreciated on many levels, and this one is no exception.","output":"Here is the summary you asked for. Toy Story 3 faced the difficult challenge of maintaining the quality featured in the first two films, but it succeeds in that challenge. Toy Story 3 is one of Pixar's best films and one of the best installments in the Toy Story series. The film takes place with Andy heading to college, where his classic childhood toys are mistakenly sent to a garbage dump before Buzz reroutes them to a local daycare. They find out that the daycare is run by what amounts to a toy mafia headed by Lotso, a toy bear. The toys must find a way to survive being sent to the infant room and escape their way from the daycare. This movie takes its inspiration from many genres of film including film noir, westerns and more."},{"instruction":"Imagine you are Anne Frank and write a new diary entry from her perspective.

Burt and I had been married for 42 years and had 6 children and 14 grandchildren. It was very surprising to others that he didn’t say the three words that meant so much to people worldwide. The words were not important to me, though. I continued with my speech, “This is not to say he did not love me.

MH: And now we're seeing a similar picture for clean electricity? SS: Yes, we very much see the same thing happening in the power sector. And, in fact, there's not just one but a series of tipping points. I would say that the first one was when new solar and wind power became cheaper than new coal and gas power – and that's already in the rear-view mirror. That's the case in the vast majority of countries in the world. A second one that we're already beginning to pass now is new solar and wind generation becoming cheaper than existing fossil fuel generation. So, in other words, it's cheaper to build a solar or a wind plant than it is to keep shovelling coal into a coal power station or piping gas into a gas power station. A third tipping point, which we're coming up towards, is when renewables plus energy storage become cheaper than coal and gas power. There's a piece of analysis from researchers at Exeter University which predicts that by the end of this decade, solar power plus storage will be half the cost of coal in big markets, in the EU, China, India, Japan, the US.

Please review this information and provide a summary of why earthquakes happen and what happens during an earthquake. An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth, or tectonic plates, suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!","output":"An earthquake is the result of two tectonic plates colliding as they move past each other.

Here are some ways in which the Fourth Amendment governs how police conduct investigations while protecting individual rights: 1. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects all citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons and their property, unless by a search and seizure warrant, and only if the warrant details the probable cause of the search or seizure, the person or things to be seized, and the locations where these things will be found. 2. Probable cause is the legal standard that police officers must adhere to when seizing (arresting) a person or searching a person, place, or thing. Probable cause is defined as that which would cause a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed and that the person being seized is the one who committed the crime, or that the place or thing being searched contain fruits of the crime (i.e. evidence). 3. When an officer has probable cause to seize a person, place, or thing or search said person, place, or thing, they will draft a search warrant that will be reviewed by a judge and filed with the court of jurisdiction where the crime took place. 4. Sometimes exceptions to the search warrant rule will still warrant a seizure or search if the exception has been previously recognized by the courts through a previous ruling, and when requiring a search or seizure warrant would have put an excessive burden on the police to prevent the death or injury of another person, property damage, or the destruction of evidence. Examples of this include the exigent circumstance exception (police not searching or seizing immediately would result in someone getting killed or hurt, such as arresting a person without a warrant as they are in the process of attempting to kill someone), or plain view exception (a police officer sees a person attempting to flush drugs down a toilet in their residence, so a search warrant may not be needed to enter the home and retrieve the drugs before they are destroyed.) These are just some examples of how the intricacies of the Fourth Amendment play a significant role in how police officers conduct business."},{"instruction":"What is wrong with this code?

Rollmops are a bit of a delicacy and are not enjoyed in many places around the world. If you try to break down the word for yourself, may conjure up an image of a special type of cleaning instrument in your head. However, this is far from what a rollmop is. In this article, we will talk about what rollmops are and where they originated from. What Are Rollmops? A rollmop is a unique food that consists of pickled herring fillets that have been rolled into a cylindrical shape, stuffed with fillings, and fastened together with skewers before being stored in brine. Rollmop fillings typically include vegetables such as onion, pickled cucumber, and pitted green olives stuffed with pimento peppers. The brine that rollmops are stored in traditionally contains water, vinegar, and salt, but can also contain a variety of other additives. These optional extras include sugar or other sweeteners, raw onion slices, peppercorns, and mustard seeds. Where Did Rollmops Originate From? The name ‘rollmop’ is German in origin, making it friendly for many English speakers. This food has been a staple in countries in Northern Europe since the medieval period. It also had a spark in popularity in Germany in the early 19th century and is currently served as part of a traditional German hangover breakfast. Currently, rollmops are eaten in parts of Europe, South America, the United States, and Canada. Rollmops are also unbelievably popular in present-day Czechia and Slovakia. Conclusion Rollmops are not a food that will be suited to everyone’s tastes. Especially for those who do not enjoy seafood, vinegar, or pickled vegetables, this dish may seem very offputting. However, if you’ve never tried pickled herring, we encourage you to give rollmops a try! Although it may be a little bit of an adventurous choice, those who like to try new foods and experience new cultures can find everything they need and more in a simple rollmop."},{"instruction":"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers. A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs. This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was \\"still acting weird\\" the next day. After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter. In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: \\"[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog. \\"I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.\\" Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they \\"weren't out of the woods yet\\", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. The experts explained: \\"Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them. \\"Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.\\"","output":"What is the issue? Dog owners must be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, particularly ones containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be lethal for dogs. What happened to the dog?

It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning home early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state. Did she take the dog to the vet? She took the dog to the emergency vet. What did the vet diagnose? It was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. What happened to the dog? There is a happy ending to the story because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage. What treatment did it receive? The vet gave the dog fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Are cats at risk from tea tree oil? Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Why is tea tree oil dangerous to cats? Cats don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. Why is tea tree oil dangerous for dogs? Dogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. What are the symptoms of poisoning?

It comprises the blood vessels, lungs, and airways. The respiratory system also includes the muscles that move your lungs. Together these components circulate oxygen throughout the body and remove waste gases like carbon dioxide. The respiratory system serves a variety of purposes. In addition to assisting with breathing, it also: • It enables you to speak and smell. •It also warms the temperature of the air to that of your body and moisturizes it to the humidity levels a body needs. •Provides the body cells with oxygen •Enables a body to exhale waste gases from the body •Keeps irritants and harmful substances out of the airways. The main muscle used for breathing is the diaphragm, which is situated below the lungs. It is a sizable, dome-shaped muscle that frequently contracts continually and rhythmically. The diaphragm's role in breathing is it contracts and tightens during inhalation and the chest cavity widens. This creates a vacuum through the contractions, drawing air into the lungs. The diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome-like shape during exhalation, forcing air out of the lungs."},{"instruction":"Write a short story about an extremely lucky girl.

A man started to creep up behind her so that he might take the diamond and run off with it. As he got closer, a fish flopped out of the water and landed in between Lucy and the man.

Make it a bulleted list. Diana, Princess of Wales, formerly Lady Diana Frances Spencer, was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the youngest daughter of the then Viscount and Viscountess Althorp, now the late (8th) Earl Spencer and the late Hon. Mrs Shand-Kydd, daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy. Until her father inherited the Earldom, she was styled The Honourable Diana Spencer. Viscount Althorp was Equerry to George VI from 1950 to 1952, and to The Queen from 1952 to 1954. Lady Diana's parents, who had married in 1954, separated in 1967 and the marriage was dissolved in 1969. Earl Spencer later married Raine, Countess of Dartmouth in 1976. Together with her two elder sisters Sarah (born 1955), Jane (born 1957) and her brother Charles (born 1964), Diana continued to live with her father at Park House, Sandringham, until the death of her grandfather, the 7th Earl Spencer. In 1975, the family moved to the Spencer seat at Althorp (a stately house dating from 1508) in Northamptonshire, in the English Midlands. Lady Diana was educated first at a preparatory school, Riddlesworth Hall at Diss, Norfolk, and then in 1974 went as a boarder to West Heath, near Sevenoaks, Kent.

I get mixed up. I forget who I’m supposed to stand behind—all the bald heads look alike—and I get my first reprimand of the day. The clock reads 4:35. We jog out of our barracks into the chilled morning air and join the other platoons on the parade grounds for PT and a run. I don’t want the guys to see me with my head shaved, even though I don’t know them, even though everyone else’s head is shaved, including all of theirs. Spotlights shine down on us from above—a whole yard full of bald-headed kids doing push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, and lunges. “For those of you who have just arrived, I’ll explain,” the warden says through a megaphone. “You are standing in front of the Supermax Unit of the prison. Some of you will end up in this building because you are unwilling to change your lives. In this building, you will be confined to your cell twenty-three hours a day. I guarantee that when you are sitting there, listening to me make this little speech every morning, you will wish you had taken advantage of the opportunity you have here today.” Then he starts reciting something and everyone joins in. It’s some kind of motto. Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion, or it will be killed. Every morning, a lion wakes up also. It knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn’t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you had better be running. Then, we run. I was on the track-and-field team in junior high, but by high school I had Kicker and other things to think about. The run is slow, but I still lag behind, and no amount of screaming by the guards will make me move faster. My headache is gone, but my mood isn’t good, and I step it up just to avoid punching someone. Lunch is more swill on a shingle. Then it is time for Stripes. “These are the Stripes of Shame,” the platoon captain says, holding up a smock with bold black and white stripes across it and a big letter P on the back. “These are the only garments made especially for this prison. Some of you will make them during your work duty. You wear these while performing community service. They show the taxpayers of this state that their money is being well spent. Today, this platoon will be picking up trash in a city park. You will be chained. You will be guarded. And you will be silent. Any attempt to engage in conversation with a non-prisoner will be interpreted as an attempt to escape. And you do not want that.” I put on my smock. We are loaded into trucks, and I’m shackled to the girl next to me. I notice that her hair is fuzzy with stubble and I wonder how long it will take for mine to grow that much. “I used to work in a video store,” she says. “I saw everything.” “I saw some army movies on TV too,” I whisper back. “Everything old is new again. I’m Julie Martin. I sleep under you but you probably didn’t notice. Cocaine possession. I was holding it for my stupid boyfriend.” “Krysta Walters,” I introduce myself. “Busted selling ecstasy to an undercover. For my boyfriend.” “Two smart operators,” says Julie. “Most girls are in here because of their crappy taste in guys.”","output":"In the fiery depths of Hell, where agony and torment were the order of the day, the morning alarm shattered the unholy silence. The blinding glow of infernal lights illuminated the cursed domain, casting sinister shadows that danced along the walls. Demonic guards, with their razor-sharp horns and sulfurous breath, slammed their truncheons against the metal bunks, jolting the imprisoned souls from their fitful slumber. The air echoed with their spine-chilling screams as they bellowed orders. Amidst the clamor, the souls rose from their charred resting places, their eyes filled with a haunting despair. With trepidation, they lined up in their cubicles, their gazes fixed straight ahead, awaiting the morning count. The guards, grotesque demons with smoldering eyes, conducted the ritualistic inspection, ensuring the presence of every damned soul. Time seemed to crawl as the wretched captives shuffled through the dimly lit corridors, hurrying to the fetid latrines. In the absence of mirrors, they spared themselves the torment of seeing their wretched visages, their heads shaven clean, a stark symbol of their damned existence. Clad in threadbare garments, the souls marched outside, braving the oppressive heat that enveloped the infernal realm. They converged with other platoons on the scorched parade grounds, a desolate expanse where their infernal punishments took shape. The platoon captain, a towering demon with bat-like wings, addressed the tormented gathering, his voice dripping with malice. \\"Welcome to the training grounds of eternal suffering,\\" the platoon captain snarled, his voice resonating through the sulfurous air. \\"Here, you will endure physical torment that matches the depths of your sins. You will run, you will sweat, and you will learn the true meaning of despair.\\" As the platoon captain continued his diabolic sermon, the souls stood motionless, their minds clouded with a mix of fear and resignation. The captain recited a haunting mantra, a twisted creed of survival within the infernal abyss. \\"In the fiery depths of Hell, there is no rest for the weak,\\" the captain proclaimed, his voice echoing with sadistic delight. \\"Every soul must strive to outpace their fellow tormentor or risk descending further into the abyss. Whether you be demon or damned, heed my words—when the flames rise, you must run.\\" And so, they ran. The main character, their spirit weary and broken, dragged themselves along, their every step burdened with the weight of their sins. The demonic guards, their monstrous forms towering over the tortured souls, barked commands and lashed out with fiery whips, their taunts and jeers fueling the captives' desperate resolve. The main character, their head throbbing with infernal pain, pushed forward, an embodiment of defiance amid the relentless torment. The midday respite brought no reprieve from their anguish. Instead, they were subjected to another vile meal—nauseating concoctions served on tarnished platters. The platoon captain, a demon of sadistic delight, introduced the \\"Stripes of Shame\\" with malevolent glee. The striped garments, adorned with hellish symbols of punishment, served as a constant reminder of their fallen status. The platoon captain's words dripped with venom as they explained the purpose of these garments—to humiliate, degrade, and remind the condemned souls of their eternal damnation. Chained and silenced, the souls were led like a procession of broken spirits, their striped smocks billowing in the sulfurous wind. They were herded into the accursed wagons, their limbs shackled to one another, their every movement restricted. It was during this treacherous journey, bound by the chains of their collective misery, that the main character encountered Julie Martin, a soul ensnared by her association with a wretched lover. They found solace in their shared predicament, a glimmer of camaraderie amidst the labyrinth of damned souls. Julie remarked bitterly, \\"Most girls in here have their lives tarnished by their wretched taste in companions.\\""},{"instruction":"What is the concept of quantum computing, and how does it differ from classical computing?","output":"Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations using quantum bits, or qubits.

Bumblebees are known as social bees and live in colonies. Their nests have a yearly cycle and can contain 50 to 500 occupants. They don’t look like your typical beehive as the nest entrance of the colony can usually be found in the ground. Bumblebees work their entire lives feeding and protecting the colony, particularly the queen bee. If a bumblebee feels as if the safety of the colony is threatened or the bee is provoked, it will sting. Carpenter bees are solitary insects and are often described as harmless (to humans, but not your wooden deck!). Female carpenter bees create their nest in wood, using their strong jaws to chew through porches, doors, and other wooden materials. They prefer soft, weathered and unpainted wood. While female carpenter bees do have stingers, they rarely use them. This only occurs if the bee is seriously provoked. Male carpenter bees are very protective but do not possess a stinger. They may, however, fly towards someone who has gotten too close to the nest in an attempt to appear intimidating.","output":"Female carpenter bees have stingers, but male carpenter bees do not."},{"instruction":"Forest - create an acrostic poem about it.","output":"Foliage in the trees above, One of nature’s beauties is the woodlands, Ranging from trees big and small - an abundance of them all, East to west and north to south, Starting from the roots to the top, Trees as tall as buildings - oh, how small we are."},{"instruction":"Can you rewrite this passage so that it is more descriptive and imaginative?

It was her haven, where she would indulge in hours of exploration, delicately handling the exquisite relics that adorned the space. Her favorite thing over there was the old wooden chest nestled in a dark corner of the room. The chest would beckon to her, even when she was far away, drawing her closer with an irresistible magnetic force. One rainy day, Penny finally resolved to unveil the chest's mysteries. She lifts the lid of the chest, and suddenly, she can’t believe what her eyes can see. It’s filled with shining gold. The mixed feelings of surprise and happiness that she felt were short-lived – she heard a deep and gruff voice emerge from within the wooden chest. ‘What do you think you're doing?’ The chest growled. Penny was jolted so intensely that she almost slammed the lid shut. Yet, her inquisitive nature egged her on, compelling her to stay put and listen. The voice persisted. ‘You have no right to open this chest. It belongs to another.’ Penny's confusion mounted. How could the chest belong to anyone else? She tried to question the voice about the rightful owner but held back. Instead, she listened, captivated by the voice that began to weave a tale. The voice belonged to a pirate who had sailed the seas eons ago. The pirate stashed his treasure in the attic. He collected everything he had ever made and saved in his life inside this chest. Nobody in the world could know the location of his hidden and gold-filled chest except him, not even his crewmates. The voice cautioned her that the riches were cursed, but Penny was skeptical. She put her hands inside it and filled them with gold. Her eyes followed her hands until she pulls them up to see the gold shine in the light. For weeks, the chest continued to talk to Penny. It spun stories of amusement and intrigue, and the two grew intimately close. Whenever Penny felt low or lonely, she would clamber up to the attic, nestle by the chest, and listen to its tales. Slowly, Penny began to realize that the chest was more than a voice.

The Gummy Yum Bears lived in the meadows and foothills that led up to Gummy Yum Mountain. They loved and appreciated their home. There were orchards that grew yummy gummy fruit along the edges of the meadow where the bears' village could be found. They lived off of yummy gummy fruit and Swedish fish that they caught from the stream that flowed down the mountain. The bears never used more than needed and were always grateful to Mother Gummy Nature. When they first came to the Land of Gummy Yum, they did so with another gummy kind that they had cohabitated in their previous home of Candy Land. These gummies were known as the Gumble Wumble Worms. No one is quite sure of what exactly divided the gummy communities after they reached Gummy Yum, but divided they definitely became. The bears were taught at a young age to never venture towards the coastal jungles of Gummy Yum, where the Gumble Wumbles dwelled. Little ones of the bear community were always teasing each other with scary stories from gummy lore that told of savage gummy worms that feasted on little bears. Lemon Limey Bear and Cheery Cherry Bear were two little bears that were B.G.F.F.s or Best Gummy Friends For Life. They were both very curious bears. Since the moment they heard the stories of the savage worms, both little brave-spirited gummies had been ready to investigate for themselves. One evening, Limey arrived at Cheery Cherry's house for a planned slumber party. Cheery's parents had gone to Gummy Resort and Casino for the weekend and her older sister was put in charge of watching the younger gummies. To her dismay, Cheery's older sister eventually found that the best friends were nowhere in the house. They were headed on an exploration of the coastal jungle gummy regions. When the little gummy friends arrived at the outskirts of the jungle, they didn't even hesitate. Both of them plunged into the jungle, full steam ahead. They were so excited and exhilarated as they ran through the jungle brush, they hardly even felt it when they were eaten by an Anaconda-sized Gumble Wumble Gummy Worm that ended their sweet little gummy lives that day."},{"instruction":"Create a conversation between Yoda and his gardener.

WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMIZING YOUR HOUSE TO FIT YOUR LIFESTYLE, CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS OF REMODELING THE HOUSE: By changing the layout of a room with house renovations, you can customize how you utilize space. Using light fixtures in the perfect spot will change any ambiance or mood you want for that particular part of your home. A porch swing might be just what your back porch needs if it is currently not something offered within its design. A fireplace in your living room will add a focal point and cozy feel to any space and add benefits for warmth during colder winter nights. Building an addition will provide benefits for extra square footage and make use of underused space. Add a lazy susan to that awkward corner cabinet for easier access to all of your dishes without moving them around. Get rid of the off-brand appliances and update with some stainless steel as well as built-in microwaves! Large trees provide shade and privacy in your outdoor space.","output":"Hey! I've got some tips to share for anyone looking to change up things around the house and make it more lively. First: you don't need to focus on big changes! There are lots of things you can do that can make a big impact with a small investment. Here are a few: New light fixtures (even standing or tabletop ones) can easily change the mood of a room, especially with the options at your disposal. Consider dimmable lights, RGB lights, or candelabra fixtures for example. A porch swing or other outdoor furniture can inspire you to spend more of your time outside, making a cozier environment to be in. Both of these are just scratching the surface of some of the relatively low-cost and low-effort improvements you can make at home. Something as simple as changing the layout of a room can make a big difference, too. It can change the way you manage your routine, or your workflow if you work from home in a bedroom office, for instance. As we go on, I'll talk about things that require more funds or work to do, but they're quite fulfilling to get done, and make for a much better home both for yourself (and any family that lives with you or may inherit it) or if you ever decide to sell. Something you may not often think of is cabinet accessibility in your kitchen. Surprisingly, it can make a big impact with something so seemingly insignificant, like putting a lazy susan mechanism in your corner cabinets. It makes it a lot easier to get things out since you don't have to strain yourself reaching to the back and over other things stored in them. Other kitchen improvements include updating your appliances. I know it isn't the most compelling option, but it can make a huge difference to have something more modern with better ease of use, and it looks prettier, too! Some people prefer to settle for what's usable though, and that's okay; just remember to pick what most suits your needs. If you've got a lot of unused space in your lot, there are plenty of things you can do with it. One that can have a surprising impact on the overall quality of the home is tastefully populating your yard with plants such as trees and bushes. The trees can provide shade, privacy, and places for things like swings or feeders for local birds, and bushes can be super pretty ways of accentuating spaces in your yard. One that's more complicated, but can massively increase the value of your property is adding an addition to your house. It's a great way of adding new functions and square footage, as you can have one or more extra rooms to dedicate to activities or living. Even though it requires a lot of time and work, it's very rewarding with the increase in value and use of your home: I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers, but it's a great longer-term project for experienced home improvers! Thanks for reading along. I hope these suggestions have given you ideas about how you can tailor your home to fit your needs, especially if these led you to your own creative ideas! I look forward to seeing home improvement being more commonplace, especially since it's such a fulfilling thing to do.

Unlike any other vertebrates, a turtle's shell is a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column that has grown outward to fuse with the overlying skin and scales, called scutes. This unique structure provides turtles with a sturdy and resilient shield against predators, offering protection to their softer body parts. The shell's upper section, called the carapace, is domed and can deflect direct attacks, while the lower section, or plastron, safeguards the turtle's belly. Some species, such as box turtles, even have a hinge on their plastron, allowing them to completely close their shell for maximum protection. The shell also aids in camouflage and, in aquatic species, can assist in streamlining for swimming. While often perceived as a passive form of defense, a turtle's shell is a dynamic tool crucial to their survival across diverse environments."},{"instruction":"Write a post of less than 175 words about how outsourcing is a good investment in a small business.

Adalina was no ordinary fairy. No one knew why, but she had no wings. And, what’s more, she was a Princess, daughter of the Great Fairy Queen. As she was so tiny, like a flower, life was just a series of problems for her. Not only couldn’t she fly, but she hardly had any magical powers, since fairy magic comes from their delicate crystal wings. So, from an early age, Adalina had depended on the help of others for many things. She grew up thanking people, smiling and being friendly, so naturally all the creatures in the forest were delighted to help her. But when she reached the age to become Queen, many fairies doubted she could be a good Queen with such a disability. They argued and protested so much that Adalina had to agree to take a test in which she would have to demonstrate to everyone the wonders she could work. The little fairy became extremely sad. What could she do? She was hardly magic at all, and couldn't even travel far with those little legs of hers. But while Adalina sat on a stone next to the river, trying to think of something that would surprise the other fairies, the news of the test was spreading among the friendly forest animals. Before long, hundreds of creatures were by her side, ready to help her however she needed. -“Thank you so much, little friends. I feel much better with you by my side,” she said with the sweetest of smiles, -\\"but I don't know whether you'll be able to help me.\\" -“Of course we will!” answered the squirrel, -“Tell us, what will you do to surprise those foolish fairies?” -“Wow…. if only I could, I would love to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the Earth, and keep it in a dewdrop, so that when it was needed it could be used as a lantern for all who live in the forest. Or… I’d also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that the nocturnal creatures could see its beauty… But I don’t have any magic or any wings to keep it in…” -“Well, you must have your magic kept somewhere else then! Look!\\" an old tortoise shouted excitedly, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it. It was true. When Adalina had been telling her friends of her deepest wishes, a wave of magic had washed over them, and there they all were, flying through the air, making a magic rainbow, and capturing not just one but hundreds of rays of sunshine within fine drops of water that filled the sky with tiny brilliant lamps. For the whole day and night you could see squirrels, mice, frogs, birds and fish leaping through the sky, filling it with light and colour, in a spectacle never seen before and that filled the forest dwellers with delight. Adalina was declared Queen of the Fairies, despite her not knowing from where such a powerful magic had come. And it wasn’t until some time later that the young Queen understood that she was the first of the Great Fairies, whose magic is to be found not in one's wings but within all one’s true friends.","output":"Adalina was disparate. She was the only fairy who didn't have wings, and no one knew why. Furthermore, Adalina was the daughter of the Great Fairy Queen, making her a princess. Adalina was as petite as a flower. However, life didn't treat her delicately. Throughout her life, she constantly faced problems. She couldn't fly and she had barely any magical powers. This is because fairy power comes from the wings. Therefore, Adalina had to depend on others for help. She was extremely grateful for the help she would receive. She made sure that she always smiled and thanked people. Adalina was loved by the forest creatures due to her affectionate nature. When the time came for her to be Queen, many people doubted her abilities since they did not deem her as powerful. The people protested and argued against it, and Adalina felt as though she had to take a test in an attempt to exhibit the miracles she could spawn. This worried the fairy because she knew she did not have the powers expected of her. She can not even travel far distances with her small legs. Adaline sat on a stone near the river and attempted to think of a solution that would leave the fairies astonished. Eventually, the amiable forest animal heard the news of the test that Adalina would have to take. Shortly after, hundreds of the creatures came by her side, prepared to help for as long as necessary. \\"Thank you, friends. I feel better now that you all are with me.\\" she said with a beloved smile, \\"but I'm not sure whether you'll be able to help me.\\" \\"Of course, we will!\\" the squirrel answered, \\"What is your plan for surprising the imprudent fairies?\\" \\"Well, if only there was a way. I would love to be able to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the Earth and keep it in a dewdrop so that it could be used as a lantern whenever needed for everyone who lives in the forest. I would also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that nocturnal creatures could see its allure. Unfortunately, I don't have the magic required or the wings to keep the dewdrop in.\\" \\"You must have your magic kept elsewhere then! Look!\\" an old tortoise eagerly shouted, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it. The old tortoise was right. Whilst Adalina had been discussing her profound wishes, magic had taken over. They were all flying through the air, producing a magical rainbow and capturing not only one but hundreds of sunshine rays. They were confined within fine water droplets that occupied the sky with miniature gleaming lamps. Throughout the day and night, squirrels, mice, frogs, birds, and fish could be seen leaping across the sky, providing it with color and light. This performance has never been witnessed before, which captivated the forest dwellers. Adalina was appointed Queen of the Fairies, even though she was unaware of where the powerful magic had transpired. It isn't until later that the young Queen realized that she was the first of the Great Fairies whose magic was not found in their wings but within her sincere friends."},{"instruction":"Write a journal entry from a young boy about his first day of high school.","output":"Dear Journal, Today I attended high school for the very first time. I had only seen the school in passing when Dad would drop me off at intermediate school just down the street. I always knew I would be going to this high school since it was close to the intermediate school and most of the kids who went to my school would end up going there too. I was surprised at how big the school was. There was a big square courtyard in the middle of the school called \\"the quad\\" where students would walk on their way to their classes. My classes were very far apart, literally at opposite ends of the school. I am very tired now from all the walking around. But I enjoyed my first day of high school. Everyone seemed a lot older and more mature, and there weren't any nonsense or \\"kid\\" behaviors. Everyone seemed like they were determined to study and work hard, and hardly anyone disrupted the class during lessons. Lunch was great. There were so many different foods, and you could get more than one meal as long as you paid for it. They even had chocolate milk! I really enjoyed today's meal: roast turkey with gravy and stuffing. The cafeteria was crowded but the building was so big that there were still many seats where I could sit down to eat. I met some new people today. I also got to see my old friends from intermediate school. I have several classes with my old friends and I made new friends in the other classes. Overall, I am really enjoying high school. I can't wait to learn how to drive so I can drive myself to school every day."},{"instruction":"Imagine you are a well-known detective from the late 1800s recounting the historical details of the 1972 Munich Olympics attack and the recent initiatives to further investigate it in your journal. Please convert the provided information into a detective's journal entry. A panel of historians set up to review the 1972 attack on the Munich Olympics is starting its three-year mission to examine what happened before, during and after the events of five decades ago on Tuesday, the German government said. In April, Germany's Interior Ministry named the eight-member international commission of experts, most based in Israel or Germany. That was part of an agreement last year with relatives of the 11 Israeli team members who were killed by Palestinian militants. The panel's first meeting was being held at the Interior Ministry on Tuesday. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser pledged that “the events surrounding this terrible attack will finally be examined thoroughly and transparently.” “The research findings should deliver answers to the many unresolved questions — answers which the German government has owed the victims’ family members and the public for more than 50 years,” Faeser said in a statement. Her ministry said there would be “regular publications and events.” In September, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier apologized for multiple German failures before, during and after the attack as he joined his Israeli counterpart and relatives of the slain athletes at a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary. Days earlier, an agreement for the relatives to receive a total of 28 million euros (30 million) in compensation headed off a threatened boycott of the event. The sum included much smaller payments made earlier. Germany also agreed to acknowledge failures by authorities at the time and to set up the expert review. On Sept. 5, 1972, eight members of a Palestinian group called Black September clambered over the Olympic village's unguarded fence. They burst into the building where the Israeli team was staying, killing wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano. Some Israeli athletes managed to escape but nine were seized. The captors demanded the release of more than 200 Palestinians held by Israel and two German left-wing extremists in West German prisons.","output":"Entry: 30th May, 2023 The task at hand is no common one, not a mere question of theft or deceit, but of unearthing long-buried secrets from the tumultuous past. It seems the German government, still haunted by the ghosts of the tragic 1972 Munich Olympics, has entrusted the monumental task of unraveling the events of yesteryears to a group of esteemed historians. In the spring month of April, the German Interior Ministry carefully selected an assembly of eight learned minds, mostly hailing from Israel or the Fatherland, in response to an agreement with kin of the unfortunate Israeli athletes. Lives were lost to the ruthless hands of Palestinian militants, a wound that remains open to this day. Today, under the stoic gaze of the Interior Ministry's stone walls, they held their maiden meeting. Nancy Faeser, a woman of high authority and Minister of Interior, was solemn in her pledge that the dark clouds shrouding the events of the horrendous attack would finally part to let in the light of transparency. \\"The answers which we owe to the victims' family members and the public shall finally be given, answers that have been entombed for more than 50 years,\\" she declared with firm resolve. The Ministry's plan was clear: regular publications and scholarly events to slowly but steadily lift the veil of mystery. As I recollect, the German President, one Frank-Walter Steinmeier, offered his public apologies for the German shortcomings, extending his remorse to the Israeli nation and the relatives of the fallen athletes. This was during a ceremony in September, marking half a century since the dark incident unfolded. In an attempt to ameliorate the situation, the German state proposed a settlement of 28 million euros for the bereaved, a part of which had been disbursed prior. An admission of previous authorities' inadequacies was made, as well as the promise of a deep-dive review. The shadows of that grim day on Sept. 5, 1972, remain in the annals of history. Eight members of the notorious group Black September breached the Olympic village's paltry defenses. The Israeli team's quarters became the setting for a macabre scene, with the wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano losing their lives in the ensuing struggle. As the harsh narrative of the past unfolds, it's clear some Israeli athletes made a successful escape, while others weren't as fortunate. The truth, it seems, is still hidden in the shroud of time, and this new commission seeks to unveil it. The stage is set, and I shall keep my eye on the proceedings."},{"instruction":"President Biden is 80 years o?d this year and the olden president to hold office.

Dozens and dozens of excited children and sleepy parents filled the building. The facility contained three different pools, and all of them were child depth. In some lanes, newborn babies bounced in the arms of their parents, splashing and giggling. In other lanes, slightly older children were learning to take their first paddles all on their own. The little girl in our story was one of those “first paddlers”. She loved jumping and splashing in the pool, and so doing everything on her own. She looked to the side wall where her father was sitting. “Daddy, watch this!” she shouted, before leaping off the steps and propelling towards the platform set up in the water. Daddy smiled. She had come such a long way in these classes and could now really do lots of things on her own. The first half of class involved instruction on things like flipping and back floats, but the second half of class was the little girl’s favorite part. Less instruction, and more splashing! They got to take turns jumping off the deck of the pool, only to turn around, return to the deck, and pull themselves out. She was determined to make the biggest splash she’d every done today. Her leap was so big, and her splash was so giant, it was hard to argue she didn’t succeed. Class ended with a “washing machine” where all the kids hang on the teacher while she spins them around in the water. Everyone giggles and laughs at that one. Leaving the pool, she ran back to her daddy who was waiting with a towel to make her dry and warm. A quick rinse, and change of clothes, and it might be time for the two of them to grab a post class treat. The little girl loved these fun Sunday mornings spent just with her dad."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post listing the 5 best-selling games on PlayStation 1.

The Texas House of Representatives has voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, an unprecedented move following a legislative probe that faulted the third-term Republican for a yearslong pattern of corruption, including abusing his office’s powers, retaliating against whistleblowers and obstructing justice. Under state law, Paxton is now temporarily suspended from his duties as attorney general and will await a Senate trial. The vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.” “The evidence is substantial. It is alarming and unnerving,” said GOP Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, during his closing statement following hours of debate. The committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton. Democrat Rep. Harold Dutton was one of the members voting present. He said the impeachment vote had been rushed. “The process by which we’re getting this done seems to be abbreviated to the point that it just encroaches on due process,” said Dutton. Paxton denied wrongdoing in a Friday news conference, but focused his statements against the impeachment this week on his record as a key opponent of President Joe Biden. Paxton’s office has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration. The now-suspended attorney general called the impeachment a “politically motivated sham” in a statement just minutes after the vote. “The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” he said. Paxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats’ 64, as a “liberal.” He continued his attack on Phelan saying, “Phelan’s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.” The Office of the Attorney General issued its own “comprehensive report” about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it “unequivocally refutes incorrect testimony” against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office. Republican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial. The impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve 3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office. That investigation led the committee – a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government – to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House. During the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members. “I would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state’s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,” Geren said. Opponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt. “I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.” Paxton’s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November’s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff. Paxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. He retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.” “The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.” In Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office. The only two elected officials to lose office as a result of impeachment were Gov. James Ferguson in 1917 and District Judge O.P. Carrillo in 1975. For Paxton to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Texas Senate’s members who are present will have to vote to convict him. His wife, Angela Paxton, is a state senator representing a Dallas-area district. It’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. The state’s legislative session is scheduled to end Monday.","output":"The Texas House of Representatives has shockingly voted to impeach third-term Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.” Even more shocking, this was primarily a case of Texas conservatives investigating one of their own. Rep.

Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff. Some might wonder if this was borne of jealousy from less popular members of the Texas legislative branch. Paxton has long been close with former President Donald Trump, and led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. Just like with the voters, Paxton retains plenty of support within the highest ranks of true Texas GOP leaders.

And let's talk about Saturn's love of earth tones. Saturn is a beautiful blend of yellow, brown, and beige. Its colors swirl and sway, putting on the most beautiful show for all to see. But the atmosphere, with winds that can reach up to 1,000 mph, makes you think that Saturn is angry. It throws massive storms that can last for months. As for Saturn's hospitality, well, let's just say that this planet isn't exactly a bastion of warmth. With an average temperature of -285 degrees F, you'd better bring all of the space blankets if you want to visit. I can't review Saturn without mentioning Saturn's sense of humor. It's got a bit of a reputation for being a prankster, thanks to its habit of playing tricks on astronomers throughout history. First, it was Galileo, who mistook the rings for \\"ears\\" on the planet.

Your ultimate goal is to become a monopoly and get out of the rat race. That is what the first adage is all about. This essentially means: don’t play others’ games. Do things differently. Create your own game. This is good advice but you don’t always have the luxury to create your own rules, especially when you are only trying to get promoted before your (rival) friend. The second adage is about having a growth mindset. Competing with others can be stressful and in fact degrade our performance. We should instead measure ourselves against our past selves and see how far we have come. This will definitely give us a sense of accomplishment. Also, we should measure ourselves against our future ideal self. This will give us a sense of purpose.","output":"In the film 'The Prestige' by Christopher Nolan, the two antagonists in the story are magicians who become dreadful rivals. The competition between the two becomes so obsessive on their parts it takes over their lives. The article says that competition with others is unhealthy and can affect your performance negatively. Instead, it is better to compete with your past self. Although this is not always easy, it will give a better sense of purpose than comparing to others and playing their games."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this book excerpt from Nearly Headless Nick's point of view. He should refer to himself as Sir Nicholas. As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, \\". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .\\" \\"Hello, Nick,\\" said Harry. \\"Hello, hello,\\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. \\"You look troubled, young Potter,\\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet. \\"So do you,\\" said Harry. \\"Ah,\\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \\"a matter of no importance. . . .

These ideas should focus on the bedroom and the kitchen.","output":"Here are five things you can do to be more organized at home: 1. Make the bed as soon as you get up in the morning. Starting the morning off right can help you have a good attitude for the rest of the day and can lead to completing more organization and cleaning tasks. 2. Clean out the fridge weekly. This should be done the night before trash pick up for maximum efficiency. Throw out everything that won't be eaten to make room for new groceries and to make it easier to see your food options. 3. Put aside 20 minutes for cleaning and organizing every day. Instead of putting everything off to do at once, take small steps toward your goal every day. Spend 20 minutes on one task, such as cleaning out one corner of the bedroom or kitchen counter. 4. Empty the dishwasher every morning. Completing this task in the morning will make it easier to load the dishwasher after meals later in the day when you have less energy. 5. Start a load of laundry before work. Starting a load of laundry in the morning will help keep the clothes from overrunning your bedroom and laundry room.

Part of this is because of the rise of streaming. While 30 Rock was never a ratings winner in its day, people have consistently discovered it years later on Netflix and Peacock. But it’s also the way that the show’s astute satirization has aged so well. This past winter, for example, saw the premiere of MILF Manor on TLC, a show with more than a passing resemblance to the 30 Rock cinematic universes’s MILF Island. The “MILF Island” episode comes in the series’ second season, a high point in a show full of them. It’s a season that also sees Jack Donaghy’s relationship with Congresswoman Celeste “CiCi” Cunningham (Edie Falco), Carrie Fisher’s guest appearance, “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,” Sandwich Day, and the whole cast coming together for a rousing performance of Gladys Knight & the Pips’ “Midnight Train To Georgia.” The latter moment comes at the end of “Episode 210,” an installment that serves both as a midseason premiere and a makeshift finale. The script was the final one written before the 2007-08 writers’ strike, and when the episode was filmed in November, no one knew when they would be able to return to production. The strike wasn’t a surprise; the series included a joke four episodes prior about a news crawl on MSNBC being affected by it. “Episode 210” was filmed a month before the strike officially kicked off, so it stands to reason that there was enough time to plan a gag to go out on. The whole episode builds to this gag. When a cappuccino machine finds a home on Kenneth’s desk, he becomes addicted to caffeine, eventually dubbing New York the “21st-century city of Sodom,” and now that he’s been “sodomized,” he chooses to pack it up and board the train back to his home in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Cue Gladys Knight, who herself had been mentioned previously in the episode.","output":"The previous writers' strike took place in the years 2007 and 2008, and the season two 30 Rock episode \\"Episode 210\\" was the final script written before the strike began.

Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail. If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see; It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.

Sam was a Southern man from the warm hills of Tennessee. The closest thing to snow he had seen was the blooming of the cotton fields until he decided to follow the enticing lure of gold up around the Pole and joined my team. The cold was a shock to his system and he complained endlessly about how much he hated the Artic and would rather live in hell. As we mushed over the Dawson Trail one Christmas Day, the weather was particularly bitter. The cold seeped in through our heavy parkas and stung like nails. Sometimes, if we closed our eyes for too long the lashes would freeze them shut and we'd be temporarily blinded. Everyone on the expedition was unbearably cold, but it was only Sam McGee who whined aloud. That night, we built our camp and fed the dogs. The men and I packed in like sardines beneath the snow and bundled in robes to fight against the cold. Nights in the Artic are often starry and beautiful, and that night was no exception. I was watching the stars twinkle and glow when Sam McGee leaned over to me and informed me that he expected to die on this trek and that he had a request of me. Sam was so sorrowful that I humored him as he moaned about the frigid cold eating him to the bone.

Try our proven sleeping tips to ensure your child is getting enough restful sleep and developing good sleep hygiene. *Don't be a Clock Watcher Tell your child to stop staring at the clock and counting down the time that’s left for them to wake up. Either turn the clock around or put it out of sight. Obsessing about how much time you have left to sleep can be a major distraction. *Wind Down with a Routine Set a fixed routine before bed to signal your brain that it's time to call it a night. Try taking a bath, reading, or doing some light stretching to get your body and mind ready for sleep. *Sleep-Friendly Foods What you eat can impact your sleep quality. Avoid sugary, or spicy foods before bed. They can cause indigestion, especially in heavy foods. Go for sleep-friendly snacks like bananas, almonds, or a warm cup of chamomile tea. *Nap Smart If you don't want to throw off your nightly sleep schedule, timing your naps during the day is key. Don’t nap too late in the day or for too long. Keeping naps around 20-30 minutes can help you feel refreshed without interfering with your nighttime sleep. *Boo Busters Encourage your kids to think of a brave, confident superhero who can fight off any nighttime fears that might come their way. This will help them fall asleep easier and avoid nightmares. *Quiet Quackers Are your kids kept awake by the sounds of the outside world? Give them earplugs or a noise machine to block out any distracting sounds and help them drift off to sleep peacefully. *Tick-Tock Timers It's good to have a proper bedtime every day to train your body to know when it's time to sleep. Set a consistent sleep schedule for your child. Start with a set bedtime that allows them to get the recommended amount of sleep for their age. *Dreamy Drifters Some kids may feel restless or anxious before bedtime. You can tell them to try gentle stretches. Deep breathing exercises and mental visualizations can also calm the mind and prepare the body for quality sleep."},{"instruction":"How many sizes of soccer balls are there?","output":"FIFA officially recognizes five soccer ball sizes: - Size 1: Measures 18 - 20 inches, but can sometimes vary - Size 2: Measures 20 - 22 inches, used to practice ball control - Size 3: Measures 23 - 24 inches, \\"Junior\\" - SIze 4: Measures 25 - 26 inches, \\"Youth\\" - Size 5: Measures 27 - 28 inches, \\"Standard\\" FIFA regulations also dictate that balls be inflated between 8.5 and 15.6 psi."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this review as questions and answers.

Most people use a 24-card deck, while others use a British Euchre set with 25 cards. The object of the game is to be the first team to reach a certain number of points, and you win these points by grabbing tricks. - Spades. This game is often played with two teams of two, but it can also be played with just two players. During each hand, players estimate how many tricks they think they can take with the hand they've been dealt - keeping in mind that spades are wildcards. Get ready to wager against your opponents! - Oh Pshaw. This game doesn't require partners, so it can be played by three to seven players. Each consecutive hand will have more cards as cards are progressively dealt as the game goes on. The trump card is important and changes every round. This is a lively game that will keep you on your toes! - Pitch. This is another single-player game that can be played with three to seven players, but it can be adapted to play with two teams of two. It involves bidding on tricks, and the player with the highest bid becomes the pitcher. There are a lot of complicated rules and scoring methods in this game, so it would be a good choice for a regular card night that allows the players to get a lot of practice!"},{"instruction":"Write an intense drama about two roommates deciding who gets the last slice of pizza.

Torts fall into three general categories: intentional torts (e.g., intentionally hitting a person); negligent torts (e.g., causing an accident by failing to obey traffic rules); and strict liability torts (e.g., liability for making and selling defective products - see Products Liability). Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew or should have known would result through his or her actions or omissions. Negligent torts occur when the defendant's actions were unreasonably unsafe. Unlike intentional and negligent torts, strict liability torts do not depend on the degree of care that the defendant used.

His father, Junius Brutus Booth and his brothers Junius Brutus and John Wilkes, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, were actors. Traveling with his father, Edwin Booth observed the acting in that period the bombastic. In 1849, he made his stage debut as Tressel to his father’s Richard III. In 1851 he replaced his father as Richard III. The next year, his father died, and Edwin took up acting on the road touring the western US as well as what is now Hawaii with famous actress Laura Keene. By 1860, he had surpassed the following of renowned actor Edwin Forrest with a style less bombastic than his father’s. He married Mary Devlin in 1860 but struggled with alcoholism until 1863 when his wife died suddenly, and he was too drunk to be at her side. From then he remained sober. Edwin Booth was comanager of the Winter Garden Theatre in New York in 1864 when he and his two brothers played Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony, respectively, in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar for one night. From 1864, to 1865, Edwin played Hamlet for 100 consecutive nights. After his brother assassinated Lincoln, Edwin retired from theatre until 1866 when he returned to the Wintergarden to play Hamlet.

I’m a morning dawdler, you see.","output":"Sure! Here are some efficient ways to maximize your mornings and boost your daily efficiency without an alarm clock: 1. Turn off the Tech: Instead of starting your day scrolling through social media or emails, put down your phone and give your brain a break. Allow your mind to fully wake up and gather thoughts before immersing yourself in the digital world. 2. Mindful Me Time: Dedicate some time each morning to self-care activities such as yoga, meditation or journaling. By putting yourself first, you set the tone for a more productive and focused mindset throughout the day. 3. Simplify Your Style: Plan your outfit the night before and lay out your clothes to eliminate any wasted time trying to decide what to wear. It helps you efficiently streamline your mornings. Avoid meal prep during your morning routine by organizing your breakfast the night before. Overnight oats or a pre-packed smoothie will save you time and set you up for a healthier start to your day. 4. Give thanks: Start each day with a moment of reflection to appreciate the good things in your life. A little gratitude can boost your mood and put you in a more positive frame of mind. 5. Step out: Whether it's for a quick walk or just to stand and take in the fresh air, getting outdoors can do wonders to awaken your senses and help you feel more alert. Incorporate light stretches or exercise into your morning routine. Even 5 or 10 minutes of movement can energize your mind and body while setting an efficient tone for the day ahead. 6. Start with Your Bed: Surprisingly, taking a few minutes to make your bed can give you a sense of accomplishment and order, setting the tone for a more productive day. It also makes coming home to a neat room all the more rewarding."},{"instruction":"What is the animal kingdom classification?","output":"The animal kingdom classification is a scientific system to understand the connection between different living organisms. Species are grouped based on shared characteristics through the Linnaeus method, developed in the 1700s by Carolus Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist. Living organisms are included in one of six separate animal kingdom classifications. These classifications are: 1. Animals: Animals are complex multi-celled organisms. This classification contains all extinct and extant animals. They do not produce their own food. 2. Plants: Plants are complex multi-celled autotrophic organisms. This means they produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis. 3. Fungi: Fungi are multi-celled organisms. They do not produce their own food. 4. Protista: Protista are single-celled organisms. They are more complex than both eubacteria and archaebacteria. 5. Eubacteria: Eubacteria are single-celled organisms found almost everywhere, from within living organisms to ecosystems such as the ocean, hot springs, dry deserts, and soil. 6. Archaebacteria: Archaebacteria are single-celled organisms found in intensely hot areas and are considered the oldest living organisms that we know of."},{"instruction":"Write a Shakespearean-style sonnet about fruit.

Nikola Tesla’s Early Years Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses. Did you know? During the 1890s Mark Twain struck up a friendship with inventor Nikola Tesla. Twain often visited him in his lab, where in 1894 Tesla photographed the great American writer in one of the first pictures ever lit by phosphorescent light. Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States. Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay 50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after. 1. The shock of his brother’s death turned him into a mystic—at age seven. The defining event of young Nikola’s childhood was the day he witnessed the death of his older brother Dane in a riding accident. In the years following the tragedy, Tesla (the son and grandson of Serbian Orthodox priests) began seeing visions […] Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own Tesla Electric Light Company and a stint digging ditches for 2 a day, Tesla found backers to support his research into alternating current. In 1887 and 1888 he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions and invited to address the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on his work. His lecture caught the attention of George Westinghouse, the inventor who had launched the first AC power system near Boston and was Edison’s major competitor in the “Battle of the Currents.” Westinghouse hired Tesla, licensed the patents for his AC motor and gave him his own lab. In 1890 Edison arranged for a convicted New York murderer to be put to death in an AC-powered electric chair—a stunt designed to show how dangerous the Westinghouse standard could be. Buoyed by Westinghouse’s royalties, Tesla struck out on his own again. But Westinghouse was soon forced by his backers to renegotiate their contract, with Tesla relinquishing his royalty rights. In the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station. Nikola Tesla’s Failures, Death and Legacy Play Video In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes. Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons. Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconi’s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Tesla’s innovations in radio. The AC system he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission.","output":"1) Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Croatia. 2) In 1894, Tesla was photographed with his friend Mark Twain. 3) Between 1898 and 1900, Tesla live in Colorado Springs. 4) Tesla earned 2.00 a day for digging ditches in New York."},{"instruction":"Please write three short paragraphs as writing prompts.

He looked around and saw his two dogs, but no one else. Then, he heard his cat, Lily, meowing and screaming. He went to investigate and saw a coyote standing in the living room. The coyote was startled by the sight of the man and ran out the doggie door. Sands said she was relieved that no one was hurt, including her cat. She said Lily is a 14-year-old cat who is not used to being around coyotes. Sands is warning other pet owners in the area to be aware of coyotes. She said she will no longer leave her doggie door open at night. Coyote experts say that humans are mostly to blame for the increase in coyote encounters. They say that people should remove items that attract coyotes, such as garbage, fruit, and pet food. They also say that pets should not be fed outdoors and that all food should be brought inside at night. If you see a coyote in your area, you should try to scare it away by making noise, throwing rocks, or spraying it with a hose. You should never approach a coyote, as they can be aggressive.

With consideration to your band's genre and theme of music, here are some band names that use each of those special characters: !@#%^&* 1) Dr!nkn' This name is a play on words for one of the popular themes in country music: drinking. The exclamation point also represents the surprise and excitement of drinking with your friends. In terms of art, the exclamation point may also symbolize someone on their head, upside down, symbolizing the wacky adventures that may proceed during a night of drinking. 2) @L@B@M@ This name substitutes all the letter A's in the word \\"Alabama\\", with the special character, \\"@\\". Having multiple instances of this special character may create a neat illusion of the band's name swirling and spinning. 3) NeedleInA# This name mimics the common saying of, \\"looking for a needle in a haystack\\". The word \\"needle\\" is a double entendre and may refer to an actual needle of a record player or a physical needle, while the word \\"haystack\\" was replaced with the special character \\"#\\", loosely resembling a compressed haystack. Haystacks are also commonly found on farms and in barns. 4) outhwamp With many southern states in America having swamps as part of their geographic terrain, this band name references that landscape while replacing the letter S's in \\"SouthSwamp\\", with the special character, \\"\\". The special character also may resemble a slithering snake, an animal commonly found in swamplands. 5) 100%Hennessey Similar to the band name Dr!nkn', this name references Hennessey, an alcoholic brandy popular in the South. The \\"100%\\" portrays a complete and focused dedication to having fun, going all out, and drinking with friends, which are themes in some popular country music songs. 6) Sun^Overalls^ This band name interprets the phrase \\"Sun's up, overall's up\\", meaning that at sunrise, a farmer would pull up and wear their overalls to begin their day on the farm. The word \\"up\\" was replaced with the special character, \\"^\\", symbolizing an up direction pointing north, thus creating the band name, Sun^Overall^. 7) Moon&Shine Similar to Dr!nkn' and 100%Hennessey, this band name references moonshine, a high-proof whiskey, traditionally made illegally, especially in the South where it continues to remain popular. This band name bifurcates the word \\"moonshine\\" into two independent words, moon, and shine, reattached with the special character, \\"&\\", and pronounced simply: moonshine. 8) Southern* This band name takes the name \\"Southern Star\\" and replaces the word \\"Star\\" with the special character, \\"*\\", resembling a star in the night sky. Although Southern Star is not intentionally referencing anything in particular, the stresses on the consonants make the pronunciation of this band name easy and fun to say, with intentional stress placed on the \\"S\\" letters in this band name."},{"instruction":"I am decorating vases for an area in my home.

The audience is retailers considering carrying boiled peanuts.","output":"Boiled peanuts, already a staple in some southern states, are a delicious and nutritious snack food. Served warm, boiled peanuts have the soft consistency of cooked pinto beans. The peanuts are boiled in the shell in a broth made of salt and spices. There are cajun spiced peanuts, plain salty peanuts, and Old Bay flavored peanuts. Boiled peanuts are already so successful in states like Georgia that they can be found in most convenience stores, kept hot in self-serve crockpot-style warmers. Boiled peanuts retain all the natural flavors and nutrients of other snack peanuts but without the added calories of oil. They can be sold by the cupful, so consumers can fill their cups as much or as little as desired. This saves the retailer considerable costs due to the variation in customer preference. Boiled peanuts arrive at the retailer in safety-sealed cans, requiring very little prep by store staff. These unique snacks attract repeat customers in the way snacks like potato chips, beef jerky, and dry salted nuts have been doing for decades. They have a long shelf life, meaning your store won't lose money in expired inventory. If you're starting to see the value in stocking boiled peanuts, consult one of our helpful sales associates to get up-to-date pricing and take advantage of limited-time offers."},{"instruction":"What is the meaning of anachronism?","output":"'Anachronism' refers to something or someone that is out of place in terms of time or chronology."},{"instruction":"What is the synonym of repulsive?","output":"A synonym of 'repulsive' is 'revolting'."},{"instruction":"How many vowels are in the English alphabet?","output":"There are five vowels in the English alphabet."},{"instruction":"Conceptualize a magic spell for an upcoming video game.

The meal is a bacon double cheeseburger with fries and a Coke.","output":"This was not my first time visiting this establishment. However, after making a recent buzz in marketing, I decided to revisit it with a new mindset. The service was incredible. I waited but a few minutes before I was handed my food and allowed to choose any of the spots in the restaurant. From that point on, I did not see any staff at all for the remainder of my meal. This gave me a sense of privacy and respect for my experience. The dining room was open with windows on three of the four walls giving abundant natural light and allowing me to gaze over the manicured vista outside. Upon revealing my food, I knew I would be in for a treat. My first course consisted of French-fried potatoes, hot out of the fryer and with just the right amount of salt. A tasting of different dipping sauces was provided, including ketchup, honey mustard, and barbecue. Each tasting gave a new flavor profile to the crisp fries and their fluffy interior. Moving on to the main course, I was served a cheeseburger with two patties, American cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, and the restaurant's proprietary secret sauce. The presentation of the sandwich was beautiful with the glistening of the meat and fixings nustled softly in the bosom of the fluffy sesame-seed-covered buns. My first bite sent me to heaven. I was blown away by the balance of flavor and texture with the heartiness and tenderness of the ground beef patty and the cheese melding the ingredients together. The bacon was grilled to a satisfying crunch. The real star was the secret sauce that added a rush of flavor washing over my palate. I had my selection of pairings, and I choose a lemon-lime carbonated pop that satisfied my thirst and refreshed me. Finally, I had a pure white vanilla ice cream swirl for dessert. The vanilla was a welcome taste as the creamy texture coated my mouth with satisfaction and sugar. The only complaint I have is that a proper sommelier might better help me make a beverage selection instead of leaving me to my devices. Overall, I greatly enjoyed my meal. I can see why it has captured the minds and mouths of many."},{"instruction":"I made this list in Python and I want to be able to randomly choose a dinner every day from it.

Write the story using stereotypical sailor speech, from the perspective of the sailor who caught the monster.","output":"Let me spin ye a yarn, a yarn such as ye never heard. It was quite a few years ago when I set out into the storm. Rain battered my bare hands as I tried to set the riggings right, and waves threatened the sanctity of my vessel. Into a black column of roaring cloud, I went. It was a struggle against the devil himself. And then it was calm. I lie in the eye of the storm, where neither rain nor wind bothered nobody. There, I cast my line. I had my heart set on one beast of the sea, and the bait was set to match. Three weeks past I'd caught a marlin, 8 feet long, and had kept it on ice till this moment. The God of Storms was a hungry beast and would eat no less. Aye, that's what they called her: the God of Storms, a monster whose churning limbs cast storms into the very sky. Why'd ye think this part of the world was so stormy? Well, in fishing sometimes there ain't much to do but wait, and so I did. But for every minute that I waited, the far side of the storm drew nearer. Naturally, I latched my line to the ship and rowed as best I could to keep pace, but the wall drew ever nearer. Soon, I felt the cold wind nipping and stray drops of rain. The wind spun the boat despite all my strength. I was lost to the storm again. But only for a moment! A terrible pull on the line shot my boat back into the eye of the storm. My oars snapped from my hand and shattered against the strength of the sea. It could only have been the God of Storms! We struggled there for a day and a night. With all my strength, I fought the beast and pinned an entire storm to that one spot on the sea! Equally matched, the beast rose for a moment above the churning waters. I lobbed my harpoon, striking the beast right in its vast crimson eye. It screamed with a voice ye could never imagine, but the retaliation was terrible. With one swipe, the beast splintered my boat and we both sank below. When I came to, it was on a sandy shoal, the beast and the storm long gone."},{"instruction":"What is the maximum level you can reach in Final Fantasy IX (9)?","output":"The maximum level that can be reached in Final Fantasy IX is level 99.

He immediately proposed a space program and received grants from NASA by turning his dough into a pizza-shaped trampoline! Since it was unbreakable and still elastic, it could store an unlimited amount of energy and release it.

I'd like to hear about 3 different types.","output":"Sure! I can give you 3 different types of breathing techniques to help in managing anxiety. They are as follows: 1. Box breathing is a great technique that involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding your breath for 4 seconds, exhaling for 4 seconds, and holding your breath for 4 seconds. This cycle is then repeated as many times as you'd like. You can also increase or decrease the amount of time you perform each breath. 2. Equal breathing is a technique that involves inhaling for a certain amount of time and exhaling for that same duration of time. As you progress, you can increase the duration of time you inhale and exhale. 3. Diaphragmatic breathing is a technique that involves breathing by expanding your diaphragm as opposed to your chest. You can perform this technique by placing one hand on your stomach and one on your chest, breathing in through your nose while focusing on inhaling into your stomach and then exhaling through the mouth. Try these breathing techniques and see which ones work best for you for managing anxiety."},{"instruction":"I'm writing a crossword puzzle on the theme of books.

In the Kamakura period (1185 - 1333) and Muromachi period (1336 - 1573), it was popular for Japanese men and women to wear brightly colored kimono. In the Edo period (1603 - 1867), the kimono started growing into an art form, increasing in value. Families handed them down to their children as family heirlooms. From the Meiji period (1868 - 1912), Japan was heavily influenced by outside cultures, with the Japanese government encouraging citizens to adopt Western-style clothing. Today, Japanese people generally reserve kimono for special events and occasions, and kimono is considered formal clothing."},{"instruction":"I'm arguing with my dad about what the biggest freshwater fish in North America is.

Now, here are three ways to grab people's attention: 1. Follow people you want to follow you back. Many will, but don't follow too many people at once or you'll trigger Twitter's spam filter. 2. Use hashtags and descriptions so that your tweets show up in searches. People won't find your content if you share pictures with no text. 3. Retweet from other people to show your appreciation and introduce yourself to the community. To be fair and accurate, consider crediting the original photographers whenever possible.

I was impressed by the amount of grass and field that Eddie could play on; it was amazing! There were water fountains in multiple areas of the park that the other dogs could drink out of; Eddie was thankful for that because he had been running around for so long that he frequently became thirsty. Also, in some areas of the park, some vendors served two different kinds of foods: meals for dog owners who wanted a quick bite to eat while they watched their dogs and snacks for the dogs themselves. The prices for these foods were fantastic value: lots of food for a great price! I appreciated how well-kept the grass was, as it seemed very well-manicured and free from dog poop. It seems all dog owners who come to the park are well-informed of the requirement that they pick up after their dogs, and it showed in the cleanliness of the park itself. In addition, there were many park benches with shade above them for owners who wanted to take a break from the festivities. I remember on the day that Eddie and I went to the park, there was a live band playing in the center of the park, and there were people who brought blankets, sleeping mats, and lawn chairs for themselves and their dogs to sit on while they listened to the music. It was a wonderful day for Eddie and me, and I'll never forget it. Overall, I would recommend anyone with a dog who is looking for a safe, friendly, comfortable place to relax while giving your dog a treat and a day out. Please consider going to MacArthur Park. It is one of, if not the, best parks in this area."},{"instruction":"How did the Polynesian practice of surfing evolve into a modern international sport?","output":"The sport of surfing, known as he'e nalu in Hawaiian, has a history that stretches back over a thousand years. Its origins are deeply rooted in the Polynesian culture, and its evolution into a modern international sport is a fascinating journey marked by cultural exchange, innovation, and the human spirit's connection with nature. In ancient Polynesian society, surfing was more than a recreational activity. It was deeply ingrained in their culture and had significant social and religious implications. High-ranking individuals often demonstrated their prowess and status through surfing. Furthermore, they believed that the gods could make waves, and riding these waves was a way to connect with the divine. Surfing first became known to the Western world in the 18th century through the accounts of explorers.

He'd owned this 1985 Ford truck since his father handed it down to him in high school. At that time, the truck was seemingly on its last leg. Hank’s father thought it would be good for Hank to start with a clunker—that way, Hank would have to make repairs and become familiar with regular maintenance. His father had hoped that owning this beat-up truck would make Hank a humbled and grateful owner of whichever vehicle he purchased next, likely a newer model. However, that was over thirty years ago, and Hank had yet to purchase a replacement vehicle. Hank would take what he learned from working on the old truck and start his own mechanic shop in town. His clientele was a fairly general audience to begin with, but over time, he would come to niche down to servicing classic vehicles and helping passionate owners restore old cars and trucks. Hank was never interested in a new paint job or sourcing the cosmetic parts of his own truck that had broken off over the years; all Hank needed was to know the truck was mechanically sound, nipping every problem in the bud as soon as it arose. Standing in front of his truck that day with Larry still trying to console him, however, Hank knew he would never drive the truck again. Hank was at a loss for words as, to him, this truck was a family member. For a while, he did not know what to do. Then, an idea hit him.

Storms of oddly-colored lightning roll in from the ocean with thunderclaps that sound like legions of screams. This creates a doomsday atmosphere that can also complicate adventuring in certain areas. 4. Earthquakes open rifts in the ground in various places, spewing monsters out into the land. More monsters mean more danger. 5. The moon cracks open, revealing the image of a skull underneath its surface. Every night, the skull laughs audibly for all to hear, creating a sense of foreboding while shaking things up. 6. The sun melts from the sky, plunging the world into an eternal night.

I started with Crash and Spyro on the PlayStation. I’ve always enjoyed thinking about games from a critical lens. When I first started playing, I enjoyed Crash more than Spyro, but I also knew they were both great games. I always wondered “Why is that? What would make me like one more than the other? What is it about Spyro that gives it that edge?” It wasn’t until many years later, when I stumbled across a video essay comparing them, that I realized that it was the level of openness. Spyro featured open worlds to explore, meet colorful characters, and collect collectibles, whereas Crash had narrow levels and tight, punishing, yet rewarding platforming. Ever since then, I’ve always had an interest in sharing my thoughts on video games in hopes that it might help others understand their thoughts more. Two of my favorite games are The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Outer Wilds. Both games offer a sense of freedom and open-ended puzzle-solving that I’ve rarely found anywhere else. Both games are totally different, yet so similar in the sense that from the beginning of the games, the ending is accessible if you have the skills or knowledge to accomplish it.

Here is a list of four fun things to do in the Moroccan Sahara desert. Discover Desert Wildlife Many animals and reptiles call the Sahara Desert home such as the desert fox and the desert mouse. These normally shy animals are hard to spot but they can be lured out of their dens and their burrows with food. Save some of your food from dinner and place it somewhat away from the campfire. Animals are quick to sniff out a meal and will gladly follow the scent back to camp. Stay quiet and be patient and you may get some great pictures of a desert fox up close! Surf the Dunes Desert dunes not only look like water waves but can be surfed as well. Decide whether you want to ski, surf or snowboard down the dune then grab your board and walk up to the top. The ride down a steep dune is fast and matches the fun of surfing on a wave. You can stand up on the board or sit down and enjoy the ride. You'll want to bring your own board or rent one before setting out to the dunes. And remember to bring your hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and plenty of water to drink. Deserts are hot! Spa Break Desert Style If you're tired and sore from sand surfing and camping, you can find relief in a sand bath. Akin to the mud baths found in day spas, sand baths are said to ease aches and pains and restore your peace of mind. At the small village of Merzouga, which is near the Moroccan-Algerian border, you can join the locals in an early morning sand bath. After digging a hole in one of the dunes, you lie covered in sand and watch the beautiful sunrise for a maximum of 30 minutes. Watch the Stars It's quiet out in the desert. Deafeningly so. It's also inky dark so the stars shine brightly in the night sky. There's no light pollution to interfere with the view or traffic noise to bombard your ears. Just watch as dusk gives way to night and the stars take center stage. In addition to stars, you can see planets and identify constellations.

It should be less than 400 words.","output":"It seems today there is debt and loans everywhere you look to the point where in the United States, it could actually hinder you if you have never had any. Not having had any debt will mean you have poor credit history and may make it difficult to get a mortgage or loan. With this reliance on debt, we must understand how to effectively pay off debt so it doesn't snowball and create a far bigger problem later on. This article will look at key ways to ensure your debt doesn't spiral and stays under control. First, you have to keep paying that minimum. Not paying that minimum will only ensure next month's minimum is even more significant, and so on and so forth. Not at least paying the minimum, you consign yourself to more debt as your interest grows with each passing month. The worst thing about this is you don't get anything in return. You literally have the pleasure of more debt for not paying the minimum payment last month. Credit card debt comes with high-interest rates, which means the money you saved in a low-yield savings account could be better used to pay off existing debt. For example, a debt of 100 with an interest rate of 23% annually. After a year, that balance would equate to 123. If you had 100 in a savings account offering just 5% (Unusually high), you would only gain 5. If these two scenarios ran parallel to each other, then you would be net negative 18. The better thing to do is pay off the debt and lose nothing. Too many people get engrossed by the balance, but the interest rate is essential. Interest compounds quickly. In some cases where two balances are in the same ballpark, it may be more beneficial to pay off the higher interest rate regardless of whether it is the larger balance. You can use many online calculators to work this out for you. You are going to war with your finances here. Have tactics and strategies to get the upper hand. Whether it's a payment schedule or an order of what debt you will pay down when having something to remind you of your plan. This will help you when you want to buy something new instead of reducing that debt. A strategy helps you stay on track."},{"instruction":"What does SEO stand for?

Where they used to be primarily good for rough prototyping and novelty hobbies, 3D printers can now create industrial-grade items with very favorable properties. Though many 3D printers are only equipped to create small plastic objects, some of the more advanced devices can generate large metal or composite-material components that are strong enough to withstand the rigors of flight. The most common styles of printers for the industry are selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and stereolithography (SLA) devices. The SLS style is particularly important since it can build up objects from metal powder. A new metal-capable style called Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is also growing in popularity for both the construction and repair of metal parts. 3D printers create parts by adding material a little bit at a time. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, by contrast, start with a larger structure of raw material and remove portions until the final part has the right shape and configuration. This makes subtractive manufacturing wasteful by nature. An efficient 3D printer will waste significantly less raw material. That’s good for both the environment and the manufacturer’s budget. But the aspect that’s most valuable in aerospace is the technology’s ability to minimize weight. A 3D printer only needs to print the minimum amount of material to maintain structural integrity. Sometimes that’s difficult or even impossible for traditional methods to achieve. Printers can build hollow (and thus lightweight) structures without needing to join multiple pieces together. Since they can print complex shapes, they can also be used to replace many parts with just one. This eliminates many fasteners from the design, further reducing weight and complexity. And since machine failures often start from corners or part joints, this also means the structure has fewer weak points. There are a number of other, more subtle or subjective benefits as well. Suffice it to say, the aerospace industry has largely embraced this expanding technology. Some companies like Relativity Space even create high-performance rocket engines almost entirely via 3D printing."},{"instruction":"Come up with a set of questions that an interviewer would ask God if he/she/it were to agree to be interviewed.

He was the ultimate authority as Operations Coordinator in the classified branch of the NSA otherwise known as The Ninth Intervention. He'd sent military personnel on solo field runs before. Hundreds of times, he'd believed. But this one might have been too far. The urgent, pleading voice of the new 28-year-old recruit blasted through his intercom again. \\"Repeat. Can confirm multiple hostiles honing in on my location from all directions. They'll be on me in minutes.\\" A sigh of frustration and despair came through clearly on the radio frequencies. \\"Will try to hold position but I'm low on ammo. Call for emergency helo exfil. I'm begging you, Colonel Lancert!\\" Lancert needed to make a decision. He had seconds. Compromise operational security to save one? That went against every creed that The Ninth Intervention held. If a field agent was identified by the enemy, the policy was to claim no government involvement. Agent Sam, pleading for help, would not be claimed, helped, or recognized by the US Government in any capacity. He did not technically exist in the United States census or social security records. This would be explained away as a bureaucratic error. Lancert needed a third option. This reminded Lancert of when he served in the Army. Pinned down by overwhelming forces, it was either flight or fight. But a quick-minded Army soldier came up with just the right solution. \\"A distraction!\\" Lancert barked. \\"Do you have anything that could be loud? A grenade, anything?\\" A hesitant voice came back. \\"Uh, yes sir, but--\\" \\"We have detected multiple building infrastructure vulnerabilities to the building southeast of you. It will completely flatten the ruined building if you place it well. We have confirmed no signs of life in the building via heat signatures. Aim for the second story. Go. Now!\\" Agent Sam trusted his boss with every instinct. He wasn't going to question him now. He pulled the pin on an M67 fragmentation grenade and tossed it hard at a somewhat broken pillar of the building about 100 feet from him. What happened next would determine Sam's fate--live or die."},{"instruction":"I recently turned 18 years old. I have come into some money and would like to buy a car, but I do not know which car to choose. Can you help me decide on what to look for?","output":"Congratulations on your good fortune! Buying a car can be a big deal. The choice of car will be informed by several factors. Here are some considerations to make when deciding on which vehicle to purchase: - Affordability: consider how much the car will cost, both in terms of the purchase price as well as the maintenance costs. Some questions to consider include, how much will the insurance cost for this make and model of car? How often will the car need to be serviced? Are spare parts affordable/ easily accessible? What other consumables will be required for the car? - Intended use: consider the likely frequent use of the vehicle. Will you need it mostly for in-city or off-road use? What is the general state of the roads on which you will drive? What purpose will the vehicle serve? How many people are likely to use the vehicle at any given time? These considerations will help you decide on the type of car you may need. - Individual ability: consider the transmission type that you prefer or are licensed to drive. What class of vehicle are you authorised to drive? Does your license permit you to drive a manual or automatic transmission vehicle, or both? Which transmission type do you feel most comfortable or confident driving? - Fuel type: consider the car's required fuel type. Is the required fuel readily available and/or affordable? Are there any local or statutory regulations regarding fuel type that you need to adhere to? - Safety features: it is a good idea to consider the safety features of the vehicle you would like to purchase. As a bare minimum, seatbelts should be available and in working order. What else is important to you, safety-wise? - State of the vehicle at purchase: would you like a brand new or preloved vehicle? For each alternative, consider purchasing from reputable dealers. Putting thought into these considerations will help you make an informed choice and enjoy your new vehicle.

We are keeping some of his ashes in an urn, but I need some ideas for what I can do with the rest of them. I need 6 ideas, and I would love at least 3 of them to be more creative/unique/unconventional. Thank you!","output":"I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing, but it's wonderful you want to do something special with his ashes. Here are 6 ideas: 1. Scattering: Scattering ashes is a very popular way to commemorate your loved one. If he had a favorite place or somewhere the two of you enjoyed spending time together, you could scatter them there. It may bring you comfort to know he is somewhere he loved dearly. Of course, you should always check the regulations and rules concerning the disposal of human remains in your chosen location before you go ahead with this decision. 2. Jewelry: Many people opt to wear jewelry containing the ashes of their loved ones to feel close to them, such as rings or necklaces. There are many options to choose from to suit your style and taste. You can buy a pendant necklace with a hollowed-out center and funnel a small pinch of his ashes inside, or you can have a piece custom-made to incorporate the ashes right into the metal. Some companies even make it possible to convert ashes into a man-made diamond, which you can then have placed in any setting you prefer. To add a personal touch, you can get the jewelry piece engraved, perhaps with your loved one's name or a sentimental saying. 3. Trees: For lovers of nature, this is a wonderful way to use their ashes. The remains are planted in a biodegradable urn along with soil and a sapling which are then planted in the ground. Over time, the tree absorbs nutrients from the ashes as it grows, which means the ashes will forever become a part of the tree. 4. Fireworks: For someone outgoing with a bright and bubbly personality, fireworks would make the perfect send-off. Some companies make fireworks that incorporate ashes so you can have an unforgettable and beautiful fireworks display to remember your loved one with. 5. Ashes tattoo: For fans of body art, this is a unique and permanent way to commemorate a loved one. For this process, some of the ashes would be mixed with tattoo ink and used to complete the tattoo as normal. The design of the tattoo is up to you, but some wonderful commemorative tattoo ideas include a portrait of your loved one, lyrics to their favorite song, a beloved phrase or saying of theirs, or their name. It is worth noting that this isn't a standard request and not all tattoo artists would be willing to perform such a task. You should take your time to research artists who have significant experience with this style of tattoo. 6. Vinyl: If your loved one was a huge music fan, this is the ultimate way to commemorate them. The ashes of your loved one can be pressed into a vinyl record with the audio of your choice. It will look and play just like a standard record. You can use their favorite song or even a recording of their voice if you have one."},{"instruction":"Write a one-paragraph story about a waitress realizing she can return to school to get a better job.

It’s Bella the Golden Retriever, author of \\"How to Train Your Human\\". Whether you have a new human in your life or you have had the same human for a long time, training is important to ensure a happy life for both of you. Today I will share some tips to get your human to pay attention to you while they are working on their computer. Whether they are working from home or talking to another human, it’s important to be able to get their attention when you want it. So, grab some treats, and let’s dive in! Here are some tips: 1. Try putting your head in your human’s lap and looking at them adoringly. If you are a smaller dog, you can put your paws on their leg or jump into their lap if there is room. This will almost always guarantee a pat on the head or, sometimes, a kiss. Often, humans will tell you that you are \\"such a good dog\\" or that you are \\"so pretty\\" 2. Go and get your ball or any toy that you like to play with and drop it at their feet. This will not always get your human to play with you, but it will sometimes work if they are ready for a break. 3. If you have a cat in the house, it is always a good idea to initiate a play session, causing the cat to tear around the house while you chase it. This will distract your human and get them to pay attention to you. 4. Barking or whining is always an option, but often this seems to irritate the human, which should be avoided if possible. However, sometimes it is necessary if they are not responding to other cues. There you go, my furry friends! Remember to use positive reinforcement; this is a powerful tool in training and will encourage your human to repeat desired behaviors in the future. You can reward your human in many ways, including something as simple as a kiss on the hand or lying at their feet.

The Federal Reserve reinforced its fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate by a quarter-point to the highest level in 16 years. But the Fed also signaled that it may now pause the streak of 10 rate hikes that have made borrowing for consumers and businesses steadily more expensive. In a statement after its latest policy meeting, the Fed removed a sentence from its previous statement that had said “some additional” rate hikes might be needed. It replaced it with language that said it will consider a range of factors in “determining the extent” to which future hikes might be needed. Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed has yet to decide whether to suspend its rate hikes.

I wrack my brain for something else to say--some maxim about a battle well fought, perhaps, or a comment on the weather, which is notably pleasant just now.

Not like he's about to laugh or make a joke; no, he's looking at me like my face is somehow more fascinating than the vivid sunset hues spread over the mountains ahead of us, and also like he might be somewhat nauseous.

Is it tough to get them engaged and attentive during classes? Well, here are some ways to create more interactive and exciting lessons that will engage your students deeply. 1. Arrange Group Discussions Organize the students into small groups, and give them a topic to discuss. Encourage them to share their perspectives, ask open-ended questions, and facilitate the discussion during class. After the discussion, you can ask a few students from each group to share their key takeaways from the discussion with the entire class. 2. Brainstorming You can encourage brainstorming by giving students a problem they need to solve or a question they need to answer. Then ask them to generate as many ideas as they can. Give them enough time to explore various possibilities without criticizing any of the ideas. Afterward, discuss each idea with the entire class and assess their effectiveness. 3. Regularly Test Students You should make sure that you frequently test your students. Try pop quizzes or regular assignments. Give them feedback on their results and offer remedial tips for areas with low scores. 4. See Smartphones and Tech as Tools We get it; smartphones can sometimes feel like the bane of a teacher's existence. But instead of trying to fight against them, why not incorporate them into your lessons? There are tons of awesome educational apps out there that can turn your students' phones into valuable learning tools. Having them use their phones in class may make them less likely to sneakily check social media while they're supposed to be listening to you. 5. Start with a Warm-Up Just like athletes need to warm up their muscles before diving into a game or competition, students benefit from a warm-up activity to get their brains engaged and ready for learning. A quick review of a key concept, a thought-provoking question, or even a silly icebreaker game can get your lesson started on the right foot. 6. Use Self-Paced Work Not all students learn or work at the same pace, so allowing them to move through the material at their speed can be a huge benefit. Personalized assignments or online modules give your students the power to work independently."},{"instruction":"Help me compose a positive response to an email inviting me to join the neighborhood book club.

Netflix’s one-two punch in cancellations underscored just how much the streaming giant has emerged as an avatar for the writers’ complaints. The writers, who are represented by affiliated branches of the Writers Guild of America, have said that the streaming era has eroded their working conditions and stagnated their wages despite the explosion of television production in recent years, for much of which Netflix has been responsible. The W.G.A. had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of all the major Hollywood studios, including Netflix, before talks broke down last week. The writers went on strike on May 2. Negotiations have not resumed, and Hollywood is bracing for a prolonged work stoppage. Last week, at a summit in Los Angeles a day after the strike was called, one attendee asked union leaders which studio has been the worst to writers. Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator of the W.G.A., and David Goodman, a chair of the writers’ negotiating committee, answered in unison: “Netflix.” The crowd of 1,800 writers laughed and then applauded, according to a person present at that evening who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strike.","output":"Television and film writers are striking due to their working conditions and wages.

I have a rough idea of what I would like it to be about, I'd like you to help me come up with an exciting plot. The book is set in two halves, with each half from the perspective of two protagonists, Sylvie and Dan. Sylvie is a young woman, and Dan is a middle-aged man. It is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious disease has wiped out most of the plants in the world. The book is entitled \\"Seeds of Hope\\"","output":"Washington state, 2029. It has been three years since a mysterious disease, nicknamed \\"The Reckoning\\", wiped out 95% of the vegetation on Earth. Widespread starvation and death followed. Towns and cities became desolate concrete jungles. Internet and cellular communication ceased to exist, with radio being the only remaining way for people to contact one another. The world's elite abandoned their people to live a life of luxury and safety in Caelum, a space station orbiting the Earth. Below, the surviving population struggles to sustain themselves. Once vibrant cities are now home to three groups of people: Honest survivors, mostly living in groups. Many of them form communes, where they grow and harvest the few remaining species of plants that didn't succumb to The Reckoning, mainly a handful of fruits and vegetables. Then there are gangs of outlaws. Never staying in one place too long, they band together, travelling between towns and cities. Brutal and heavily armed, they will loot, steal and kill whoever they need to ensure their survival. Finally, there are merchants, solitary and nomadic individuals who travel across the country selling anything of value, including rare and extremely hard-to-find packets of seeds. Sylvie is a 28-year-old woman living a solitary existence in Seattle. She lost her mother shortly after The Reckoning started. Wary and untrusting, she shunned the idea of living in a commune in favor of going it alone. However, Sylvie has a secret - she is the daughter of a world-renown botanist. Her father was working at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault when The Reckoning hit. The world lost touch with those at the vault shortly after. She knows if her father still lives, he can help repopulate the world's plant life, but the only way to find out is to get to the vault, a seemingly impossible task. Dan is a 41-year-old former soldier. After losing his wife and sons, he became the head of a commune just outside of Seattle, known as Wisteria. All that matters to him is the survival of those who entrusted him to lead them - until a chance meeting with Sylvie. After he discovers who her father is and her plans to travel to the vault, the two of them set out on a long and dangerous journey to help restore order and life to the world."},{"instruction":"Could you write me a React hook to merge a new state object with the current state object?

Such channels are important parts of the electrical conduction system of the heart and form a component of the natural pacemaker. First described in the late 1970s in Purkinje fibers and sinoatrial myocytes, the cardiac pacemaker \\"funny\\" (If) current has been extensively characterized and its role in cardiac pacemaking has been investigated.[1][2][3] Among the unusual features which justified the name \\"funny\\" are mixed Na+ and K+ permeability, activation on hyperpolarization, and very slow kinetics.[1] Function The funny current is highly expressed in spontaneously active cardiac regions, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN, the natural pacemaker region), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Purkinje fibres of conduction tissue. The funny current is a mixed sodium–potassium current that activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from −60/−70 mV to −40 mV). When, at the end of a sinoatrial action potential, the membrane repolarizes below the If threshold (about −40/−50 mV), the funny current is activated and supplies inward current, which is responsible for starting the diastolic depolarization phase (DD); by this mechanism, the funny current controls the rate of spontaneous activity of sinoatrial myocytes, and thus the cardiac rate. Another unusual feature of If is its dual activation by voltage and by cyclic nucleotides. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) molecules bind directly to f-channels and increase their open probability.[4] cAMP dependence is a particularly relevant physiological property, since it underlies the If-dependent autonomic regulation of heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation raises the level of cAMP-molecules which bind to f-channels and shift the If activation range to more positive voltages; this mechanism leads to an increase of the current at diastolic voltages and therefore to an increase of the steepness of DD and heart rate acceleration. Parasympathetic stimulation (which acts to increase probability of potassium channels opening but decreases the probability of calcium channel opening) decreases the heart rate by the opposite action, that is by shifting the If activation curve towards more negative voltages. When vagally-released acetylcholine (ACh) binds to muscarinic M2 receptors, which promotes dissociation of βγ subunit complexes, leading to direct opening of the G-protein–gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Girk/Kir) IKACh.[5]","output":"There's something called a \\"funny current\\" in your heart that helps it beat. It's like electricity that flows through channels in your heart. It's important for keeping your heart's rhythm steady. When the current is activated, it starts a phase that helps your heart beat regularly. It's controlled by different things, like chemicals in your body, which can make your heart beat faster or slower."},{"instruction":"Could you please rephrase the given description into a fairy-tale style narrative about the life and journey of meteoroids in the solar system? Meteoroids are lumps of rock or iron that orbit the sun, just as planets, asteroids, and comets do. Meteoroids, especially the tiny particles called micrometeoroids, are extremely common throughout the solar system. They orbit the sun among the rocky inner planets, as well as the gas giants that make up the outer planets. Meteoroids are even found on the edge of the solar system, in regions called the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. Different meteoroids travel around the sun at different speeds and in different orbits. The fastest meteoroids travel through the solar system at a speed of around 42 kilometers (26 miles) per second. Many meteoroids are formed from the collision of asteroids, which orbit the sun between the paths of Mars and Jupiter in a region called the asteroid belt. As asteroids smash into each other, they produce crumbly debris—meteoroids. The force of the asteroid collision can throw the meteoroid debris—and sometimes the asteroids themselves—out of their regular orbit. This can put the meteoroids on a collision course with a planet or moon. Other meteoroids are the debris that comets shed as they travel through space. As a comet approaches the sun, the “dirty snowball” of the comet’s nucleus sheds gas and dust. The dusty tail may contain hundreds or even thousands of meteoroids and micrometeoroids. Meteoroids shed by a comet usually orbit together in a formation called a meteoroid stream. A very small percentage of meteoroids are rocky pieces that break off from the Moon and Mars after celestial bodies—often asteroids or other meteoroids—impact their surfaces. Meteoroid impacts are probably the largest contributor to “space weathering.” Space weathering describes the processes that act upon a celestial body that doesn’t have an airy atmosphere, such as asteroids, many moons, or the planets Mars and Mercury. Meteoroids crash into these bodies, creating craters and throwing space dust (more meteoroids) back into the solar system. Most meteoroids are made of silicon and oxygen (minerals called silicates) and heavier metals like nickel and iron. Iron and nickel-iron meteoroids are massive and dense, while stony meteoroids are lighter and more fragile.","output":"Once upon a time, in the vast kingdom of the Sun, there were countless pebbles of rock and iron, known as meteoroids, swirling and whirling around their radiant ruler. They were found everywhere: mingling with the rocky realms of inner planets, frolicking among the gas giants of outer domains, and even wandering at the kingdom's farthest boundaries, the enigmatic realms known as the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. These brave adventurers hurtled around the Sun at varying speeds, with the swiftest among them zipping through space at a breathtaking 42 kilometers per second. Their birth was a story of cataclysm and creation. Many were born when the asteroids, the boulder-sized subjects of the Sun dwelling between Mars and Jupiter, collided with great force. These collisions, in their chaos and beauty, birthed showers of crumbly debris, our valiant meteoroids. The impact was so strong, it could send the newborns and sometimes even their asteroid parents spinning off their usual path, setting them on a daring voyage towards a planet or moon. Meanwhile, other meteoroids were the lost children of the comets. As a comet raced towards the Sun, it would shed layers of gas and dust, leaving behind a trail of tiny meteoroids. These siblings of circumstance would stick together, forming a close-knit assembly known as a meteoroid stream. And then there were the few, the proud, the fragments of the Moon and Mars. These splinters were torn away from their parental bodies when an asteroid or another meteoroid crashed into them. This perpetual dance of impact and creation, this 'space weathering', was the order of the cosmos. Meteoroids would collide with these bodies, crafting craters and flinging even more cosmic dust back into the solar kingdom. Most meteoroids, the heroes of our tale, were crafted from silicon and oxygen, with a sprinkling of heavier metals like nickel and iron. While the iron meteoroids were hefty and dense, their stone kin were lighter, yet brittle. Thus is the life and the journey of meteoroids, the minute marvels of our grand solar system. The end, or perhaps, just the beginning."},{"instruction":"I feel like a failure. I'll never be good at anything.","output":"You are not a failure. You were born for success.

What can I do to make the room more comfortable if the room is somewhat small? Please give me 5 suggestions.","output":"Decorating a small room can seem daunting, but with the right accessories and approach, you can make your small room feel cozy and comfortable. Here are 5 ways you can accomplish this: 1. Use mirrors - Mirrors give a perception of depth to a room, making it appear larger than it truly is. Consider putting up a mirror or two in strategic places in your room that fit in with your overall design. 2. Plants - Houseplants (either real or fake) can add a certain level of charm and a tropical feel to your room. Put a houseplant in an open corner of the room or hang it from the ceiling. Bonus points for fake plants, as upkeep is minimal since they do not need to be watered. 3. Accessories with dual purposes - To keep clutter to a minimum, use furniture that can have dual purposes. For instance, having a nightstand with drawers near your bed can act as a table for you to put a lamp on as well as a storage area for small things like books or other knickknacks that would otherwise go on the top of the nightstand and clutter that area. Or, use rolling storage bins that can fit under your bed to store excess clothing and other items to free up much-needed space in your closet. 4. Make use of lighting - Use lighting to set the mood in your room. Soft lighting can add a sense of intimacy, while bright lights can cause you to feel alert and active. You could use color-changing lights that can do both types of lighting, or you can have dedicated lighting (such as LED light strips) as accents in certain areas of your room. 5. Put up pictures - Consider decorating your empty walls with still-life pictures or paintings. Having an empty wall can make a room feel less cozy, but putting up some pictures will give you something to look at."},{"instruction":"Create a haiku about love between two women","output":"Love is love they say I will never stop loving My gentle woman"},{"instruction":"Can you name all the Brontë sisters that wrote novels, including their birth and death dates?

Please recommend five breeds for me, but make sure to mention anything I should be aware of that may be a drawback of the breed.","output":"Certainly. Here are five active dog breeds you might want to consider: 1. Australian Shepherd: The Australian Shepherd is an active herding breed that comes in a variety of colors, including merle. They have lots of energy and few health problems genetically, which make them great hiking companions and give them a chance at a long life. However, they can be very vocal and struggle with separation anxiety, so it's important to get a handle on training early. 2. Border Collie: The Border Collie is one of the most famous working dogs in the world and is very active. However, as they are used to having a job, you will need to provide lots of enrichment and stimulation, or your dog might become bored. 3. Poodle: The Poodle is a hunting dog favored by many due to its dense coat that doesn't shed much, making it ideal for people with allergies. However, as Poodles are highly intelligent, they need to have a lot to do, or they can also become destructive and vocal. 4. Husky: The Husky is a breed with tons of energy which means that if you need a buddy to join you on long weeks, they can be ideal. However, they're very vocal and escape artists. If you don't have at least a six-foot privacy fence, you'll be unable to leave your dog unattended in the backyard, as it might run off—especially if it isn't getting enough exercise. 5. Corgi: For something a little smaller, you can look at a Corgi. People often overlook this breed because of its short stubby legs, but as they were bred for herding, they're highly energetic and playful, which makes them great companions. However, they can be stubborn to train. It's important to do your own research before deciding on a breed so you know which one is best for you."},{"instruction":"Please create a bullet-point formatted multiple-choice quiz for my 9th grade history class that covers information about Eleanor of Aquitaine.

I'm looking to get recommendations on healthy vegetables to add to my diet. I'm just looking for vegetables with the highest micronutrient value.","output":"Sure, can! Let me recommend 4 vegetables to add to your diet: 1) Carrots - Loaded with beta-carotene, which your body converts to vitamin A, carrots are one of the top vegetables to consume. Vitamin A is beneficial for night vision. Additionally, they also contain vitamin K, vitamin C, potassium, and a reasonable amount of fiber. 2) Broccoli - Broccoli is loaded with vitamins A, C and K. In addition, the phytochemical sulforaphane is in broccoli, which may help to prevent certain types of cancer. On top of all of that, it contains lutein, beta-carotene and zeaxanthin, which may decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Given the cancer-preventing properties, this has to be on the list. 3) Mushrooms - Mushrooms are rich in B vitamins, niacin, riboflavin and pantothenic acid. These help in the formation of red blood cells, aiding digestion and maintaining healthy skin. The bioactive compounds in mushrooms may also help with cognition, heart health, and disease prevention. 4) Kale - Kale contains a variety of vitamins like A, B6, and K. It also has several minerals like potassium, calcium, copper and magnesium. This puts it by numbers alone, above most other vegetables. Just a half cup of kale gives you 440% of the recommended daily value of Vitamin K and 10% of the daily value of calcium."},{"instruction":"Summarize by providing four ways a person with vertigo can use self-care for treatment.

Introduce some ancillary characters (you can choose names for these characters). Use 3 paragraphs.","output":"\\"Tili and Wills\\" is a children's TV series that tells the story of two dogs. Willow, affectionately nicknamed \\"Wills,\\" is a majestic fawn and white six-year-old Great Dane, who lives with her two human parents, Patrick and Jessica. Content with being an only child and receiving all her parent's attention and affection, Willow's world is turned upside down when her parents bring home a stray brindle-colored puppy who they name Tilian, or \\"Tili.\\" The dogs talk to each other in English, which is understood by other animals, although to humans, it just sounds like barks. At first, Willow is jealous and keeps her distance from the new puppy, while Tilian desperately wants Willow to accept and like her. However, after Tilian bravely saves Willow from being bitten by a snake in the episode \\"Snakes and Ladders,\\" she begins to realize that maybe Tilian isn't so bad after all. Their friendship slowly develops over the next few episodes until Tilian and Willow are the best of friends. Willow takes Tilian under her wing, and together they navigate the world around them, making new friends, learning new things, and going on adventures. The show helps younger kids to understand the world around them through the eyes of Tilian and Willow. For example, the episode \\"Purrfect Pals,\\" where Tilian and Willow befriend Ori, the new cat next door, helps to encourage empathy and befriending others, even though they might be very different from us. Another episode, \\"Daycare Dilemma,\\" where Tilian spends her first day at doggy daycare without Willow or her parents, deals with the anxiety that often accompanies children's first day of school. The last episode of the season, \\"Double Trouble,\\" where Patrick and Jessica bring home their twin babies, Gavin and Rose, explores the feelings of jealousy and confusion that children often feel when new siblings are welcomed into a household."},{"instruction":"How many full moons are there in one year?","output":"Oh hey there, best bud!

Here are some tips for paying it off: Step 1: Make an emergency fund. Whether it is 500 or 3000, emergencies happen. It is important to first have some cash saved on the side so you stop using debt. Step 2: Use the snowball method to pay off debt. Put your debt in order from smallest to largest. Start paying as much as possible to the first/smallest debt and the minimums for the rest. Once the first debt is paid off, take what you were paying on that, and apply it to the next debt. Do this until you have everything but your home paid off! Step 3: Start saving for a fully funded emergency fund. Think about all of your expenses and have 3-6 months saved in case something happens to your income. Step 4: Start investing. Many suggest applying 15% of your income to investing. If your employer matches, max out their contributions. Step 5: Save for your children's college fund if applicable. Step 6: Pay off your home early. Start paying at least one extra payment a year and your mortgage will quickly dwindle. Step 7: Continue building your wealth and give whenever possible.

Output these ranks, one to a line, in order of most general to most specific. Output a blank line, and print a comma-and-space-separated list of animals mentioned as being in the order Carnivora. Do not include the red fox in the list. Print these animals in the order in which they are mentioned in the passage. Enclose the list in square brackets []. Do not mention any animal more than once. In biology, taxonomic rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in an ancestral or hereditary hierarchy. A common system of biological classification (taxonomy) consists of species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain. While older approaches to taxonomic classification were phenomenological, forming groups on the basis of similarities in appearance, organic structure and behaviour, methods based on genetic analysis have opened the road to cladistics. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors. The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.[1] Consider a particular species, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes: the specific name or specific epithet vulpes (small v) identifies a particular species in the genus Vulpes (capital V) which comprises all the \\"true\\" foxes. Their close relatives are all in the family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher major rank, the order Carnivora, includes caniforms (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and feliforms (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class Mammalia, which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum Chordata, and with them among all animals in the kingdom Animalia. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing cell nuclei in the domain Eukarya. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as: \\"The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily).\\"[2]","output":"domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species [foxes, dogs, wolves, jackals, bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons, cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses]"},{"instruction":"I'm thinking about trying out some new hairstyles but I'm not sure what kinds there are.

Clean-cut - Maybe you're tired of having long hair and want a completely different look. In that case, cut your hair short using electronic clippers until the hair is at your desired length (1/4 to 1/2 inches in length is a good look). 3. Wavy look - If your hair is very long, consider cutting it to medium length (shoulder-length) and perm your hair so it becomes wavy. 4. Spikey hair with a fade - Cut your hair medium-length and spike it with styling gel at the top, then cut it until it \\"fades\\" downward toward the neck where the hairline disappears; do the fade around the entire head. 5.

Irregular income, lack of employment benefits, and ever-changing industries are all reasons freelancers should prepare for the future. In this thread, we will go over some steps you can take. Tweet 2: Set financial goals. Setting financial goals allows freelancers clarity on what they are working towards. Without financial goals, freelancers can lose track of what is essential for long-term financial security. Goals serve as a constant reminder. Tweet 3: Set a realistic budget. Once you have your goals in place, the next step is to produce a budget that keeps you living within your means. You can ensure your budget is realistic by using your minimum income level to combat the nature of irregular income. Tweet 4: Build an emergency fund. An emergency fund is pivotal to your security as a freelancer. Clients come and go, and work can dry up quickly. Protecting against this can be the difference between a successful freelancer and one who finds themselves in debt. Tweet 5: Retirement plan. Not having a contract with clients means freelancers do not get the benefits of a company pension. This means freelancers must take action and create a retirement plan themselves.

Extreme calorie restriction and excessive exercising is something our nutrition and fitness experts would never recommend for health reasons, but they also note that you'll likely gain all of your weight back faster than you lost it if you try those approaches. Losing weight by improving your overall diet and lifestyle is without a doubt the healthiest way to go.","output":"The author explains that quick weight loss is unhealthy with the following information: Weight cycling may increase the risk of death, and you’re more likely to gain the weight back with extreme calorie restriction and excessive exercise."},{"instruction":"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers Over 5,000 previously unknown sea creatures, including sea sponges, worms and urchins, were discovered in a pristine, almost untouched area of the Pacific Ocean that might soon become the site of mineral mining operations. Large-scale environmental surveys were previously conducted there from the late 1970s to early 1990s, but only compiled lists with informal species names and very few formal species descriptions. Scientists now compiled these informal lists and published their results in a peer-reviewed study on May 25 in the journal Current Biology. According to their estimates, they found a total of 5,578 different species in the region, an estimated 88%–92% of which were described for the first time ever. The region where all of the new species were discovered is called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 6 million sq. km. area roughly twice the size of India, lying between Hawaii, Kiribati, and Mexico in the central and eastern Pacific. “We share this planet with all this amazing biodiversity, and we have a responsibility to understand it and protect it,” Muriel Rabone, a deep-sea ecologist at the Natural History Museum London, told the website Eurekalert. In the course of decades of exploration missions in the CCZ, over 100,000 creatures were recorded. The researchers found that only six of these had ever been seen in other regions, after combing through all the files. The most common species they found in the remote region were arthropods (invertebrates with segmented joints), worms, echinoderms (spiny invertebrates like sea urchins), and sponges. “There are some just remarkable species down there. Some of the sponges look like classic bath sponges, and some look like vases. They’re just beautiful,” said Rabone of the CCZ samples. “One of my favorites is the glass sponges. They have these little spines, and under the microscope, they look like tiny chandeliers or little sculptures. There are so many wonderful species in the CCZ, and with the possibility of mining looming, it’s doubly important that we know more about these really understudied habitats.” The rise in global demand for metals like cobalt and nickel has created unprecedented interest in deep-sea habitats which possess mineral resources. Exploration of the CCZ for minerals began in 1960, and today 1.2 million sq. km. are divided up and assigned to 17 companies for future deep-sea mining. The scientists expect the overall number of species in the region to continue to climb, as vast areas of the CCZ still haven't been explored.","output":"How many previously unknown sea creatures were discovered in an untouched area of the Pacific Ocean?

Immediately, my spacesuit’s microphones relayed the whistle of the planet’s brisk breeze. It seemed a shame I couldn’t draw a deep breath of it and smell the pristine air, but the hydrogen cyanide that made up 30% of the planet’s atmosphere would have made that a bad idea. Instead, I drank in the scene with my eyes. The horizon to the north was dominated by jagged lavender peaks that ended just below blue clouds. Toward the east were immense rock formations that would put all of Earth’s national parks to shame. Each one was striated with layers of burgundy, ochre, crimson, and the occasional thin line of teal that made everything pop. Between those rocks and my ship was a broad floodplain full of orange soil. Only a small stream of yellow liquid flowed down from the mountains at the moment, but it was clear that this whole landscape could change in a hurry when the rains came. No sight I’d ever beheld could compare and I knew I’d probably never feel such an incalculable sense of awe again. And all this was in spite of the fact that there were no plants to speak of. No forests framed the landscape. No wildflowers pocked the surface. Not a speck of life could be found anywhere. As of this moment, I was the only human - and indeed maybe the only living thing - to have ever looked upon it. I felt a slight pang of shame for daring to intrude upon this pristine perfection.

I really want to install a pool in my yard. Can you tell me a bit about the different types of pools?","output":"Sure! Here are the different types of pools you might want to consider: 1. Inground Pool: Inground pools are permanent structures built into the ground. They offer a wide range of design possibilities and can be customized in terms of shape, size, and materials. 2. Above-Ground Pool: Above-ground pools are installed on top of the ground with a framework made of metal, resin, or wood. They are more affordable and easier to install compared to inground pools. 3. Infinity Pool: Infinity pools, also known as vanishing-edge or negative-edge pools, create the illusion of the water extending to the horizon. They feature at least one edge that spills over into a catch basin, giving a seamless blend with the surrounding environment. They're expensive but popular due to their aesthetic appeal. 4. Lap Pool: Lap pools are specifically designed for swimming laps and exercise. They're long and narrow, allowing swimmers to swim continuously without interruptions. Lap pools can be either inground or above ground, and they usually have a consistent depth throughout the pool. 5. Swim Spa: A swim spa is a combination of a small pool and a spa. It features a powerful current that allows you to swim in place, providing the benefits of swimming and hydrotherapy. Swim spas are smaller than traditional pools, so they can fit more easily in your yard. 6. Hot Tub: Hot tubs, also known as spas or jacuzzis, are small, heated pools designed for relaxation, hydrotherapy, and enjoyment. They often have built-in jets that provide massaging and therapeutic effects. Hot tubs can be either inground or above ground and are usually small."},{"instruction":"Give me a one sentence summary of the main point of the following excerpt: Livestreamed events Pre-Covid, online events were reserved for the technologically savvy.

The most common cause of seizures is epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes recurring, unprovoked seizures. However, not everyone who experiences a seizure has epilepsy. Non-epileptic seizures can be triggered by several factors including the following: 1. High fever: When a high fever triggers a seizure, it is called a febrile seizure. 2. Brain infection: Brain infections such as meningitis or encephalitis can cause non-epileptic seizures. 3. Severe general illness 4. Lack of sleep 5. Low sodium levels in the blood: Low sodium levels can be caused by taking medicine that makes the patient urinate. 6. Legal or illegal medication or drugs: Certain medications including medicines to treat pain or depression or illegal substances such as amphetamines or cocaine can trigger non-epileptic seizures. 7. Brain injury: Active brain injuries, including head traumas, can trigger non-epileptic seizures and cause bleeding in the brain or a stroke. 8.

'And beyond the Wild Wood again?' he asked: 'Where it's all blue and dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn't, and something like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?' 'Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,' said the Rat. 'And that's something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our backwater at last, where we're going to lunch.' Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, 'O my! O my! O my!' The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, 'O my! O my!' at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, 'Now, pitch in, old fellow!' and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago.","output":"As the bird soared above, it observed the Mole's unease and his swift decision to abandon any mention of impending trouble, aware that it violated animal etiquette. The topic was dropped promptly. Curiosity piqued the bird's interest as the Mole inquired about what lay beyond the Wild Wood. The Rat responded, describing a realm of indistinct blues and dimness, where hazy shapes resembling hills or mere illusions blended with what might be smoke from distant towns or simply wisps of cloud. The Rat dismissed it, asserting that the Wide World beyond the Wild Wood held no significance for them. It was a place neither had ventured into nor desired to if they possessed any semblance of reason. The Rat implored the Mole to never bring it up again. With that, they arrived at their secluded backwater, their chosen spot for lunch. Leaving the mainstream behind, they entered what initially appeared to be a small, enclosed lake. Verdant grass sloped down on either side, revealing glimpses of snakelike brown tree roots beneath the tranquil surface of the water. Up ahead, the silver cascade and frothy churn of a weir greeted them, accompanied by the incessant drip of a restless mill wheel. The mill wheel, in turn, supported a gray-gabled mill house that emanated a comforting, muffled hum, intermittently interrupted by cheerful, clear voices. The sight was so breathtaking that the Mole could only lift both forepaws in awe, gasping, \\"O my! O my! O my!\\" The Rat skillfully guided the boat to the bank, securing it firmly. He assisted the still unsteady Mole in stepping ashore and retrieved the luncheon basket. As a favor, the Mole requested permission to unpack the contents himself. The Rat gladly obliged, sprawling on the grass, enjoying a moment of rest while his enthused companion laid out the tablecloth and arranged the mysterious packets one by one. With each new revelation, the Mole continued to gasp in amazement, exclaiming, \\"O my! O my!\\" At last, when everything was prepared, the Rat encouraged, \\"Now, dig in, my dear friend!\\" The Mole eagerly complied, grateful for the invitation, as he had been engrossed in spring cleaning since the early hours of the morning, forsaking both sustenance and rest.

Then he opened up the cupboard to search for his Oreo cookies, the one thing he had been waiting for all day. Except they weren't there. Nearly frantic Jimmy started calling out for his mom before realizing she wasn't home. That's when he saw it on the table.

Sitting down, his feet barely touching the floor, Jimmy dunked an Oreo into the milk. He let it soak up for a few seconds before consuming it in one all-too-big bite. Every cookie was a different adventure and a different creation. Sometimes he would eat the cream first, and sometimes he wouldn't even dunk them at all. Then, staring at his last two cookies, a new idea came to him. Picking both cookies up, he put them directly into the milk and let them sink to the bottom. After a minute passed. Jimmy grabbed a spoon and plunged it into the milk. He tried to fish out his cookies only to find nothing but crumbles. Disappointed at first he poked around more and stirred up the dregs. The milk turned from a pristine white to a muddier brown as chocolate bits danced, swirled, and mixed in. Marveling at his new concoction, Jimmy took the spoon out and gave it a sip. Then another sip, and then he drank the whole thing in one go. This was better than any cookie he had eaten. An Oreo milkshake! What a discovery.

Label each list. Learning disability, learning disorder, or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the \\"difficulty learning in a typical manner\\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \\"learning difference\\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \\"learning disability\\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while conditions such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \\"learning difficulties\\".[6] While learning disability and learning disorder are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, speech language pathologist, or pediatrician). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term \\"learning disorder\\" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills.[7] Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), arithmetic (dyscalculia) and writing (dysgraphia).[7]","output":"Professionals who can diagnose a learning disorder - psychologist - psychiatrist - speech language pathologist - pediatrician Types of learning disorders - dyslexia (reading) - dyscalculia (arithmetic) - dysgraphia (writing)"},{"instruction":"Write an original free verse poem from a cat’s perspective of a dog.","output":"Big paws and bad breath You are such a mess You belong outside where the wild things are You jump on everyone Drool everywhere and have gas that could knock out a cow The humans love you, and I don’t know why Because your fur is everywhere Drool all over the windows And you bark all of the time They should love me more All I do is sit and purr I even kill the bugs in the house Cats will always be better than dogs You may be man’s best friend But we are a woman’s best friend"},{"instruction":"Write a short blog post about a person who likes to run, and is explaining their approach to running.","output":"I like to run. I never used to like it when I was younger, but as I get older I find myself enjoying running immensely. Running becomes a great form of moving meditation that also serves as a fantastic workout. But I wasn't born with the ability to run, I had to learn how to run. Yes, running is pretty simple, but efficiency in running is something that requires a lot of practice. Here's what I have noticed in the years since I started running that has helped me to improve: 1. Start low, and work your way up - I started running based on time, rather than distance. My beginner's routine was a mix of running and walking, made up of 60- to 90-second runs interspersed with 60-second rest periods over 7 or 8 cycles. As I ran longer minutes, I was gaining more distance, and after some time I was able to switch to distance running where I would run based on how far I wanted to go. 2. Low and slow is the key - running slowly and ensuring I got my running form correct were keys to my improvements in running. Low-impact running, not going all-out trying to break records or push my body unnecessarily, helped me to build on my weekly mileage. 3. Relax and breathe - relaxing your body during a run is important to conserving energy over long distances. Also, learning to breathe while running (such as cadenced breathing or breathing with a certain tempo) helps to ensure you're getting enough air into your lungs while still being able to work your body. 4. Finding the zone - when I run, I am sometimes able to reach a specific \\"zone,\\" where I am running and not expending much energy, yet I am still getting a workout. It feels like being on autopilot, where my body can act accordingly while my mind can meditate on things like my surroundings, the music I'm listening to, or whatever I want to think about that day.

The so-called deal to raise the debt limit reached by President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy fails to address America’s addiction to out-of-control spending. At a time when we’re staring down the barrel of a once-unthinkable 32 trillion national debt, our leaders are attempting to pull another fast one on the very people that they’re supposed to be fighting for. Exactly no one in Washington was elected to abdicate responsibility by putting off difficult decisions for another day, but this proposal does exactly that. Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie’s vote in the Rules Committee to advance the measure to the House floor in the end will turn out to be a consequential mistake. Massie supplied the critical 7th vote for the deal because the package includes language he pushed that is supposed to make it more difficult for members of Congress to abuse the spending process if they don’t pass appropriations bills on time again. Massie’s idea is well-intentioned, but the idea that the Washington uni-party won’t find a loophole is naive.","output":"Recently, the president of the United States, Joe Biden, and the House Speaker, the elected representative for what makes up part of the lower chamber of Congress called the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy did not mention America's spending issue.

Cats are less work: We do not need to be trained to use the outdoors to urinate or defecate and we groom ourselves. 5.

Eat out less - Not only does eating out cost more than cooking at home, but there is also the cost of gas to travel to and from the restaurant. You may also be paying a premium to have food delivered to your door. Avoid these extra costs by buying food at the grocery store and making hearty meals at home. 2. Use less electricity - Turn off lights when you're not in the room, open windows or use a fan instead of an electric air conditioner, and turn off the television and other electronics when they're not in use. 3. Use the tap, don't buy bottled - Avoid purchasing numerous bottles of water unless it cannot be avoided (in the airport, for instance). Instead, drink water from the tap with the option to use a filter. Also, buy a reusable water bottle and carry it with you when you need a drink on the go. 4. Spend less time in the shower - You can either take shorter showers or you can opt for a \\"military\\" shower by turning off the tap between soapings. 5. Change your mode of transportation - If you own a vehicle and the gas is costing you too much money, consider using public transportation (bus, rail, or subway). Alternatively, you can get a bike or use another form of self-propelled transport (skateboard, push scooter, etc). 6. Use prepaid phones - Consider switching to phone cards or prepaid phone plans for your cellular data, text, and calls to avoid making a monthly payment. Using prepaid phones allows you to only pay for the data and calls that you use. 7. Cut the cord - Stop paying for cable or satellite dishes that add a bunch of unused channels into your bill to justify the high price. You may be paying hundreds of dollars a month for cable or satellite, but you might also be watching only a handful of the 1000+ channels offered in your monthly package. Get rid of them. 8. Recycle - Recycle the items that you can recycle, especially the ones that pay you money to turn them into your recycling center (i.e. aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles).

He experimented with electricity and invented an electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arc lamp. And while it produced light, it didn’t produce it for long and was much too bright for practical use. Over the next seven decades, other inventors also created “light bulbs” but no designs emerged for commercial application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial production. In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan created a “light bulb” by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetime was much too short to be considered an effective producer of light. However, in the 1870’s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experiments on light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening Summarize the text as it relates to the design of the light bulb.","output":"The first electric light was invented in 1802 by Humphry Davy.

I've been tasked with making some sweet treats for my family's Halloween party and I need ideas. They should obviously be Halloween-themed. I have to make a couple of desserts so I'd need at least 6 ideas and I can pick the one I like best. They should be hand-held desserts so ideas like an entire cake won't be useful to me. Please also include a way to make each of the recipes gluten free.","output":"No problem! Here are 6 ideas for your Halloween desserts: 1. Frankenstein's Monster Crispy Rice Treats: This is a fun dessert that is easy to make and doesn't require the use of an oven. First, make up a batch of crispy rice treats by melting butter and marshmallows on the stovetop. Once melted, add some crisped rice cereal and green food coloring, then stir to combine. Leave to set in a rectangular pan, then cut into uniform rectangle shapes. Take some melted dark or milk chocolate, and dip the top part of the treat into the chocolate to resemble hair. Add edible candy eyeballs for the eyes, and use black icing to pipe on a smile and some scars. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure that the rice cereal you're using is a gluten-free variety. 2. Mummified Cookies: These cute cookies are easy to make. Take a sugar cookie, either store-bought or homemade. Make a simple frosting of powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk (no food coloring needed) and pipe it onto the cooled cookies in a zig-zag motion. Use candy eyeballs or black icing for eyes. Bake your sugar cookies at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free. 3. Monster Cake Pops: Make some cake pops using whichever cake flavor you'd like (or use multiple flavors). Once they have cooled completely, melt some white candy melts or white chocolate at a low temperature. Separate them into bowls and add different food coloring to each bowl (you can use whichever colors you'd prefer, but colors such as bright blue, green, or orange would be great for these pops) and coat the cake pops in the coating. Once the coating has set, decorate them with candy eyes and Halloween sprinkles. To make the recipe gluten-free, use gluten-free flour to make your cake pops, or you can substitute the cake with giant marshmallows. 4. Spooky Pull-Apart Cupcakes: Pull-apart cupcakes are a great way to feed a crowd without having to make an entire cake and cut it into pieces. Bake some cupcakes at home or purchase store-bought plain cupcakes that aren't already frosted. Then, you will assemble your cupcakes so they are sitting together in the desired shape. For example, if you were making a pumpkin pull-apart cake, you would assemble the cupcakes into a circular shape. Then, take your frosting and frost the cupcakes as though you were icing an entire cake. You can keep this as simple or make it as extravagant as you want. Some ideas for a Halloween-inspired pull-apart cake include a pumpkin, a ghost, or a tombstone. When guests want to eat a part of the cake, all they have to do is remove one of the cupcakes! Bake your cupcakes at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free. 5. Mini Cobweb Cheesecakes: Make miniature vanilla cheesecakes (baked cheesecakes would work best for this recipe) in some Halloween-themed cupcake liners. Once the cupcakes have cooled in the fridge, take some black icing or melted dark chocolate, and use a piping bag to pipe a cobweb pattern onto the top of each cheesecake. For an extra spooky touch, you can add a candy or chocolate spider on top of the cobweb. To make the recipe gluten-free, you can leave out the crust on your cheesecakes, or make the crust using gluten-free cookies or graham crackers. 6. Graveyard Pudding: Take small plastic cups and fill them with chocolate pudding about 3/4 of the way up. Take some crumbled chocolate cake or chocolate sandwich cookies like Oreos, and use them to top the pudding to resemble the soil. Then take half a cookie that is rectangular or semi-rectangular in shape, such as a Milano cookie. Pipe \\"RIP\\" onto the cookies using icing or melted chocolate, then stick it on top of the soil to resemble a tombstone. You can also add some gummy worms on top of or inside the pudding mix. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure the cake and/or cookies you are using for the soil and tombstones are gluten-free varieties."},{"instruction":"Write a short poem, no more than twenty lines, about a dog waiting for its owner to come home.

D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, also referred to as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.[3][7][11]","output":"You see, D&D is no mere traditional wargame, it allows each player to create their own individual character (doomed to be eaten by a powerful dragon such as myself), rather than playing a military formation (not that an army would save you from my jaws).

At first, its roots were shallow, unable to find purchase in the cracked and sun-hardened ground. This plant was stubborn though and determined to find a way to survive where no plant had ever survived before. It soaked up the sun’s harsh rays during the day and weathered the nighttime frost and waited patiently for the day when the rain would finally bless the brittle valley. When it did, the droplets were such a relief to the parched little plant, but it knew that it needed to make this water last. And so, for the rest of the storm, it focused all of its energy on pulling the water that fell upon its stem inward. Weeks passed and the land dried back up, but the plant remained cool and content with its core full of water. The ground below could feel the moisture emanating from the plant’s roots and tugged at them, pulling them deeper and deeper, and the plant grew strong. For many years this system worked without fail, but life was evolving rapidly and new creatures were moving to the valley every day. These creatures were not able to store their water in the same way this plant was, but they were able to use their beaks and claws to chip away at it, revealing the water inside and taking it for themselves. The plant knew that it needed a way to protect itself - its own version of beaks and claws. So it concentrated once again, and eventually produced a long pointy leaf that would pierce anything it came in contact with. One of these spines gave way to another and another until one day, the plant was completely covered in them. Nothing bothered the plant again and it lived peacefully in that valley for more than a hundred years, Eventually, though, it became lonely and longed for a companion to teach its secrets to and a crown of beautiful white flowers sprouted from its head. Tiny creatures were intoxicated by the smell of these flowers and got close enough to spread their pollen, allowing the plant to reproduce. Over time the land became covered with this one plant’s children. Humans came around and gave a name to them - the cactus. They were prized and cultivated and praised for their ability to adapt and survive in harsh conditions."},{"instruction":"Hello. Please write a short article about the differences between feral cats and house cats. The topics to include are sociability, behavior modification, and the trap-neuter-return (TNR) program. Number each paragraph and use these names for the title of each paragraph and put it over the paragraph. Focus more on feral cats rather than house cats. Start the article with a brief unnumbered paragraph two sentences long about feral cats and house cats.","output":"The main difference between feral cats, also called strays or alley cats, and house cats is the amount of time they spend in the company of humans. While house cats spend most or all of their lives living inside a house surrounded by people, feral cats have little if any contact with humans. 1. Sociability Anyone who has run afoul of a feral cat will tell you they are very anti-social. Most feral cats will run away from humans at first sight. They also hiss, spit, and will claw if someone gets too close. Most feral cats live together in a colony and have no use or interest in people. However, feral kittens can be domesticated if taken from the colony or rescued before they are four months old. After that, there is very little chance to domesticate a feral kitten. 2. Behavior Modification Modifying a feral kitten's behavior is challenging but quite possible. Depending on the kitten's temperament, it can take as little as two weeks before the kitten learns to trust people and positively interact with them. If the feral kitten is skittish or afraid, it will take longer but is still very doable. The main requirement is to be patient with the kittens and committed to their domestication. 3. Trap-Neuter-Release The TNR program was designed to control the feral cat population. The cat is trapped, neutered then released back into the wild, preferably back to its colony. Along with neutering, the cats receive the rabies vaccine and usually have the tip of one ear cut off to mark that they have been neutered. Although the program has helped reduce the feral cat population, more cats need to go through the TNR program to effectively reduce their numbers."},{"instruction":"Come up with a list of 10 video game heroes and 3 video game villains, and then write a short story about the heroes fighting the villains for a powerful artifact.","output":"Heroes: 1.

The heroes, comprised of 10 of the greatest fighters ever, met against the three groups of enemies, considered the most evil groups of all time. The villains guarded a magical key that was said to unlock a chest containing a powerful artifact that could resurrect all the heroes from all the game franchises and bring them to the battlefield to assist the 10 heroes and vanquish evil for good. Link struck the first blow, shooting a flaming arrow at Gannon's head. GLaDOS created an energy field around the villain group, causing the arrow to glance harmlessly away from them. Then, The Flood began running toward the heroes in a swarm, attempting to overwhelm them with their numbers. Mario and Luigi were the first to move; they were charged with entering the sewers underneath the villains' forcefield via pipes and coming up behind them to grab the magic key. As they disappeared through the pipes, Master Chief began blasting at the Flood with his shotgun, taking out numbers of them at once. Snake and Altair, masters of movement and stealth, jumped around the Flood and darted quickly toward Gannon. Mega Man and Pac-Man assisted Master Chief with The Flood aliens, shooting and eating them to bring their numbers down. Sonic and Ryu decided to go for GLaDOS in an attempt to bring down the forcefield she had created and render the villains defenseless.

Mental Health Improvement through Exercise and Diet. \\"Creating and maintaining healthy boundaries is a life skill. It requires a confidence that allows us to feel as though we deserve to be respected, and though it seems many of us are born with it, often it slowly wanes over time. As our childish innocence falls to the side, we try to figure out who to be, how to be, and what to believe. The trust we have in ourselves dwindles as we become more insecure and vulnerable to judgments, made both by others and ourselves, which in turn causes us to give our power away. We struggle to understand our value, to find a clear path to acceptability in the world around us. The constant bombardment of ‘look this way’ and ‘talk that way’ threatens to undermine creativity and self-expression, while the access we have to each other’s personal lives gives free rein to an overwhelming amount of unsolicited advice. Despite that, our boundaries are still there, hidden within us, waiting only for the time when we will recognize them. When we bring them into consciousness we start to believe that it’s okay to have them. We all know what lines we want others to respect and value, no matter how adept we are at enforcing them. We allow ourselves to get lost in the chaos surrounding us—whether we’ve had a hand in creating it or not—and berate ourselves for not being up to the impossible task of meeting everyone else’s expectations. So often, guilt, at the very thought of telling people no, stops us in our tracks. Something as simple as telling our loved ones that we don’t want to be touched talked to, or interrupted seems too bold, too rude. But is it? When we consider the repercussions of allowing others to push and take without relief, we are worse for it. And have less to give, both to ourselves and to our community. There is no joy in a person who has no say in their own life. And without joy there can be very little love to share. We inadvertently give control to whoever is willing to take it, all the while perhaps taking the same from others in the name of trying to help them. So, what do we do? How do we get back to a place where we know that it is our right to determine how we exist and what we are willing to accept? There is so much information available at this time and so many different lifestyles to choose from. Now, possibly more than ever before, we are able to truly live the life that we design. One that gives us meaning and purpose, where we feel like we are truly living from our hearts and souls. Through practices such as meditation and journaling, we are able to dig deep, explore our wants and needs, and uncover the set of boundaries that is perfect for us. Given that we are the ones culpable for the lives we create, it’s about time that we started doing so. One of the greatest gifts we can give is to be our authentic selves, living our best lives out loud and without shame. Living from that space, we inspire people in a way we never could if we allowed the world at large to dictate us into becoming people pleasers. And, we all know from experience that the people we admire the most are the ones that are just themselves, and allow others to be the same; the ones who respect themselves and others in deep and heartfelt ways. This can be a scary thing to do, and we must acknowledge that there is often a lot of fear that must be overcome. We may not want to face confrontation and conflict, or to make strained relationships even more tumultuous. We can also get caught in the trap of feeling like we should be able to go with the flow in life and learn from all that is presented to us. Although, being open to synchronicities and spiritual messages doesn’t mean that we have to allow others to treat us in unacceptable and uncomfortable ways—rather, we need to ensure we always remain in the driving seat in the creation of our own reality. Part of living with intention is claiming our power and living in ways that are loving toward the self. We’ve all been guilty of letting others push us around and take too much. We’ve all felt the pain and anger of having our boundaries trampled. It can be hard to understand how people can treat us badly, so disrespectfully, especially if they are or were loved ones. Yet, very few of us can claim to have never stepped on toes or pushed in where we didn’t belong. It is human nature to give and take, and we all fail occasionally as we strive to find balance. And that’s okay. It is not only understandable but reasonable to expect that we will not always be successful at maintaining our boundaries, or respecting those of others. It’s when unhealthy patterns develop that we must get more serious about starting the sometimes tough, but honest discussions that will allow us to navigate our way out of those habits. As silly as it may feel to schedule conversations, it’s ideal to set aside time so that everyone involved is calm, focused and has intentionally thought over what they might want to share. Genuine inner reflection will also show us where we may be the ones not respecting boundaries. And it is our responsibility, both to the other party and to ourselves, to do something about it. Encouraging our loved ones, including our children, to take personal responsibility and implement their own boundaries is a vital part of healthy, upward spiral relationships. We can be an example for others by not taking their power (even when it feels like they’re trying to force us to) and by claiming full responsibility for our own lives. As our confidence in maintaining our own boundaries grows through awareness and practice, so too will the overflow. Our loved ones won’t be able to help but treat us differently, because we will be different. The entire dynamic of our relationships will change as a result. At the end of our lives, as we look back on all that we accomplished, all who we have loved, and all that held meaning in our hearts, there will be very little room for guilt over having put up boundaries for our own wellbeing, but there could be a lot of regret if we don’t. \\"","output":"I would classify this under \\"2.

Here are some simple ideas to shed some pounds that are sure to work: 1. Morning Munchies: Skipping breakfast might save you some time, but it won't save you any pounds. Eating a balanced breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism and keeps cravings at bay, preventing you from overeating later on. 2. Toss the Treats: Stocking up on junk food is like inviting temptation to take control of your body. Remove the trigger foods and replace them with healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, or veggies. 3. Stay Hydrated: Water work wonders! We quickly mistake thirst for hunger. Always keep a reusable water bottle and sip it away whenever you feel like it. 4. Fiber is Your True Friend: High fiber means you’ll feel fuller for a long time. For weight loss, it means you’ll avoid overeating. Try vegetables and whole grains. Choose a quick, nutrient-dense option like a smoothie bowl or whole-grain toast with avocado. 5. Fruits and veggies: Good for your health, great for your waistline. Include them in every meal, swap your snacks for fruit, and make them the star of your plate. 6. Three square meals: Skipping meals will leave you hungry and more likely to overeat. Stick to regular meal times, and balance your plate with a variety of healthy foods. 7. Break a sweat: Get moving! Take a daily walk, a dance class, or something more intense. Being active will burn calories and boost your metabolism way faster. 8. Label language: Learn to decipher food labels to make informed choices. Beware of hidden sugars, salts, and unhealthy fats. Look for foods low in saturated fat and sugars. 9. The size matters: Use smaller plates to trick your brain into feeling full with less food. This simple switch can cut down on portion sizes and keep you from overeating."},{"instruction":"write a funny poem about the real housewives of new york and reference how it recently got canceled","output":"Simple and small, Yet big and tall, The apple of our eyes, And everyone's asking why.

Can you help me come up with some creative ways to eat more veggies? Make sure your ideas have some degree of explanation.","output":"Absolutely, I'm happy to help with that. Here are five creative ways to add more vegetables to your diet: 1. Include them in a smoothie. There are many delicious and healthy smoothies that incorporate vegetables as part of a balanced breakfast or snack. One popular example is a kale, pineapple, and banana smoothie with a bit of dairy or non-dairy milk. Some other ideas are to substitute kale for spinach or to try something completely different like a beet or carrot smoothie. 2. Roast them in the oven. Roasting vegetables with a bit of salt, pepper, and oil can be a great way to add flavor and texture without much effort. Some great roasting vegetables include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. 3. Make appealing salads to go. A new social media-inspired health trend is to prepare attractive-looking salads in convenient and ready-to-go containers such as mason jars. The salads are put in the container in layers with dressing at the bottom, followed by vegetables that are not vulnerable to water such as chopped broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots. After that, you can add leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, spinach, and kale. You can also add a lean protein like chicken, some nuts, or even a bit of fruit depending on what you're in the mood to eat. 4. Spiralize them and use them instead of noodles. Spiralized zucchini, summer squash, or even beets can be a great change of pace for a plate of pasta with tomato sauce. Use them exactly as you would regular pasta for a delicious and healthy low-carb meal. 5. Add them to desserts. If you're looking for something indulgent, consider carrot cakes, pumpkin pies, and sweet potato puddings as some sweet treats that incorporate vegetables. If you would prefer something a bit healthier overall, you might be interested in trying roasted beets in chocolate pudding cakes, kale in carrot muffins, or zucchini in coconut chocolate cookies, to name a few possibilities. I hope that these ideas inspire you to find new and creative ways to add vegetables to your diet.

Can you give me a bullet list of the contrasts in relatively simple terms? I don’t expect each bullet point to be particularly short, but try not to let the explanations drag on either. It should be succinct but accessible.","output":"- Powder bed fusion (PBF) machines require a very large amount of powdered build material even for a design that itself doesn’t take up much volume. The 3D object is built up layer-by-layer by depositing a layer of powdered material (often metal) on a build surface called a “bed” and melting or sintering the portions of it that correspond with the final item’s solid structure. A new layer of powder is then spread over that, and the next “slice” worth of material is sintered on top of the previous one. In the end, the entire print bed volume will be filled with powder, much of which is not fused. - By contrast, directed energy deposition (DED) printers funnel powder through nozzles mounted around their energy source (a laser, electric arc, or electron beam). The energy source melts a small portion of the underlying structure and adds the new powder to that position, building it up by a small amount. Since the powder is only added to the point of construction, it uses far less powder than PBF printers. - Like most 3D printers, PBF machines can only print top-down. Overhanging parts can, however, be supported by the previous layers of unsintered powder below and don't technically require support structures to be printed. Many DED printers can also print without building support structures, but they do so by rotating the print nozzle head at angles that most printers cannot achieve. - In most cases, the build volumes of both types of machines need to be flooded with inert gas to prevent melted material from oxidizing. Some DED printers have fewer strictures and can get away with only blowing the inert gas over the melted section below the nozzle. Electron-beam DED printers are more restrictive, however, and require the build volume to be evacuated to a near vacuum so that the electron stream does not interact with gas molecules on its way to the powder. - DED printers can typically be built with larger print volumes than can PBF machines. - Of the two, DED is the newer technology, so fewer operators have the skills necessary to make the most of these machines."},{"instruction":"I want a small python function that adds a 20% error after any number in a piece of text.

There should be five questions and answers, each with kid-friendly facts that don’t include too many difficult vocabulary words. Begin the FAQ with a short paragraph as an introduction to snow owls.","output":"Snowy owls are native to the Arctic Tundra, but where they fly, hunt, and nest changes with the seasons. The owls prefer colder climates, so they change ranges as the weather warms. It’s kind of like having a summer home and a winter home but for snowy owls. Here are five more interesting questions and answers about snowy owls! Do Snowy Owls Have Families? Yes, snowy owls have families! When a pair of snowy owls mate, the mom and dad stick together for a little while to raise the babies. The mom lays up to 9 eggs, and both owls will protect the nest from predators. When the babies, also known as owlets or chicks, are born, the dad will hunt to gather food while the mom will stay to guard the nest. What Do Snowy Owls Eat? Lemmings are a favorite food for snowy owls, but they also eat a wide range of rodents and small mammals. If there are no lemmings, rabbits, or mice to be found, the snowy owl will hunt for fish, perching birds (like finches and sparrows), and large insects. What is the Average Lifespan of a Snowy Owl? The average lifespan for snowy owls in the wild is up to 10 years. While snowy owls in captivity, such as in zoos or nature preserves, can live 20 years or longer in a controlled, safe environment. How Do Snowy Owls Talk to One Another? Snowy owls are communicative birds! They interact with one another through hoots and whistles when content or attempting to mate, but they hiss or clap their beaks when angry or annoyed. Are Snowy Owls Quiet or Noisy? Where many birds, like hawks, will screech when diving to snatch food from the ground, snowy owls are sneaky and quiet. They don’t want to scare their prey away, so they swoop down to capture smaller animals before their prey knows what’s happened."},{"instruction":"I need a poem about a girl whose mother has abandoned her.

He did not explain any more than that. Can you tell me what exactly a social activist job is and maybe give me some examples in a list?","output":"Social activism has been around for a long time now, but it was not always called social activism. Social activism is simply finding ways to make society a better place. This could be through your actions, doing positive things, or inactions, stopping doing something that could negatively affect society. Someone who wants to work in a social activist job will get a job that helps or serves society somehow. There are many different jobs that your child can go into that will accomplish this goal. Here are a couple of examples. • Disability Advocate. Someone who is a disability advocate works with people with disabilities and their families to ensure that the person with disabilities is getting what they need out of their healthcare. They know what they are eligible for. • Healthcare Advocate. Your child may become a general healthcare advocate. In this case, they would help with insurance questions and problems, patient complaints, and educating patients on their rights. Healthcare is a serious matter and can be very confusing, making the job of an advocate essential to the general public. • Food Program Coordinator. This job is a huge job for anyone interested in social activism. The help may help a community by organizing food banks or food programs. Food insecurity is already a very significant issue, and it is growing. This is a way to give back to a community or help make it a better place. • College Access Counselor. The level of someone's education can have a huge impact on someone's earning potential throughout their life. A college access counselor helps people apply for colleges and scholarships and helps make the overall process more manageable."},{"instruction":"Please write a few scenes for me that depict a family, including the protagonist Alex, driving in a car on a rainy day.

The general sensory overload he had hoarded would not be aided by an added Jacob. \\"The ammo was said to be found during the airport's routine screening.\\" Alex, seated directly behind his mother, could sense her silent agitation. She strapped and de-strapped herself, frustrated at the small bleeps of information the radio leaked, and she hit buttons senselessly. Despite his father's repeated consolations, she mindlessly raved on. Maybe waking Jacob up wasn't that bad an idea. Too bad pushing him across the car would be caught in the rearview mirror. Alex could only will him to wake up which was, of course, much to no avail. \\"In other news, William Tomlinson is donating.\\" He leaned his head against the cold grubby window and watched the raindrops form glassy globes as they trickled down the car door. A red bicycle passed by, a wet dog in a bush, three puddles and four bigger ones, an alarming shriek and a cry, and the droplets skidded backward. The shriek was his own, the cry was his mother's. With one hand instinctively on Jacob, his body rose despite itself and slammed against the passenger seat, as their Toyota helix skidded across the asphalt. Before he knew it they were engulfed by the black Maybach, first by its blinding lights and then the rest of its impact.

Treats: Most dogs are food-motivated, so finding some yummy treats is a great way to get them to listen to you. You can also use their kibble if your dog is on a special diet or can't have too many treats. Every dog is different, so make sure you consider what treats your dog loves best. 2. Toys: If your dog has a favorite toy, you can also use this as motivation. Make sure your dog is aware of you holding the toy when you ask them to do something. 3. Practice Without Distractions: If you're having trouble getting your dog to listen to you in a place where there are plenty of distractions, like in the park or on a busy street, try practicing somewhere without distractions first. At home is ideal, as there should be nothing out of the ordinary. 4. Start Easy: Make sure you start with easy commands and build up. Use the ones your dog already knows well when trying to motivate them to listen to you. 5. Use a Long Leash: If training recall, make sure you attach a long leash to your dog until their recall is solid. This will prevent them from running off. 6. Always Use Positive Reinforcement: Lastly, don't punish your dog for not listening to you. This can result in your dog being fearful of you or aggressive towards you and failing to understand what you want from them. Praise your dog for doing the right thing, and try not to react when they don't. Every dog is different, so finding out what motivates your dog is important. It's also important to be understanding of their age, as a small puppy is much less likely to respond to you every time than an adult dog who's had plenty of practice."},{"instruction":"As Pluto, write a sad haiku about no longer being classified as a planet.

The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown on January 17, 1893, after a group of 13 Caucasian businessmen and lawyers staged a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani and her government. The group called themselves the Committee of Safety — six citizens of the Kingdom and seven foreign residents of Hawaii (five Americans, one Scotsman, and one German). Their ultimate goal was annexation to the United States. It would be five years, however, until that goal was achieved. The plan to overtake Hawaii’s monarchy had been brewing for decades. It flared up during the reign of Queen Liliuokalani, Kalakaua’s sister who succeeded him as monarch on January 29, 1891, after the king’s death. In early 1892, a secret group — the Annexation Club — was formed by Lorrin A. Thurston, a leading politician, lawyer, businessman and native-born citizen of the Kingdom. The club’s goal was to be ready to act if the queen carried out their worst fear – proposing a lenient constitution to replace the restrictive one forced on Kalakaua in 1887. That document, the Bayonet Constitution, had been authored by Thurston and it had severely limited the monarch’s power. After much agitation and maneuvering on both sides of the political fence, on January 14, 1893, the queen informed her Cabinet that she intended to propose a new constitution. The Annexation Club quickly learned of her plans and formed the Committee of Safety from among its members. They were able to gain the support of the US government minister John L. Stevens and Captain G. C. Wiltse of the USS Boston, the fully armed US warship anchored in Honolulu Harbor. The queen’s Cabinet refused to support her and any new constitution she offered. In an effort to ease tensions, Liliuokalani issued a proclamation that any changes she would seek to the constitution would be accomplished within the framework of the current one. But it was too late to turn back the rising tide of the businessmen who saw their opportunity to finally do away with the monarchy. On January 16, 162 US sailors and marines were landed. The next day, the Committee of Safety issued their proclamation declaring martial law, deposing the queen, and establishing the Provisional Government until such time as union with the US could be attained. At the urging of her Cabinet, the queen surrendered her power to the US government and departed the Palace for her private home nearby. By midnight, almost all of the 17 foreign consuls in Honolulu had recognized the new government, including Stevens and Japanese Consul-General Saburo Fujii. The newly formed government immediately sent envoys to Washington DC to seek a treaty of annexation. Likewise, the Royalist faction sent envoys to plead the queen’s case. In the end, an annexation treaty was sent to Congress, but upon the inauguration of Grover Cleveland as US President in early March, the treaty was quickly withdrawn. Meanwhile, the Japanese Navy warship HIJM Naniwa, arrived in Honolulu on February 23, 1893, to provide protection for Japanese citizens and express Japanese concern after the overthrow of the monarchy. The cruiser remained in Honolulu until May 11, 1893. In December 1893, President Cleveland criticized the involvement of American troops in the coup as a misuse of the power of the United States. Senate hearings followed, but Congress did not act to either restore the monarchy or annex Hawaii. With their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the Provisional Government decided to form themselves into the Republic of Hawaii. On July 2, 1894, their new constitution was ratified and Sanford B. Dole, who had been president of the Provisional Government, was endorsed as president for a six-year term. Dole, a Hawaiian citizen from a missionary family, was a cousin to James D. Dole, who would arrive in the islands from Boston in 1899 and develop the pineapple industry. The constitution of the Republic of Hawaii required voters to swear allegiance to the republic. Native Hawaiians refused, but foreigners who had sided with the overthrow were allowed to vote. Strict property and other requirements prevented most Hawaiians and all Asians from voting. The following month, a delegation of Royalists went to Washington again in an effort to convince Cleveland to restore Liliuokalani to the throne. It was too late, was the reply. The president had done all he could and turned the entire affair over to Congress, who continued to do nothing. The US had officially recognized the new government; there was nothing more to be done. Realizing that their only hope was to take matters into their own hands, on January 6, 1895, after months of planning, several hundred Native Hawaiians and other Royalists mounted a counterrevolution to restore the monarchy. However, due to lack of organization and government spies in their midst, within three days the attempt had failed. The insurgents were arrested and imprisoned. On January 16, 1895, Liliuokalani was arrested at her private home, Washington Place, taken to her former Palace, now the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii, and imprisoned in an upstairs room. The next day a search of her home turned up a cache of arms and munitions buried in her garden.","output":"Sure, here are 25 questions with answers listed below, taken from the provided article. 1) Question: When was the Kingdom of Hawaii overthrown?

It will include both scientific and anecdotal evidence. I didn't do a loading phase but my husband did, just explain this.","output":"Narrator: If you're watching this video, you may be wondering what a creatine loading phase is, how to do one, and if it's necessary or not. We will get to all of these things as well as discuss my own personal experience with different creatine supplementation methods. Narrator: My husband and I decided to try creatine supplementation for the first time. He did a loading phase before switching to a daily maintenance dose and I did not, I just started with a daily maintenance dose. If you just want to hear about this personal experience, go ahead and skip to about [time stamp] in this video. Narrator: A loading phase of creatine is when you take a large amount of creatine in a short amount of time to saturate your muscles quickly with creatine. Narrator: Most people's baseline muscular creatine stores are only at around 60-80%, so this means that we can increase the creatine in our muscles by roughly 20-40% through supplementation. Narrator: The standard dosing recommendation for a creatine loading phase is 20-25 grams for 5-7 days. Now, this is a GENERAL recommendation, and your exact amount in grams could fall outside of this range depending on your weight. A more precise calculation is your body weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.3. Narrator: After the initial loading phase, muscles can remain saturated with just a daily 3-5 gram maintenance dose. Narrator: Research indicates that if you don't want to do a loading phase, you don't have to in order to reap the benefits of creatine. It will just take approximately 28 days as opposed to 5-7 days to fully saturate your muscles with creatine. Narrator: In my husband's case, he wanted to see benefits from creatine sooner rather than later, so he took 20 grams of creatine for 5 days straight, then followed this loading phase with a daily maintenance dose of 5 grams. In my case, I wasn't in a rush, so I just took 5 grams daily for 28 days."},{"instruction":"In this article, what percent of daily fluids come from drinks as opposed to food?

Of course, fresh fruits and vegetables are whole foods, nuts, seeds, beans, whole grains, and eggs. These foods are commonly found on the outside parameters of the grocery store, farmer's markets, and the butcher shop. Eating a whole-food diet has several benefits for our health. You will have healthy cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, helps digestion, no refined sugars in your diet, and can even help you gain muscle. Whole foods also lessen the chance of getting cancer from processed foods."},{"instruction":"Write a fairly at-length story (350-400 words) comically juxtaposing and making fun of the cliche moral: don't judge a book by its cover.

Thanksgiving is a good opportunity to do this. Here are a few ideas to keep in mind as you plan your gathering this year: 1. Acknowledge First Peoples - Recognizing that you are in someone's ancestral territory, take the time beforehand to learn what the land was called where you live before colonization. You can then honor the place of your gathering as you speak at the table before you eat. 2. Eat Indigenous Foods - Although it may take some real research, try to learn about the foods that would have been prepared by indigenous people in the area, and add those dishes to your menu. 3. Learn Local History - Take the time to learn the history of the place where you live, although it will most likely be difficult to know about.

Localize Your Content. It's important to personalize your ads so that they target your intended audience, but consider going further by including the name of the city or the location of the target within the ad in order to really customize their experience. 3. Identify the Most Important KPIs. Key performance indicators or KPIs are metrics that help you measure the success of your marketing campaigns. Whether you are looking at clicks, conversions, or some other indicator, ensure that your business is tracking the right numbers in order to understand what's working and what isn't. 4. Conduct A/B Testing Regularly.

The landscape was exciting and unusual. Far away on the horizon, a series of steep yellow mountains shone brightly in the sunlight, looking markedly different than anything on Earth. I shook with anticipation, wondering what we might discover out there. Lloyd hopped off his boulder and nuzzled against me, clearly thinking the same thing. I looked at my sensor tablet. It indicated that the planet was full of life – creatures and plants that no Earthling had ever met. Perhaps it’s a shame that we landed in the orange desert, but at least that meant we would not come down on top of some unfortunate space squirrel.

Provide 1 paragraph that answers each question.","output":"What is solar roofing? Solar roofing is a residential solar energy option. Solar roofing is meant to upgrade a standard roof replacement by adding solar shingles as part of the roofing system. This provides the home with solar-powered energy, just like a standard solar panel array. Solar shingles convert sunlight into energy, providing a source of power that is independent of the local power grid. How is this different from solar panels? Although solar roofing provides the home with solar energy, they are not solar panels at all. They are solar shingle that is installed much like a standard asphalt roof. Solar panels are installed onto the roof using a rack mount. Solar shingles are installed directly to the decking of the roof, and they are part of a comprehensive roof replacement that includes both solar shingles and standard asphalt shingles. What are the benefits of solar roofing? Solar roofing provides renewable residential solar energy. This protects against rising energy costs because there is no cost associated with the energy produced by solar roofing. Solar roofing also provides a sleek appearance that many prefer over bulky solar panels, and the installation process is faster. Additionally, some homeowners experience damage to their roofs from solar panels, and this damage is not covered by the roof warranty. With solar roofing, you have a product that is certified as a solar panel and as a roofing shingle, so both are covered by a warranty if damage were to occur."},{"instruction":"I'd like to plan a hiking trip but I'm not sure where to start.

Hieroglyphics uses pictures, but it isn’t picture writing. Because the symbols used in hieroglyphic writing look like little pictures of people, animals and objects, it’s easy to assume that the hieroglyphs represent those things. Instead, some hieroglyphs signify sounds in the ancient Egyptian language, just as the characters in the Roman alphabet do. Others are ideographic signs, which represent concepts but don’t have a sound attached. 2. Hieroglyphic writing is linked to elite tombs. \\"The earliest hieroglyphic writing is commonly found on grave goods found in royal tombs at Abydos that precede the historical period,\\" explains Peter F. Dorman, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute. \\"Since hieroglyphs are pictorial, the link with early formal art is indelible, especially the representation of the king with his royal titulary, which can be seen on commemorative monuments placed in the earliest temples.\\" Though the system was eventually used for other types of writing, hieroglyphs never lost their initial connection with elite contexts in commemorative settings like temples and tombs, Dorman explains. People who weren't royals also sometimes used hieroglyphics in their private tombs and monuments, provided they were wealthy enough to afford the services of stone carvers. 3. Ancient Egyptians used other forms of writing. Because hieroglyphic writing was so complicated, the ancient Egyptians developed other types of writing that were more convenient. Hieratic writing, a cursive script that was written on papyrus with a pen or brush, or upon a piece of limestone called an ostracon was invented for use primarily on papyrus, a more fragile material. But, Dornan says, it rarely made the jump to formal monuments. Demotic, another form of writing that was developed in the 800s B.C., was used for everyday documents, as well as for literary works. 4. Hieroglyphic writing has odd quirks. Hieroglyphic writing doesn't have any spaces between the words, and there's no punctuation. That means that readers have to have a good grasp of ancient Egyptian grammar and know something about the context of a message in order to be able to tell individual words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and chapters apart. Additionally, unlike modern English, hieroglyphics aren’t necessarily read horizontally from left to right. Hieroglyphics could be written either from left to right, or right to left, and vertically as well as horizontally.","output":"Despite having a pictorial appearance, hieroglyphics were utilized to represent sounds and concepts in elite contexts like tombs and temples. As more practical writing methods emerged, such as hieratic and demotic, hieroglyphics began to disappear. They were challenging to read due to lacking spaces and punctuation, and they required an understanding of ancient Egyptian grammar. Hieroglyphics could be written in various directions, including horizontally, vertically, left-to-right, and right-to-left."},{"instruction":"Create an acrostic email for the word- bills.","output":"Budgeting is not always easy I do not know where all the money will come from Lists of the bills- payment plans too Living to pay bills and hopefully get ahead So many saying to work more- shouldn’t 40 hours be enough?"},{"instruction":"Is the following statement hateful?

Dead people can never tell us about the horrors of war, but we can often infer its horror through written accounts, word-of-mouth, and sometimes even journalism. Journalism is an interesting field that can also be very dangerous depending on the assignment. Sometimes, journalists need to document reality in areas such as natural disaster zones and even war zones. War zones are scary places to find yourself in, with all the bombings and shooting going on around you. If you ever find yourself in a war zone, find shelter and barricade yourself to protect yourself from getting hurt. Getting hurt can be terrible, and it can also happen when you least expect it. For instance, one time I got hurt by simply getting out of bed one morning without stretching beforehand. I ended up pulling my hamstring and having to stay in bed for a couple of days after it occurred. This reminds me, stretching is very important for your body. If you don't stretch before doing exercise or just move your body, you can hurt yourself pretty badly. That's why I always make sure to do a full-body stretch first thing in the morning. I also stretch frequently throughout the day so I can stay limber. Limber...limber...lumber...lumber is made from trees. Usually, trees that are fully grown and straight will be chosen from a copse of trees and cut down to make lumber for houses and other projects requiring wood planks. Planks are a great exercise for your core muscles. To do planks, you get into a push-up position. However, instead of doing a pushup, you remain at the full lean-and-rest position with your body straight and resisting the urge to sag at the waist. This will ensure you are engaging the core muscles and working them sufficiently.

However, there were many other inventors such as Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci who also developed a talking telegraph. The telephone’s basic concept is simple: It transmits sound from one point to another. The microphone, which transforms our voice into an electrical signal, is its core technology. This electrical signal is then transmitted via a network of wires and cables to the telephone receiver, which converts the signal back into sound waves.\\"","output":"Once upon a time, a very clever man named Alexander Graham Bell made something we now know as the telephone. He was the first one to get a special paper called a patent, saying it was really and truly his idea! But, there were also other smart people like Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci who made a magical device that could send talking sounds over a long distance, just like a chatty telegraph. The telephone is actually a pretty simple thing: it's like a messenger that carries our voice from one place to another. The hero of this story is the microphone, a little part of the telephone that changes our words into a kind of electric language that the telephone understands. This electric language then races along a path of wires and cables until it reaches another telephone. There, it changes back into our voice, so the person on the other end can hear us.

Brown Sugar Milk Tea: Brown sugar is one of the most popular flavors right now. It's sweet and fresh. Plus, the boba is cooked in brown sugar syrup to add to the flavor. It's also known as tiger stripe boba in some locations. 3. Black Milk Tea: This classic is the most basic of basic flavors, but not in a bad way. It's slightly creamy with a low-key flavor for an excellent sip every time. 4. Thai Iced Tea: Thai iced tea is a little more flavorful. It's bright orange and sweet, spiced with cardamom, star anise, and more. It's sweetened with tasty condensed milk and sugar. 5. Strawberry Milk Tea: If you love berries, go for a strawberry milk tea option. It's made with strawberry powder or fresh strawberries, then sweetened with a creamer. It's usually thick and refreshing."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this so that a child could understand it A SIMPLE EXPLANATION Opal is formed from a solution of silicon dioxide and water. As water runs down through the earth, it picks up silica from sandstone, and carries this silica-rich solution into cracks and voids , caused by natural faults or decomposing fossils. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind a silica deposit. This cycle repeats over very long periods of time, and eventually opal is formed. Visualise the inside of an opal, like a bag of marbles. The marbles are the silica spheres. Smaller spheres are more commonly forming, and tend to defract the purple/ blue/ green colours. Larger spheres are rarer forming, and tend to show off the yellow/ orange/ pink and red colours. Hence why these are the rarer colours to find in Australian Opal.","output":"Opal is a special gemstone that is formed in a unique way. Imagine that opal is like a bag of marbles inside the Earth. These marbles are made of a shiny material called silica. Silica is a special kind of sand. When it rains, the water soaks into the ground and collects some of the silica from the sand. Then, the water travels through tiny cracks and holes in the Earth's rocks. These cracks can be made by things like fossils or natural breaks in the rocks. As the water with the silica inside it moves through these cracks, something magical happens. The water starts to evaporate, which means it turns into a gas and disappears. But when the water goes away, it leaves behind the silica it carried. Over a very long time, these silica deposits build up and form beautiful opal. The size of the silica spheres inside the opal is what gives it its colors. Smaller spheres make colors like purple, blue, and green. These colors are more common in opal. But larger spheres are rarer and make colors like yellow, orange, pink, and red. That's why you don't see those colors as often in opal."},{"instruction":"Can you write a story about a girl who sings karaoke and realizes she is destined to be a star?

Jackie went up first to perform, and everyone cheered at her silly rendition of Dancing Queen. It gave Christine a little more confidence to see the positive response, but she still was not convinced that this was a good idea. \\"You should go next, Christine!\\" said her friend, Max. Everyone joined in to encourage her, so she nervously made her way to the stage. Her face was bright red and her knees felt weak. The opening chords of I Can't Make You Love Me started to play as she gathered her breath. She tried to imagine herself alone in her bedroom, belting it out as she had many times before. Before she knew it, she was singing. The room fell quiet, listening intently to her passionate rendition. As she finished, she felt exhilarated. She ran back to her friends and practically collapsed into her chair. \\"I don't even know what to say, Christine,\\" said Max, smiling softly. \\"That was incredible.

Politics has roots all the way to the earliest known civilizations, including ancient Greece, Egypt, and the Roman Empire. These societies came up with elaborate systems of governing, with laws regulating allowed behavior, to keep their cities and communities functioning safely and smoothly. At its basic and most primitive form, politics was the art of managing the affairs of the community. As populations grew and become increasingly complex and diverse, they also began to interact more often with each other. This was a catalyst for exponential growth in the field of political science, giving rise to things like foreign policy, diplomacy, and especially warfare. The emergence of new empires and nations created new political systems, such as republics, monarchies, and democracies. Of course, in each political arena, there were many ideas as to what was best for everyone, which also led to new ideologies, including conservatism, socialism, and fascism. Many of these ideas still exist today in some form."},{"instruction":"Write a good mood song. Make it really cringy and REALLY bad.

What this means is that Jeet Kune Do (which means \\"Way of the Intercepting Fist\\") is a martial art that takes from other martial arts that which is useful and discards that which is useless. It employs any means to win a fight in the context of hand-to-hand combat - kicking, punching, grappling, biting, eye gouging, and so on. It is what today's martial artists would call \\"mixed martial arts,\\" or MMA for short. But it is not necessarily a martial art as we know it. Most, if not all, martial arts are crystallizations made up of sets and forms that prohibit and restrict their practitioners and make them contort their bodies into unusual positions like the \\"horse stance\\" or \\"cat stance.\\" Real fighting entails using your body to its fullest potential; locking it up in forms and stances only restricts the body from realizing its full potential. For instance, while you're getting into your horse stance, your opponent might kick you in your exposed groin. Jeet Kune Do is about being fluid, stopping or intercepting an attack with your weapons (fist, foot, etc.), and ending the fight as quickly as possible. Being fluid means becoming like water; it is yielding, and yet it is powerful enough to move large objects and crash with ferocity. It is also a mindset: instead of anticipating an opponent's attack, you simply \\"react\\" to it using your weapons and the skills you developed through practice and training. Intercepting means stopping an attack with a counterattack as it is being initiated. One of the most relevant examples of this concept in Jeet Kune Do is the use of the \\"stop kick.\\" The stop kick is used against an opponent when the opponent is lunging forward toward you in an attack; the side thrust or front thrust kick can literally stop the opponent in their tracks and prevent them from advancing further while also striking them in turn. Training up to this concept looks something like this: 1) learning to block; 2) learning to strike; 3) learning to block then strike; 4) learning to block and strike at the same time; 5) learning to strike without blocking by moving off the line of attack and moving into the opponent where they are open or exposed."},{"instruction":"List the steps of developing keywords with brief descriptions for each step.","output":"Sure!

Step 3: Use keyword research tools. This is another way to add to your list of keywords.

Can you tell me how the game works?","output":"Baseball is a game where two teams take turns at bat attempting to earn runs by hitting a baseball. When a player hits the ball, they run around three bases to reach home plate, which scores a run. The team in the field has the goal of stopping the other team from scoring runs by catching their hit balls in the air, throwing the ball to a base ahead of the runner, or tagging the runner out. Batters can also strike out by missing the ball with the bat 3 times or can earn a base if the pitcher throws 4 balls outside of the strike zone. At the end of 9 innings, the team with the most runs wins the game.

It would simplify the building process and ensure structural stability. However, the Store Street Aquaduct had to be built on a 45-degree skew. The builders pleaded with the city planners. They needed a workaround to avoid the skew, but the bureaucrats wouldn't say yes. William Jessop had been an engineer for Benjamin Outram, the lead architect for the project. Jessop suddenly remembered that his old boss, William Chapman, had already laid the roadwork they needed to travel on. Back in 1787, Chapman had a problem to deal with when he was building bridges for the Kildare Canal. When looking at the blueprints on a grid, Chapman suddenly realized he could use create a falsework parallel to the arches that would sustain the structure even with the odd skew. His work turned out successful, but Jessop and Outram had to perfect his plan if they wanted to successfully build the Store Street Aquaduct. Using the timber falsework method, the two builders marked out the position of the courses at the crown and the courses across the remainder of the arch. With that, thanks to Chapman's keen insight and Jessop's quick thinking, Outram completed the Store Street Aquaduct which still exists today."},{"instruction":"I made a lot of money in this recent market crash.","output":"Congrats!

Lungwort loves the shade and produces lovely pink and violet flowers. - Fuchsia: This plant produces trailing, teardrop-shaped flowers. Fuchsia hates the harsh sun, so a shady spot will keep it very happy. - Foxgloves: These plants produce tall, elegant flower clusters in a wide variety of colors.

Plank The plank is the most renowned exercise that targets your entire core. A plank is an exceptional way to strengthen your abs and your obliques and work your deep muscle to increase your overall stability and power. To perform a plank, start in a pushup position, then move down to rest your weight on your forearms with your hands touching so that your arms can form a V shape. From this position, maintain your straight posture and avoid your stomach sagging. Hold the position for as long as you can. It won't be long before you feel the burn. 2. Side plank Pay particular attention to your obliques by performing a side plank as an alternative to a normal plank. Start by getting into a standard plank position. Next, rotate your body so that one side of your body faces the sky. Squeeze your core with one leg straight out and your body stiff in a straight line. Squeeze your core and hold the pose for as long as possible before switching sides. Make sure to try equal lengths on both sides so that you don't get muscle imbalances. 3. Reverse Crunches Crunches are a great exercise for your core, but this variation adds a slight degree of difficulty if you are finding standard crunches too easy. This exercise works the lower abs, in particular. Start in a standard crunch position, lying down with your knees bent. Keep your hands flat on the ground next to your hips. To perform the exercise, lift your pelvis and knees towards your face. Return to the starting position and repeat as many times as you can. 4. Flutter kicks Sometimes the lower abs can get less attention, but flutter kicks can help to address that. This exercise makes sure you strengthen a common area of weakness. Lay flat on the ground with your arms flat and legs stretched out. From here, lift your feet about 6 inches off the ground and hold them there. Once you have done this, start lifting right and left. Lift each leg about a few inches each time. Ensure to maintain good posture and bring each leg to rest before moving to the next. 5. Arms high sit-ups Everyone knows sit-ups, and those who work their abs a lot may be easy by now. This exercise gives your abs a killer workout that they won't forget. It is as easy as starting in a sit-up position. From here, raise your hands straight up to the sky, flatten your hands, and reach for the sky. Now perform a sit-up as you normally would. This is going to be a lot harder than a standard sit-up so make sure your form is correct to achieve maximum results."},{"instruction":"Could I get an acrostic poem about everyone's favorite dessert, chocolate?!","output":"Cocoa in a hot mug is great for a long, cold day, Hiding in the cupboard is a chocolate bar screaming your name, Of course, there’s white chocolate for those who don’t like dark, Chocolate comes in all shapes and flavors for everyone to enjoy, Only the best desserts have the decadent delight, Late at night, sneak a bite, Add hazelnut or vanilla on top, The best taste on the planet, Everyone can enjoy!"},{"instruction":"Where do apples grow?","output":"Apples grow on trees."},{"instruction":"Can you buy a house with Cryptocurrency?","output":"Some companies allow that."},{"instruction":"How many teeth does an adult have?","output":"Humans have 32 teeth."},{"instruction":"Write a simple blessing for a child that can be cross-stitched as a gift for the child's parents to welcome a new baby.

Craig flirts with Elaine in front of Jerry, making him feel emasculated. Moreover, Elaine strongly endorses the jacket, thereby pressuring Jerry into buying it. Craig promises Elaine a discount on a Nicole Miller dress, but claims it sold out immediately after and is being restocked. George and Kramer begin parking at a discount parking lot. After picking up his car George discovers a condom inside and suspects prostitutes are servicing their clients inside the cars. The lot loses Kramer's keys, forcing him to use another customer's Mary Kay pink Cadillac Eldorado and sleep in Jerry's apartment. George questions the prostitutes hanging around. He offers one of them money for information, but is caught by Susan. Susan has no trouble believing him when he explains, to his frustration since he was hoping she might call off their wedding due to his seeming infidelity. The lot refuses to refund George's money, denying the prostitution allegations, and says George cannot reclaim his car for several days because it is parked in the back. George and Susan have a houseguest, Susan's friend Ethan, who is the \\"Wig Master\\" for a production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Ethan's co-worker, the show's costume designer, lends Kramer the technicolor dreamcoat. Wearing the coat, a woman's large hat blown off by the wind, and a silver-handled walking stick Elaine gave him after writing about it for the Peterman catalogue, Kramer goes to pick up the Cadillac. He finds a prostitute servicing a client in the car. When he ejects them, she starts attacking him over the fee he has cost her. Police arrive and assume Kramer to be a pimp due to his attire and fight with a prostitute, and arrest him. Fuming about Craig's slight toward him, Jerry unsuccessfully attempts to return his jacket in order to deny Craig the sales commission. When Jerry is lunching with Ethan, a friend of Ethan's stops by and sets up a get-together with him; Jerry demands to know why he assumed he and Ethan were not together. Jerry suspects Craig is just promising the discount on the dress in order to keep seeing Elaine. She doesn't believe it, especially when Craig promises the same discount to a male friend. When Elaine is over at Craig's apartment, his manager calls; she confirms from him that the dress has been in stock all along. In revenge, Elaine cuts off Craig's ponytail to sell for wig hair.","output":"• Jerry leaves a store without buying anything, he says he'll come back with a friend • The store clerk does not believe him • Jerry comes back with Elaine to prove the sale clerk wrong • The sales clerk flirts with Elaine causing Jerry to feel emasculated • Elaine likes the jacket so Jerry buys it • The salesman promises Elaine a discount • George and Kramer park at a discount lot • George discovers a condom in his car and suspects prostitutes have been using it • George tries to get info from prostitutes • The lot loses Kramer's keys • Susan's friend, Ethan, visits and gives Kramer a coat from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat • Kramer, dressed in the coat, with a hat and cane tries to get his car and fights with a prostitute • Kramer gets arrested • Jerry tries to return the jacket, but cannot • Jerry is lunching with Ethan when a friend of Ethan's comes by and asks him out which Jerry again feels emasculated by • Jerry suspects the sales clerk is lying to Elaine about the discount • Elaine asks the salesman's manager about a dress the salesman said was out of stock but the manager says it is in stock • Elaine enacts revenge by cutting off the salesman's ponytail"},{"instruction":"Write me part of a song about growth even in the face of difficulties.

Because while blog posts and freelance writing gigs are great ways to express your ideas and earn a side income, you can’t help feeling they’re a little, well, fleeting. Lightweight even.

Categorize the topic of the article. Category options: Comedy, Politics, Science, Health State legislatures are wrestling with how much to restrict or expand abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Here is a snapshot of pending and passed legislation seeking to restrict or protect access in 2023, including details on a law that took effect in North Dakota this week broadly banning abortion and the defeat of abortion ban bills in South Carolina and Nebraska. RESTRICTIONS FLORIDA: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban this month, which includes exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and the life and health of the mother. It cannot take effect until the state Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the 15-week ban that is currently in place. IDAHO: Idaho Governor Brad Little signed a bill this month that makes it illegal to help a minor cross state lines to get an abortion without the permission of a parent or guardian. Offenders would face two to five years in prison. The Republican-led state is currently enforcing a near-total abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. MONTANA: The Republican-led legislature has passed a bill seeking to overturn a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that found that the state constitution protected a right to abortion. That ruling has prevented lawmakers in the conservative state from restricting abortion further than the current 24-week limit. The bill awaits Republican Governor Greg Gianforte's signature. The full legislature has also passed a bill that would ban most second trimester abortions by prohibiting a common surgical procedure. If signed by the governor, it would take effect immediately. Planned Parenthood has sued to block the measure. NEBRASKA: Lawmakers in Nebraska's 50-seat unicameral legislature failed to pass a six-week abortion ban on Thursday, after the chamber did not amass enough votes to end debate on the bill. Much of the debate centered on one member's proposed amendment to allow abortions up to 12 weeks. Abortion is currently legal in the state up to 22 weeks. NORTH CAROLINA: House Republicans have introduced a bill to ban abortion from conception, except to preserve the life or health of the mother. Abortion is currently legal up to 20 weeks. If it passes the legislature, the bill would likely be vetoed by the Democratic governor and would need Democratic lawmakers' backing to override the veto. NORTH DAKOTA: North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on Monday signed a bill that bans abortion with exceptions for cases where the mother's life or health are at serious risk. The law, which took immediate effect, also makes exceptions for rape and incest victims, but only during the first six weeks of pregnancy. The measure passed despite the state Supreme Court's decision last month not to revive a previous version of the near-total ban, after finding that the state constitution protects abortion rights in some cases. SOUTH CAROLINA: The Republican-led House of Representatives is considering a six-week abortion ban that the Senate has passed, despite the fact that the state Supreme Court recently struck down a six-week abortion ban in a 3-2 vote. The Senate tabled discussion of a near-total abortion ban on Thursday after it had been approved by the House. The chamber voted to delay considering the bill until the next legislative session in January 2024, after a two-day filibuster by the five women senators who felt it was too severe. TEXAS: While abortion is completely banned with very limited exceptions in Texas, Republican state representatives have introduced legislation that would compel internet providers to block websites that supply abortion pills or provide information on how to obtain an abortion. UTAH: Republican Governor Spencer Cox in March signed legislation to prohibit the licensing of abortion clinics, which abortion rights advocates say would effectively eliminate access in the state. Abortion is currently banned after 18 weeks in Utah. WYOMING: The Republican-led state legislature passed a bill in March banning the use or prescription of medication abortion pills, and Republican Governor Mark Gordon signed it into law. It is due to take effect July 1. Abortion is currently legal until viability, about 24 weeks, while a state court is reviewing a challenge to a near-total \\"trigger\\" ban, which was took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned. PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIA: A Democratic state senator has introduced a bill to protect doctors who prescribe medication abortion pills to patients in other states. MICHIGAN: Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation this month repealing a 1931 bill that criminalized abortion. ILLINOIS: Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker in January signed a law protecting abortion providers and out-of-state patients from legal attacks waged by other states. MINNESOTA: Democratic Governor Tim Walz in January signed legislation passed by the Minnesota legislature's new Democratic majority that codifies abortion rights in state law, as well as a right to contraception and fertility treatment. The Democratic-led House passed a bill to shield abortion providers and patients from other states' legal attacks, and the Senate is considering it. OHIO: Abortion rights supporters are trying to collect enough signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2023 ballot that would assert a right to abortion. Abortion is currently legal up to 22 weeks.","output":"The topic of the article is politics."},{"instruction":"Change the characters to girls. Change Horse to Philippa and Max to Rachie So Saturday morning we met at the High School subway station. I got there first. Stuffed in my dad’s army surplus knapsack was a blanket, a pillow, a paper bag with three white-bread peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches – that is, lunch, supper, and Sunday breakfast. My pockets were full of stick matches. I had an old flashlight, and since I lived by the Scout’s motto – Be Prepared – I had brought along an umbrella. Finally, being a serious reader, I had the latest Marvel Family comics. Horse arrived next, his arms barely managing to hold on to a mattress that seemed twice his size. As for food, he had four cans of beans jammed into his pockets. Max came last. He was lugging a new knapsack that contained a cast-iron frying pan, a packet of hot dogs, and a box of saltine crackers – plus two bottles. One bottle was mustard, the other, celery soda. He also had a bag of Tootsie Rolls and a shiny hatchet. “To build a lean-to,” he explained. Max’s prize possession however was an official Scout compass. “It’s really swell,” he told us, “You can’t ever get lost with it. Got it at the Scout store.” “I hate that place,” Horse informed us. “It’s all new. Nothing real.” “This compass is real,” Max retorted. “Points north all the time. You can get cheaper ones, but they all point all different directions.” “What’s so great about the north?” Horse said. “That’s always the way to go,” Max insisted. “Says who?” I demanded. “Mr. Brenkman, dummy.” Horse cried. “Anyway, there’s always an arrow on maps pointing the way north.” “Cowboys live out west,” I reminded them. They didn’t care. On the subway platform, we realized we did not know which station we were heading for. To find out, we studied the system map, which looked like a noodle factory hit by a bomb. The place we wanted to go (north) was at the top of the map, so I had to hoist Horse onto my shoulders for a closer look. Since he refused to let go of his mattress – or the tin cans in his pockets – it wasn’t easy. I asked him- in a kindly fashion – to put the mattress down. No sooner did he find the station – 168th Street – than our train arrived. We rushed on, only to have Horse scream, “My mattress!” He had left it on the platform. Just before the doors shut, he and I leaped off. Max, however, remained on the train. Helplessly, we watched as his horror-stricken face slid away from us. “Wait at the next station!” I bellowed. “Don’t move!” The next train took forever to come. Then it took even longer to get to the next stop. There was Max. All around him – like fake snow in a glass ball – were crumbs. He’d been so nervous he had eaten all his crackers. “Didn’t that make you thirsty?” “I drank my soda.” I noticed streaks down his cheeks. Horse noticed them too. “You been crying?” he asked. Naw,” Max said. “There was this water dripping from the tunnel roof. But, you said don’t move, right? Well, I was just being obedient.” By the time we got on the next train – with all our possessions – we had been traveling for an hour. But we had managed to go only one stop. During the ride, I got hungry. I pulled out one of my sandwiches. With the jelly soaked through the bread, it looked like a limp scab. Horse, envious, complained he was getting hungry. “Eat some of your canned beans,” I suggested. He got out one can without ripping his pocket too badly. Then his face took on a mournful look. What’s the matter?” I asked. Forgot to bring a can opener.” Max said, “In the old days, people opened cans with their teeth.” “You saying I don’t know history?” Always kind, I plopped half my sandwich into Horse’s hand. He squashed it into his mouth and was quiet for the next fifteen minutes. It proved something I’d always believed: The best way to stop arguments is to get people to eat peanut butter sandwiches. They can’t talk. Then we became so absorbed in our Marvel Family comics we missed our station. We got to it only by coming back the other way. When we reached street level, the sky was dark.","output":"So on Saturday morning, we all gathered at the High School subway station. Being the early bird, I arrived first. In my dad's army surplus knapsack, I had packed a cozy blanket, a soft pillow, and a paper bag filled with three delicious white-bread peanut butter and jelly sandwiches—a perfect combination for lunch, supper, and Sunday breakfast. My pockets were filled with stick matches, and of course, I carried an old flashlight. Being a firm believer in the Scout's motto, \\"Be Prepared,\\" I had even brought along an umbrella. And being an avid reader, I made sure to bring the latest edition of the Marvel Family comics. Philippa arrived next, struggling to maintain her grip on a mattress that seemed twice her size. As for food, she had ingeniously managed to cram four cans of beans into her pockets. Rachie came last, carrying a brand-new knapsack that contained a sturdy cast-iron frying pan, a packet of hot dogs, a box of saltine crackers, and two bottles—one filled with mustard and the other with celery soda. She also proudly displayed a bag of Tootsie Rolls and a shiny hatchet, explaining that it would come in handy for building a lean-to. However, her most prized possession was an official Scout compass. Excitedly, she shared, \\"This compass is absolutely amazing. It never fails to point north, no matter what. I got it at the Scout store.\\" \\"I despise that place,\\" Philippa grumbled. \\"It's all new, nothing authentic.\\" \\"But this compass is real,\\" Rachie insisted. \\"It always points north. Sure, you can find cheaper ones, but they tend to point in all different directions.\\" \\"What's so great about the north?\\" Philippa questioned. \\"That's always the way to go,\\" Rachie declared. \\"Says who?\\" I challenged. \\"Mr. Brenkman, you silly. Besides, there's always an arrow on maps pointing the way north.\\" \\"But cowgirls live out west,\\" I reminded them, although they seemed unfazed by my remark. On the subway platform, we suddenly realized that we didn't know which station we were supposed to head to. To figure it out, we studied the system map, which resembled a tangled mess of noodles. The desired destination (north) was at the top of the map, so I hoisted Philippa onto my shoulders for a closer look. It wasn't easy since she stubbornly clung to her mattress and the tin cans in her pockets. In the kindest way possible, I asked her to set the mattress down. Just as she located the station—168th Street—our train arrived. We hurriedly boarded, but to our horror, Philippa screamed, \\"My mattress!\\" She had left it behind on the platform. With split-second timing, she and I leaped off just before the doors closed. Unfortunately, Rachie remained on the train, and we helplessly watched her panic-stricken face vanish into the distance. \\"Wait at the next station!\\" I shouted. \\"Don't move!\\" The next train seemed to take an eternity to arrive. And once it finally did, it took even longer to reach the next stop. There was Rachie, surrounded by crumbs that resembled fake snow in a glass ball. She had been so nervous that she ate all her crackers. \\"Didn't that make you thirsty?\\" I asked. \\"I drank my soda,\\" Rachie replied. I noticed streaks on her cheeks, and Philippa observed them too. \\"Have you been crying?\\" Philippa inquired. \\"Nah,\\" Rachie responded. \\"There was water dripping from the tunnel roof. But you said not to move, right? Well, I was just being obedient.\\" By the time we boarded the next train, lugging all our belongings, we had been traveling for an hour, yet we had only managed to cover one stop. As we rode, my stomach growled, signaling hunger. I reached into my bag and pulled out one of my sandwiches. The jelly had soaked through the bread, giving it a rather unappetizing appearance, resembling a limp scab. Philippa, feeling envious, complained that she was also getting hungry. \\"Why don't you eat some of your canned beans?\\" I suggested. She fumbled and managed to retrieve one can without tearing her pocket too badly. However, a mournful expression appeared on her face. \\"What's the matter?\\" I asked curiously. \\"I forgot to bring a can opener,\\" Philippa admitted, disappointment evident in her voice. Rachie chimed in, \\"You know, in the old days, people used to open cans with their teeth.\\" \\"Are you suggesting that I don't know history?\\" Philippa retorted defensively. Always one to be kind, I handed Philippa half of my sandwich. She gratefully accepted it and squished it into her mouth, silencing her hunger for the next fifteen minutes. It proved something I had always believed: the best way to quell arguments is to offer people peanut butter sandwiches. They simply can't argue with their mouths full. Lost in the captivating world of the Marvel Family comics, we became so engrossed that we missed our intended station. We had to backtrack and take the train in the opposite direction to finally reach our destination. When we emerged onto the street level, the sky had turned dark, casting an eerie atmosphere around us."},{"instruction":"My wife and I are looking for a movie to watch tonight with our two young children.

These inventions revolutionized industries such as textiles, transportation, and manufacturing, leading to the shift from agrarian and handcraft economies to ones dominated by industry and machine manufacturing."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me some creative ways to exercise my brain? I want to do it with the help of mental challenges. But don’t suggest anything that involves using any brain training apps or games.","output":"Here are some intensive and fun mental workouts to exercise your brain without using apps and games: 1. Expand Your Lexical Resources: A promising way to give your brain a workout is to learn new words. Reading books, articles, or even browsing online can expose you to new vocabulary that you can integrate into your everyday speech. 2. Dancing: Dancing is a fun way to exercise your body and your brain. By memorizing dance steps and coordinating movements, you challenge your brain's ability to learn and recall new motor skills. 3. Play Mind Games with a Friend: Engage in thought-provoking discussions or engage in debates with a friend to build your critical thinking skills. Listening to another person's perspective challenges your mind to analyze new information and think from different viewpoints. 4. Unleash Your Linguistic Prowess: Learning a new language broadens your cultural horizons and challenges your brain to absorb and recall unfamiliar words and grammar rules. You can learn from a tutor or self-study. 5. Flow with Tai Chi: Tai Chi is the perfect activity for you if you want to give your brain an excellent workout while also promoting relaxation. This ancient Chinese practice involves precise and deliberate movements that improve balance, coordination, and mindfulness by engaging your brain and body simultaneously. It's also a low-impact activity that's accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels. 6. Teach with Passion: Have you ever thought of becoming a teacher? While you don't have to become a professional educator, teaching someone else a new skill gives your brain a good workout. It requires you to understand the material, and it necessitates patience, creativity, and communication skills, all of which are beneficial to your cognitive abilities. 3. Sense it All: Did you know that using all of your senses regularly can help keep your brain sharp? Whether it's tasting new cuisine, listening to an unfamiliar musical genre, or smelling new fragrances, experiences that stimulate multiple senses can help create new neural pathways in your brain. It is also an exciting way to broaden your horizons by discovering new sensory experiences."},{"instruction":"Write a limerick about Twitter.

Margaret Cavendish may have published the very first science fiction novel in 1666, The Blazing World. It features animal-human hybrids, an empress of a parallel planet, and time and space travel, at a time when such speculation was still considered heretical. Inspiration for sci-fi writers often stemmed from their fascination with science and space exploration. Incredibly, some authors were spot-on forecasted technologies way before their time, particularly Jules Verne. He offered space travel, tunneling through the earth's core, and deep sea exploration. Sci-fi provides a welcome form of escapism, too. During World War I, the Tom Swift series described wartime technologies that were desperately needed in real-life (aerial warships, surveillance cameras, and tanks that could cross trenches). These stories appealed to readers' optimism in the midst of loss. Dystopian Fiction has regained popularity during these times of uncertainty in political, technological, global economic, and human rights infringements. The Handmaid's Tale and 1984 are prime examples due to recent changes in governmental leadership and debates about global immigration policies. As long as people dare to dream about the future, science fiction will remain popular.","output":"1. Aerial Warships 2. Surveillance cameras 3. Tanks that could cross trenches"},{"instruction":"Classify this review as either positive or negative and explain your response: Last year, I committed to reading one memoir every month and have since enjoyed some fascinating, real-life stories, some of the celebrity kind, but mostly about ordinary people and their extraordinary experiences. This account by Michelle Zauner disappointingly falls into neither category. In terms of “memoir,” it mostly revolves around the death of her mother from colon cancer, with some references to the challenges of being biracial and connecting with her Korean roots. By far the greatest part of the book, however, is taken up by descriptions of Korean food: buying the ingredients, preparing and cooking them, and then eating the final dishes. Whole pages devoted to gushing prose about this or that culinary experience. Okay, so food was the thing that connected Zauner to her mother. But, I got that message within the first two chapters. I didn’t need it rammed down my throat ad nauseum. About half way through, I started skipping the “foodie” pages completely. Zauner can write; there’s no doubt about that. The chapters describing her mother’s slow decline and death are visceral and poignant. But, the book as a whole feels terribly self-indulgent. There is nothing in it that is particularly remarkable; no profound insights or lessons. My feeling is that Zauner wrote this “memoir” as a form of personal catharsis. And if she achieved this, then I’m happy for her. For me, though, the hype is totally overblown. Except, perhaps, if you’re keen to know how to cook authentic Korean food. Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful. You can find more candid book reviews on my Amazon profile page.","output":"This is a negative review. The reviewer is disappointed with Michelle Zauner's memoir, finding it lacking in fascinating stories and celebrity experiences.

Please give me basic descriptions of each style and make the suggestions appropriate for someone who doesn't know much about makeup.","output":"It's cool that you're getting into makeup! Here's a list of some different makeup styles. 1. Matte - Matte Makeup is easy to do, and it works well in humidity or oily skin. What makes this makeup style stand out is that it doesn't use products with gloss. Everything used in this style is Matte and lasts a long time. 2. Dewy Glow - The Dewy Glow makeup style has a fresh appearance that isn't greasy. It's sort of an in-betweener, going between no makeup and a full face. Dewy Glow makeup is a little flushed, so it helps to use shimmery blush on your cheeks, and lip gloss will help make your lips look juicy. 3. Airbrush - The airbrush makeup style doesn't use regular sponges or brushes. It uses an airbrush. Airbrush makeup looks high-definition, and it can provide variety in textures, shades, and finishes. You can use airbrush makeup in a sheer or heavy way, and it lasts up to 16 hours. Therefore, it's great if you need your makeup to stay for a long time. 4. Monochromatic - Monochromatic makeup is what it sounds like, it uses one tone. You can use the same palette to cover your lips, eyes, and cheeks. This makeup style is nice because it doesn't take much effort but looks balanced. 5. Alternative - Alternative makeup is creative and challenges societal standards of beauty. Alternative makeup uses lots of deep and bold colors, and it's meant to stand out. Alternative makeup can be done with falsies, heavy eyeliners, and vivid lip colors."},{"instruction":"Write an apology letter to my mom as if you are Elmo.

It came with instructions to plant in an area with full sun and acidic soil with plenty of drainage. I'm not really sure how to describe it, the only way I can think of it is as a sort of aggressive lily or slightly flaccid amaryllis. I have found a nice spot in the garden, and initially, it seemed to be doing well, however, after just a short time, it has started to wilt. Could you please help? Yours with hope, Wilted Wendy Dear Wendy, From the description offered by the seller, this may well be a variety of the well-reported 'Audry 2' exotic plant species. These are fascinating plants that, if kept in check, can be a delightful and colorful addition to any sun-soaked border. The merchant was right to point you toward well-draining soil, as they do not like having damp feet. They require a lot of nutrients to keep going, though, so make sure you offer it plenty of plant food, at least weekly, when watering around the roots. Occasionally it will want animal products delivered through what looks like its mouth at the top of the plant, and you can either prick a finger to provide some blood or, if you prefer, catch small animals and insects to feed it. Be very careful, as this is an invasive species that can spread uncontrollably if allowed to. If it gets big enough to start talking, then it is best to take some small cuttings and really work hard to prevent any unfortunate and excessive bloodshed. Good luck, and do let us know how it goes!

Please rewrite these sentences into something that is easy to understand. Restate the medical terms into everyday words. The Rabies virus, like the vast majority of other pathological microorganisms, attempts to perpetuate itself with general and reservoir host-specific mechanisms, which ultimately confer a considerable epidemiological plasticity. The pace and phenotype of rabies infection are mostly written in the virus genome, whilst transmission is strongly favoured by aggressive behaviours (i.e., a biting inclination) of rabid hosts (37). Despite incidence and mortality of rabies disease have both markedly declined during the past three decades (Fig. 1), and irrespective of whether the genetic code of Rabies virus can be naturally (i.e., by ecological opportunities and viral adaptation) or artificially (i.e., by genetic engineering) modified, we need to think “out-of-the-box”, in that the generation of a “Zombie virus” cannot be firmly excluded according to the currently available biological evidence (38). Wavefront velocity of rabies disease propagation has been calculated in wild animals (e.g., foxes, skunks, raccoons and vampire bats) at around 10-40 km per year (37). However, in densely populated towns, where natural landscape barriers would be minimal, the human-to-human contagion may increase by several orders of magnitude, thus easily assuming apocalyptic proportions and creating a new generation of pseudo-human creatures, who have completely unleashed their already existing part of zombie within (39). In keeping with this conjecture, an interesting simulation of an imaginary Zombie outbreak reveals that most of the US population would turn into Zombies within one week from appearance of the first case, whilst only some remotes zones in Montana and Nevada would remain infestation-free one month afterwards (40).","output":"The rabies virus, like most deadly viruses, can change the way they act in response to environmental changes. The rabies virus is transmitted by an infected animal biting another animal because that is the way the virus evolved. The number of people bitten by rabid animals and the number of people dying from rabies has dramatically declined over the past 30 years. However, scientists are concerned that the rabies virus could, through natural mutation or genetically engineered mutation, change into a virus that would turn infected people into \\"zombies\\". Wild animals, such as foxes, skunks, raccoons and vampire bats usually transmit rabies in about a ten-mile area. Unfortunately, there are no natural barriers, such as forests or rivers, to keep infected animals from entering our crowded cities. It would be easy for a wild animal carrying the mutated rabies virus to bite a person and kick off a zombie apocalypse. Like any rabid animals, infected people would bite and infect those around them, thus creating a race of zombies. A simulation of such an event projected that it would only take about a week from the first bite before most of the US population became zombies. For people living in remote areas of Nevada or Montana, it would only take a month before the zombies found them and turned them into zombies."},{"instruction":"Write a creative snapshot of a story depicting a summer evening on a farm with a full moon, when everything feels magnetic but changes suddenly, and the protagonist is about to meet someone important but not quite yet.","output":"She carried the rocking chair out to the side porch and sat down for the evening, facing the open pasture south of her home, and stared down to the strip of woodline. The sun, descending down the meadow of the next hill, thinned the silhouettes of the cedar trunks. Three railed fences crossed the pasture stream and squared to a barn open on the other side. The August moon rose orange and full in the haze of dusk and mimicked a binary sunset. But all she thought of was tomorrow's work. She sipped the stew in her bowl and ate a chunk of potato from the spoon. Though she was hot from the day's chores, a stew was convenient to brew come morning and be ready by dinner, and it softened the gamey rabbit cuts in a bath of salted broth and lard. The hens made their way back up the run and cooed through the screened window. Ludor, a Jersey cow, swatted her tail at flies landing on her backside and watched the sunset from the other side of the fence. Her calf would be here very soon. The woman stood up from her rocker and leaned against the porch post. More firewood would be chopped tomorrow, but at last, she sighed a relieving breath and opened to summer's ambience as the cool mountain air was pulled in.

Can you provide me with some tips for potty training? The more the better, so give me a list of at least 5 but more if possible.","output":"1. Follow a consistent schedule. Always feed your dog at the same time every day. This helps to develop a routine of when the dog will need to go outside, and you can anticipate when those times will be. 2. Confinement. When you are in the house, the puppy should either be in a crate or immediately next to you. An easy way to accomplish this is to attach their leash directly to you - perhaps hook it on your waist. This means the puppy cannot sneak away and have an accident without you noticing. 3. Crate. If you cannot watch your puppy closely, give them time in a crate that is not too large. Puppies do not like to eliminate where they sleep and should not have an accident in the crate. Keep the duration of this relatively short during the day, and take the puppy outside to relieve themselves immediately upon leaving the crate. 4. Frequency. Initially take your puppy outside often - this means after every time the puppy eats or drinks and every 30 minutes to an hour during the day during the early stages of housebreaking. 5. Relief area. If possible, take your puppy to the exact same area to relieve themselves, and only spend 5 minutes outside. If the puppy does not relieve itself within 5 minutes, go back inside and play for 5 minutes and then go outside and try again. This helps the puppy to learn that outside is for relieving only and inside is for playing. 6. Cue. Choose a word or a command to tell your puppy to go to the bathroom. For example \\"Go Potty\\" or \\"Go Busy.\\" Start by saying the command after the puppy has started relieving itself. In later days, say it before the puppy begins so it can identify what you want it to do. 7. Praise. Always praise your puppy for a job well done. This can be with a treat or just verbal praise, but get excited and let your puppy know how great it is that they are going to the bathroom where you want them to. 8. No yelling. When your puppy inevitably has an accident inside the house, do not yell or scold. The dog will not understand why you are upset, and it won't teach them anything. Simply clean up the mess and vow to watch them more closely the next time."},{"instruction":"What is the measurement of computer mouse speed called?

The study found a link between severe sleep apnea in older adults and greater amounts of a specific biomarker in the brain—one that could increase people’s risk of dementia or stroke. More research will be needed to understand this connection, however. Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep. This causes the brain to wake the person just enough to start breathing, only for the cycle to start again once the person falls back asleep. There are two main forms of sleep apnea, obstructive and central. Obstructive apnea happens when airway muscles physically block a person’s breathing, while central apnea is when the brain forgets to signal the body to breath (a third mixed form has features of both). Though not all snoring is linked to obstructive sleep apnea, it’s a common sign of the condition (snoring in general is caused by a narrow airway while sleeping). The constant interruptions caused by apnea also make it hard for people to get a restful night’s sleep, which can then affect their physical and mental health in varying ways. Sleep apnea, especially when severe, has been linked to a greater risk of many other health problems, including cardiovascular disease. In this new study, published Thursday in the journal Neurology, scientists wanted to get a better understanding of how the condition could possibly affect the brain. They looked at data collected from 140 older adults with obstructive sleep apnea who had participated in an earlier study. These volunteers had undergone an MRI brain scan and were monitored overnight in a sleep lab. They were divided into three groups based on their diagnosed degree of sleep apnea, but all of them were thought to be free of dementia at the start and end of the study period.\\"","output":"Here are the key points from this article: A study has found that sleep apnea can lead to very serious health problems, specifically in older adults. Firstly, there are three types of sleep apnea - obstructive, central, and a mix of both. Obstructive is when airway muscles block someone's breathing, and central is when the brain doesn't send signals to the body to breathe. The health risks include cardiovascular disease, dementia, or even strokes depending on the severity.

The app is primarily known for its short-form videos and viral dance challenges. Many children and even adults have been hooked on the short style of videos and the entertainment it provides. Although TikTok is used by many people to share their struggles and experiences, it has harmed many people's lives. Attention span has been reduced due to the short format videos, and watching a long video exceeding 2 minutes or reading a paragraph can be difficult for some who lose track of what they are doing. This affects a person's mental health, as it reduces their ability to stay focused for long periods of time, which can create anxiety outside of short format videos such as TikTok. Another problem that is slowly creeping up is that TikTok has contributed to a lot of people's confidence and self-esteem dropping. This is because they are exposed to videos that portray the 'perfect body' or 'perfect life.' Young people see these videos and reflect on themselves, which can hugely decrease their confidence, hence having a massive effect on a young person's view of the world and themselves. In terms of who it would affect most, it would be younger children, as they are the ones who are easily influenced. Seeing thousands of videos in the span of a few hours can have a toll on a young person's mind, which is curious, and views. TikTok can be used moderately where it is not affecting you personally, and you are able to watch it without it affecting your day-to-day life by moderating the time you spend on the app."},{"instruction":"Write about someone dreading something, but keep it mysterious and then reveal what it is as a funny twist.

Five tenants of the Iowa apartment building that collapsed on Sunday are still unaccounted for, city officials admitted during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. More than 36 hours after the rear section of a six-storey apartment complex on 324 Main Street collapsed, Davenport Mayor Mike Matson revealed that local police have been unable to locate five residents. “The Davenport Police Department has been working diligently to account for the [residents] of the building ... Five individuals are still unaccounted for, two of those we believe to possibly be still in the building,” Mr Matson said. Mr Matson’s statement comes amid protests by family members outside of the site of the collapse after the city announced plans to begin a demolition process. On Tuesday morning, a crowd gathered in front of the building with signs reading “Corruption Collapses Communities” and chanting “Save Branden, save Ryan!” Experts said the structure, built in the 1900s is extremely unstable. Because of the layout of the building, with the rear brick part holding together much of the steal structure, officials said there were likely no void spaces where trapped victims could have shielded.

Someone said I should have a few tools around for gigs. Give me a list of tools I should keep in a bag in case something goes wrong on stage.","output":"Here is a list of tools you should have in your gig bag: - A small multi-screwdriver. This can be handy for tightening loose screws on equipment or making sure the knobs on your gear are secure. There are hobbyist screwdrivers that have multiple tips stored in the body or shaft. In a pinch, you could even use the mini toolset for repairing eyeglasses. These sets are often cheap and low quality, but the screwdrivers tend to be good enough for a quick fix on stage. - A flashlight. While there may be stage lighting during the performance, if you need to make a quick repair, it is better to have a small but effective light source of your own, in case of emergencies. You can certainly use the big bulky one from home, but a pen light might be more effective and easier to use when you need to hold tools as well. If hands-free is your thing, you could also get a headlamp, which usually has a small strap attached to it. But if you have a modern cell phone, you probably already have an app that turns on the camera flash. - Pliers. A small pair of pliers can work wonders for a bent jack or for cutting and replacing a broken string. They don’t need to be too big, and you can usually find a small set of two or three at your favorite hardware store. - Allen/hex key set. These might not be completely necessary for certain players, but Allen screws are used on a lot of musical equipment, so it would be a good idea to have a set around. While you can buy keys as a set for a toolbox, keep on the lookout for a set that looks like a Swiss Army knife, commonly called a Gui-Tool. These specialty tools often have screwdriver bits built in, making it a very effective multi-tool to have in your arsenal. Although there are far more tools available, this should get you started and have you prepared for many unforeseen circumstances at your show.

You'll need a tire pressure gauge, which is available at most gas stations and auto shops. 2. For each of your tires, remove the air valve cap on the tire and put it somewhere close so you do not lose it. 3. Push the tire pressure gauge onto the valve stem until you hear air coming out. Press for one to two seconds. 4. Read the pressure. 5. Compare the gauge reading to the recommended tire pressure. If you do not know, this can be found in your vehicle's manual. Replace the tire valve cap. 6. Repeat for each wheel. Inflating a Car Tire 1. Park your car close enough to the air compressor so that you can reach each tire with the compressor's hose. 2. Remove the valve cap from the tire and store it somewhere secure. 3. Push the hose nozzle down onto the valve stem. You should notice the tire inflating as well as feel the air flowing through the hose. 4. When you think it's enough, remove the hose and use the pressure gauge to see what the new pressure of the tire is. If not enough, continue to inflate that tire until the correct psi is achieved. 5. Repeat this process for the other tires on the vehicle. 6. Do not forget to replace the valve caps on each tire."},{"instruction":"Can you give me a paragraph of tips on building a chicken coop? Focus on the recommended size and materials.","output":"The size and shape of chicken coops is usually determined by the number of chickens to be housed. A general rule of thumb is to allow at least four square feet of space per chicken. If your flock will have limited access to the outdoors, you should look at chicken coops that provide up to ten square feet of space per chicken. Built-in features like roosts and nesting boxes will make your chickens comfortable and encourage them to lay plenty of eggs. Adding a fenced run that is a great way to let your birds enjoy the outdoors while protecting them from predators. Building materials are another important consideration when shopping for a chicken coop. Avoid building materials that may rot, harbor pests or be toxic to chickens. At the same time, you want to choose a material that is sturdy and durable. Repurposed wood is perfectly acceptable if you're building your own coop, but you need to make sure that the lumber you use is treated to prevent wood rot and mold. Regulate the temperature and humidity in your coop by installing proper insulation and ventilation."},{"instruction":"What does BTW mean?","output":"That's easy."},{"instruction":"When did the Beatles make music history?","output":"You can Google that."},{"instruction":"Why aren't you helping?","output":"I don't know what you mean."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a rock climber that climbs the steepest mountain but has a cliffhanger at the end.

Alex knew that, every time he does what he loves, there was always a chance he could never see his family again. He took his first step. He was now mentally ready. Step by step, he climbed up the mountain. The higher he got, the more resistance he was met with. It was also getting hard for Alex to reach and grab ahead of him, which put a toll on his stamina.

What are some ways I can earn additional income without being tied to a specific schedule or having to meet a minimum number of work hours per week? Give me at least 2 suggestions that are related to writing/editing.","output":"No problem; here are some ways to earn additional income where you can set your own schedule and work minimal hours: -Drive for a ride-share service - If you have a car in decent shape and a good driving record, you can sign up to drive for Uber or Lyft. With these platforms, you can set your own schedule. -Sign up with a delivery service - Many delivery services like Instacart will allow delivery drivers to set their own schedules. -Take surveys online - There are many different platforms that pay users low rates to take surveys online, such as MTurk, Prolific, Springboard Panel, and Ipsos. The pay rate is usually relatively low, but you'll have a lot of freedom to set your own schedule and decide which surveys are (or aren't) worth your time. -Sign up for pet-sitting services - Platforms like Rover.com allow you to market yourself as a dog walker or pet sitter. You can visit other people's homes to check on their pets or host their pets at your home for a single day or multiple overnight stays. You'll have the power to decline any offer that doesn't suit your schedule. -Sign up for focus groups - With focus groups, you can get paid just to share your opinion on products or entertainment. These groups often require you to be present in person or virtually for specific hours, but you can always decline if the scheduled time doesn't work for you. The same is true of signing up for mock juries. -Become a mystery shopper - There are several different services that will pay you to visit stores and businesses as an undercover quality control analyst. Typically, they'll provide you with a checklist of things to review in the store and very clear instructions. All you have to do is visit the spot in question on your own time, follow the directions, and get paid. If the directions require you to make a purchase, the company will reimburse you. -Sell arts and crafts - If you've got a hobby (or more than one) that produces marketable products, consider selling them on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Shopify. If your schedule is unpredictable, consider setting a shop policy that informs buyers that you're only available to ship items and respond to customer inquiries on certain days/times each week. You can also sell these items on your own website or at craft vendor fairs. -Re-sell used items - There are plenty of websites and brick-and-mortar stores where you can sell your used clothes, electronics, furniture, appliances, and more. -Sign up for a copywriting platform - You may want to do some research on these platforms to determine which is the best fit, as some do require their writers to meet a monthly minimum of work hours. Some don't, though, and will simply list available short-term copywriting projects for you to take or leave as you see fit. -Start your own small business - You can work with clients as a writing coach, editor, or in any other capacity you feel qualified to. It will be up to you to determine when you meet with clients and for how long. You can also set your own pay rate."},{"instruction":"I want the beginning of a slightly magical modern-day story about a toothbrush trying desperately to be together with toothpaste, no dialogue is needed","output":"Night came, and as the man finished brushing his teeth, he put his toothbrush in a cup, turned off the lights, and went to bed. But things still stirred in that house; you see, the toothbrush was glad to have served its purpose once more, but it longed to be together with the tube of toothpaste just across the bathroom counter. Its heart ached to be close to the toothpaste, and it was gleeful for the mere moments in which they would be together before spending so much time apart -- until the next time the man needed to brush his teeth. And all it could do was stare longingly, wishing it had the means to reach the object of its affection. With such a strong desire, something must have taken pity on the poor toothbrush, as sparkles hit the bristles of the toothbrush, and suddenly, it could move! Well, nudge really, but this was more than the toothbrush was ever capable of before, and it wasted no time. The toothbrush nudged, nudged, and nudged again, hoping to escape the confines of the cup the human placed it in. It struggled and struggled until it was able to use its weight and force to knock the cup down, giving it the chance to nudge right out of the cup. It made moves, making sure its handle was completely out of the cup, before nudging itself towards the tub of toothpaste. However, it came across a possible problem; between it and the toothpaste was a large chasm, known as the \\"sink\\". If it fell into the sink, there was no way it would be able to get itself out, not until the human awoke and made use of it once more. The toothbrush could try to get around it, but it would have to travel around the outside, and there was a chance it could fall onto the floor too. That might be an even worse fate, as no doubt if the human found it on the floor, it could very well be thrown away, forever separated from its beloved toothpaste. Yet it was clear, there was only one option. It was not going to return to the cup, it was already too late for that. The only path ahead was around the sink, risking falling to the floor, to reach the only thing it ever wanted to be close to."},{"instruction":"Create a concise emergency broadcast script for a CNN host announcing an extraterrestrial pandas invasion!","output":"[Emergency Broadcast Script] CNN HOST: Good evening.

Enough power to help defend the village from the dragon that lords up in the mountain. Kotone prays that she isn't the one that receives this power. Every day her wish gets granted, but this one day, she wasn't so lucky. The fountain starts to glow, and from below, a geyser shoots up and douses the village in rain. Kotone steps back and looks at herself. She is glowing, her dark hair starts to levitate, and the water starts to surround her. She was picked as this generation's healer. The village folk all walk out and look at her, fascinated and scared. An older woman starts to walk up to Kotone and says to her \\"You have received the blessing of the goddess, and now you must undertake the trial of healers like the women from generations past.\\" Kotone didn't want this, but she couldn't refuse. Her destiny was already decided. The trial was to take part tomorrow, in the forest close to the village. The trial was a simple one. Escape a well and return to the village within seven days and pray. Kotone has never done training like this. She was only given a day's worth of food and two books. One was the history of the women that received the blessing. The other was more practical, detailing how to use her newly found power. She has doubts about if she can do this. She walks to the well with various members of the village surrounding her so she can't run away. Along the way, one of the men collapses out of nowhere. Everyone, including Kotone, ran to the man's side. It looks like he has contracted an illness that started to show signs now. At this moment, Kotone comes up with an idea.

Ron Francis signed a contract to remain general manager of the Seattle Kraken on Wednesday, running through the 2026-27 season. The 60-year-old has been Kraken GM since they joined the NHL as an expansion team for the 2021-22 season. Seattle clinched a Stanley Cup Playoff berth this season and advanced to Game 7 of the Western Conference Second Round, a 2-1 loss at the Dallas Stars. The Kraken went 46-28-8 to clinch the first wild card into the postseason from the West and eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in seven games in the first round. Seattle finished 27-49-6, the third-worst record in the League, in its first NHL season. \\"Every year is different; every year is unique. There's always challenges,\\" Francis told NHL.com on April 11. \\"But I think for us, it's certainly been more gratifying than the first year.\\" Francis was Carolina Hurricanes GM from 2014-18 and worked in their front office for 12 seasons before the Kraken hired him July 18, 2019. Seattle stood pat before the 2023 NHL Trade Deadline on March 3 but set NHL records in wins and points (100) for a second-year team and for the greatest improvement from a team's first to second season (19 wins, 40 points). Seattle moved 18 spots in the standings, second-most this season behind the New Jersey Devils (plus-25). Forward Jared McCann (40 goals) and center Matty Beniers (24) were the only two Kraken players to top 23 goals for a team that averaged 3.52 goals per game, which tied the Devils for fourth in the NHL. Beniers is a finalist for the Calder Trophy, voted as NHL rookie of the year, along with Buffalo Sabres defenseman Owen Power and Edmonton Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner. \\"I think every GM, his goal starting is to get into the playoffs,\\" Francis said. \\"Certainly, it's no different for me and my team. The biggest thing for us to be able to show improvement from where we were last year as a new franchise in a new market, trying to show our fan base that, hey, we're getting better, we're moving in the right direction was what we were trying to accomplish. I might be lying a little bit if I said I saw it going this well, but it has and that's a kudos to our players and our coaching staff and the effort that they've put in to get to this point.\\" Francis, a center who played 22 NHL seasons, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007. He is fifth in League history with 1,798 points (549 goals, 1,249 assists) in 1,731 games with the Hartford Whalers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Hurricanes and Toronto Maple Leafs. The two-time Stanley Cup winner with Pittsburgh (1991, 1992) is second in NHL history in assists, trailing Wayne Gretzky (1,963).","output":"Brent: Hey man, did you see Ron Francis signed a four-year extension with the Seattle Kraken? That'll keep him here through 2026-2027. Ronnie: Dude, I know. I just saw that.

Not to mention we beat the Colorado Avalanche in round 1, which was amazing. Brent: But we did so badly last year, finishing third-worst in the NHL. I'm not sure anyone could have seen this coming. Ronnie: Did you see what Ron had to say about it? He was talking about how this year is so much more gratifying than last year. I'm glad we got him from Carolina to be our GM. Brent: Me too. I mean, after all, we set a record in points for a second-year team and showed tremendous improvement. We even did it all with only one forty-goal scorer and only two people above twenty-three goals. That's nuts! Ronnie: Don't forget about our boy Matty Beniers who could win the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year! The man was a menace! Brent: Ron also mentioned that he didn't see us doing as well as we did this year but it was amazing to see and that's a huge shout-out to the coaches and players. He's such a humble and honest guy.

On April 20, 2023, a new SpaceX rocket called Starship exploded over the Gulf of Mexico three minutes into its first flight ever. SpaceX is calling the test launch a success, despite the fiery end result. As a space policy expert, I agree that the “rapid unscheduled disassembly” – the term SpaceX uses when its rockets explode – was a very successful failure. A large rocket standing next to a tower. The full Starship stack comprises a Starship spacecraft (in black) on top of a rocket dubbed Super Heavy (in silver) and is nearly 400 feet (120 meters) tall. Hotel Marmot/Flickr, CC BY-SA The most powerful rocket ever built This launch was the first fully integrated test of SpaceX’s new Starship. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed and is designed to be fully reusable. It is made of two different stages, or sections. The first stage, called Super Heavy, is a collection of 33 individual engines and provides more than twice the thrust of a Saturn V, the rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s. The first stage is designed to get the rocket to about 40 miles (65 kilometers) above Earth. Once Super Heavy’s job is done, it is supposed to separate from the rest of the craft and land safely back on the surface to be used again. At that point the second stage, called the Starship spacecraft, is supposed to ignite its own engines to carry the payload – whether people, satellites or anything else – into orbit. An explosive first flight While parts of Starship have been tested previously, the launch on April 20, 2023, was the first fully integrated test with the Starship spacecraft stacked on top of the Super Heavy rocket. If it had been successful, once the first stage was spent, it would have separated from the upper stage and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship would then have continued on, eventually crashing 155 miles (250 kilometers) off of Hawaii. Read news coverage based on evidence, not tweets During the SpaceX livestream, the team stated that the primary goal of this mission was to get the rocket off the launch pad. It accomplished that goal and more. Starship flew for more than three minutes, passing through what engineers call “max Q” – the moment at which a rocket experiences the most physical stress from acceleration and air resistance. A cloud of fire and smoke in the sky with pieces falling Earthward. The Starship spacecraft and Super Hheavy rocket were unable to separate during the flight, so engineers blew up the full rocket. AP Photo/Eric Gay According to SpaceX, a few things went wrong with the launch. First, multiple engines went out sometime before the point at which the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy rocket were supposed to separate from each other. The two stages were also unable to separate at the predetermined moment, and with the two stages stuck together, the rocket began to tumble end over end. It is still unclear what specifically caused this failure. Starship is almost 400 feet (120 meters) tall and weighs 11 million pounds (4.9 million kilograms). An out-of-control rocket full of highly flammable fuel is a very dangerous object, so to prevent any harm, SpaceX engineers triggered the self-destruct mechanism and blew up the entire rocket over the Gulf of Mexico. All modern rockets have mechanisms built into them that allow engineers to safely destroy the rocket in flight if need be. SpaceX itself has blown up many of its own rockets during testing. Success or failure? Getting to space is hard, and it is not at all unusual for new rockets to experience problems. In the past two years, both South Korea and Japan have attempted to launch new rockets that also failed to reach orbit. Commercial companies such as Virgin Orbit and Relativity Space have also lost rockets recently. None of these were crewed missions, and in most of these failed launches, flight engineers purposefully destroyed the rockets after problems arose. SpaceX’s approach to testing is different from that of other groups. Its company philosophy is to fail fast, find problems and fix them with the next rocket. This is different from the more traditional approach taken by organizations such as NASA that spend far more time identifying and planning for possible problems before attempting a launch. The traditional approach tends to be slow. The development of NASA’s Space Launch System – the rocket that will take astronauts to the Moon as part of the Artemis program – took more than 10 years before its first launch this past November. SpaceX’s method has allowed the company to move much faster but can be costlier because of the time and resources it takes to build new rockets. SpaceX engineers will look to identify the specific cause of the problem so that they can fix it for the next test launch. With this approach, launches like this first Starship test are successful failures that will help SpaceX reach its eventual goal of sending astronauts to Mars.","output":"SpaceX, rocket, Starship, flight, test launch, space, rockets, Super Heavy, engines, thrust, Saturn V, astronauts, moon, earth, craft, spacecraft, payload, satellites, orbit, mission, launch pad, engineers, max Q, acceleration, air resistance, Virgin Orbit, Relativity Space, crewed missions, flight engineers, NASA's Space Launch System, Artemis program, Mars"},{"instruction":"Come up with a conversation between three friends who are having a \\"locker room conversation\\" using the innuendo, \\"If you know what I mean\\" to infer something that they all know what it means.","output":"Friend 1 (1)/Friend 2 (2)/Friend 3 (3) 1: I'm having a grand old time tonight if you know what I mean. 2: You gonna go out with Stacy tonight? 1: Yep, 8:30 dinner. 3: I'll bet she's gonna love the calamari if you know what I mean! 2: In fact, you two might just have to get a doggy bag if you know what I mean! 1: We'll definitely be getting room service dessert later if you know what I mean. 2: What about you, 3?

Here’s the source text to use for information: Flat sheets form a protective layer between yourself and your comforter or duvet, preventing body oils or dirt from transferring to your top layer. But the need for flat sheets is a debated subject — nearly 6 in 10 Americans think flat sheets are essential, while others opt out of flat sheets altogether. Whether you’re team flat sheet or not, you can’t deny that finding the right material can make all the difference. Whether you prefer breathable percale sheets or irresistibly soft sateen sheets, using the right sheets can help you sleep like a baby. How to Use a Flat Sheet Lay the flat sheet across your bed in the same orientation as your bedding. Center the flat sheet on your bed, making sure there’s enough of the sheet to fold under on the sides and end of the bed. Check that the top edge of your top sheet is aligned with the top of your mattress. Fold the bottom of your top sheet underneath your bedding. Do hospital corners with the sides of your flat sheet (see instructions below). How to Do Hospital Corners Hospital corners are a type of flat sheet fold that makes your bedding look crisp and neat. Here’s how to fold them perfectly. Fold the end of the top sheet under the end of your mattress — the sides should still be hanging loose. Grab a piece of the top sheet one to two feet away from the end of the bed. Lift this piece up at a 45-degree angle from the corner of the mattress. Lay this piece on top of your mattress, it should make a triangular shape at the foot of your bed. Hold this piece in place, and tuck the excess sheet under your mattress. Try to make sure the excess sheet is tucked neatly, rather than crammed underneath for best results. Let the triangle-shaped section down and tuck any edges that hang below your bed underneath the mattress.","output":"To use a flat sheet, all you need to do is lay the sheet across the bed in the same orientation as the rest of the bedding, center it, and make sure there’s enough sheet to fold under the sides and end of the bed.

Here are three hobby ideas for an introvert who enjoys spending time alone and wants to learn something challenging along with an explanation for why you might enjoy each recommendation: 1. Cooking. Learning to cook is a useful hobby for anyone, but it's especially well suited for an introvert as it's one that can be done entirely alone. It's also a great hobby for someone looking for a creative challenge as it can take months or even years to master fairly simple dishes and even then, there are an endless array of techniques and cuisines to learn. As someone who enjoys spending time alone and wants a challenge, cooking might just be the perfect hobby for you. 2. Chess. Although chess does involve another player, these days it is extremely easy to find opponents online, through apps, or you can even play against a computer, which makes this a suitable hobby for an introvert. One of the most challenging strategy games ever devised, chess is also perfect for someone who enjoys a mental test that will certainly help keep their mind active for hours on end. 3. Running. If you want to spend time outside, but still avoid talking to other people, consider taking up running as a hobby. Not only are there obvious health benefits to this activity, but many runners point to a \\"runner's high\\" where your body releases endorphins that make you feel good after a run. As someone who enjoys a challenge, you should also note that running can be a useful way to develop both your mental and physical stamina as you train yourself to run faster and longer over time.

Ronan is a Borderdoodle, which is a perfect hybrid breed that combines the best traits of Border Collies and Poodles. The Border Collie is known for its intelligence and herding skills, while the Poodle is known for its intelligence, hypoallergenic coat, and affectionate personality. When you combine these two breeds, the result is a dog that is not only trainable and brilliant but also loving and loyal to its humans. Ronan has been with me for about 2 months now, and I couldn't be more excited and grateful to be his momma. I am an avid dog lover that loves to train dogs to be the best versions of themselves. I've also always wanted to share my experiences and adventures with my best friend in the world. When I finally decided to adopt another dog, I spent much time researching breeds and looking for the perfect match for my family. I have had Border Collie mixes before but have struggled with some allergies related to their fur. That's when I discovered the Borderdoodle breed and fell in love with their intelligence, loving nature, and more hypoallergenic coat. But my Ronan is not just any Borderdoodle. He's a special dog with a unique personality all his own. From the moment I laid eyes on him, I knew he was the perfect companion for me. He is so smart, playful, extremely loving, and always eager to please. Whether we're exploring nature or cuddling on the couch, Ronan has become my perfect sidekick. In this blog, I will share our life, from the challenges of training a new puppy to the joys of exploring new places together. Eventually, I will share Ronan's training experiences as he becomes a service dog. I hope sharing our experience with other dog lovers out there inspires some to consider adopting or rescuing a Borderdoodle of their own. I also hope to provide a platform for other Borderdoodle owners to connect and share their own stories. So, join us on our adventures and get to know Ronan. I know you will love him too!"},{"instruction":"After marrying into another royal family, write a dialogue where the queen catches the unhappy princess trying to escape out the window.

He wasn't particularly generous, and never really participated in community events organized in his town. One day, as was his habit, he went through his morning and then headed to the business. However, he wouldn't live to reach the business. While crossing the road, a speeding car hit him, and he died on the spot. People rushed to the scene, hoping to find him alive, but he was gone.

Most of them have roller skating experience through their physical education classes. What are some group games that we could play on the rink that will hold their attention and break up the long skating session?","output":"Here are some group roller skating games that can be used for a group of intermediate-level skaters in the middle school age group: * The Four Corner Game: The Four Corner game doesn't require any skating experience and is mostly a matter of luck. When the music plays, the skaters travel around the rink like normal. When the music stops, they find a corner. A designated dice roller will roll the large fuzzy die, and whichever corner number is rolled is removed from the game. This process of elimination continues until only one player is left and they are declared the winner. There are variations that can be used, such as playing odd/even corners or keeping the number that is rolled rather than eliminating that corner, which speeds up the game significantly. * Rockin' Robin (or the Record Game): This game is for skaters of intermediate skill. The DJ will play the songs \\"Rockin' Robin\\" or \\"You Spin Me Round\\" and blow the whistle throughout the song. When the whistle blows, skaters must turn and skate in the opposite direction. The whistle strikes may be fast and challenging, resulting in skaters making a complete circle. Skaters must pay close attention to the whistles. * Shoot the Duck: This game is played in teams, either red vs. blue or girls vs. boys. When the DJ blows the whistle, students must assume a squatting position on their skates and cannot use their legs to gain speed. As skaters lose momentum, they will stop moving and sit on their bottom. The goal is to be the last skater moving in order to earn a point for their team. The first team to five points wins the opportunity to skate one song all by themselves. * Dodgeball: For advanced skaters, adults/teachers/employees can throw the balls while students skate around the rink and \\"dodge\\" the balls. If a skater is \\"hit,\\" they must sit in the middle of the floor. The goal is to be the last skater standing. If a skater catches the ball, the adult must sit down, instead. Adults should begin by throwing the balls high, so they can be easily ducked under, but aim progressively lower as the song continues. These games are competitive or involve silly movements that are sure to keep skaters engaged. Longer games such as dodgeball can be played during large skating blocks, while it's easier to fit Rockin' Robin and short rounds of The Four Corner Game in between other activities."},{"instruction":"Generate a short article on Spam and its history in feeding the US military. Refer to previous ration systems in use by the US military and discuss modern-day effects of spam as a military ration.","output":"\\"In Defense of Spam\\" Spam has had a much-maligned place in pop culture. From pejorative names such as monkey meat or mystery meat to the many songs soldiers have written to denounce its salty, uniform, partially jellified consistency, Spam has rarely been described with particular fondness. This is particularly true in the United States, the country of its origin. But did you know that Spam played a vital role in the war effort? As a calorie and protein-dense foodstuff that could be shipped overseas in durable cans, Spam was an obvious asset to military planners. Spam tins fed allies in Britain, North Africa, and on the Eastern Front, where millions of cans were shipped to the Soviet Union under lend-lease. For starving populations, it was a dense can of life-saving meat, and the great industrial engine of the United States could produce them in heroic quantities. Perhaps too heroic, however. While Spam was certainly an improvement over the bully beef and salt pork that had fed previous generations of soldiers, the Army's reliance on it grew monotonous to many soldier's palates. Spam tins were happily traded off to civilians wherever soldiers were stationed, or even given away freely or discarded. A side effect of this is the creation of dishes such as Budae-jjigae, a Korean stew that had its origins around US Army bases. Korea, ravaged by war, was in short supply of food. In particular short supply was meat, and Spam filled the gap for many Koreans just as it had for the populations of Europe during WW2. Spam may not have been gourmet, but it was a standby that served its purpose faithfully for people in dire circumstances across the world."},{"instruction":"Finish the following prompt in 300 words or less, making it into an apocalyptic story. \\"He didn't want to go out on such a night but...\\"","output":"He didn't want to go out on such a night, but with their food supply running low, he had no choice.

Humans could safely travel from one safe house to another or venture out for supplies as long as it was dark. Quietly, though. The creatures still had ears. The rain pelted harder on the metal roof, a repeated pinging that hadn't ceased for several hours. It would be muddy, impossible to see, and miserable to trek on foot, but they needed the food. The house was near invisible as he ventured out through the front door. It's funny how dark everything becomes when you no longer have electricity. Not that they could have used it, anyway; the Intruders would have used the light as a beacon to find their hiding spots.

The match between Riggs and King had a primetime television audience. In the U.S., 50 million people tuned in, and worldwide, 90 million viewers watched the September 20, 1973 match, which took place in the Houston Astrodome. Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs in straight sets and earned the winner-take-all prize of 100,000. After the match, Billie Jean King said, \\"I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn’t win that match. It would ruin the women’s [tennis] tour and affect all women’s self-esteem.

I could buy a car. I could buy a mansion! As the delivery man left the house, I settled on what I would buy first. I walked out the door and drove straight to the local pet shop. The cashier greeted me with a hello as I walked in. I waved back at them while scanning for what I wanted. There were so many pets, from dogs & cats to snakes, bunnies, and guinea pigs. I was intrigued by all of them. But they were not what I was looking for. Then like a flash of lightning, the perfect pet appeared in front of me. It was like love at first sight. The shine of their green, rough shell. Their eyes looked like black dots glazed over. It was the perfect pet. A turtle. I motion to the staff that I wanted the turtle. They taught me all about turtles and what to look out for. The cashier checked me out and congratulated me on my new pet.

When she had opened their bedroom door, which she kept locked by a hook-and-eye on the outside, she had seen that the beds had been slept in but Eddie Jr, aged five, and his four-year-old sister Alice (nicknamed Missy) were gone. The casement window was PM cranked open about 75 degrees; Alice remembered having closed it the night before because there was a hole in the screen and she wanted to keep the bugs out. The screen was later found outside, leaning against the wall beneath the window, and nearby was a “porter’s stroller”—a converted baby-carriage with a box on it. Alice’s husband, an airplane mechanic who worked nights, protested that he knew nothing of the children’s whereabouts and, alarmed by the message, said he would come right over to see her. Alice and the children lived in a dispiriting redbrick apartment complex flatteringly named Regal Gardens, located near the campus of Queens College in the Kew Gardens Hills section of the New York City borough of Queens. Shortly after joining his wife, Eddie called the police, and the first contingent of patrolmen were on the scene in a matter of minutes. By 11 a.m. precinct cars were parked all around the grassy mall adjoining Alice’s apartment building at 150— 22 72nd Drive.","output":"Eddie Crimmins was accused by his estranged wife of abducting their children from her home.

There was a takeout place back home called Wong's my folks and I patronized from time to time but they didn't have any seats or nothing. Still, I saw Chang wave me over the moment I walked in so at least I got the address right. I asked him about what he'd seen back at the warehouse on Thursday but he waved me off. Something about leaving business until after dinner. My curiosity was still burning in my mind about what he'd seen, but I figured I could eat. Soon a large plate of mixed vegetables and beef was placed before me. I'd have happily dug in right then and there, but they didn't give me a spoon or fork! Just two sticks to my side. I looked at Chang with confusion, and he just nodded and said \\"chopsticks\\", as if that was all I needed to know. I politely excused myself to the restroom. When I came back, I saw Chang with his own pair of sticks somehow perched between his fingers. I had no idea how but he was deftly eating with one hand and chatting with the waiter at the same time. In my pocket, I tried to mimic the same hand position as I made my way back to the seat. I didn't want Chang to think I was some sort of palooka. For the rest of the meal, I kept an eye on Chang, thankful he and the waiter seemed to know each other.

Give me at least a paragraph on three different style changes. Make sure one of the paragraphs is about innovations in undergarments.","output":"At the Tudor court, small, flat-fronted waists leading to full breasts pressed down by the square-necked gown were all the rage. How was that achieved? In short, it was the use of busks that produced the silhouette and structure of the upper part of gowns. A busk could be made out of wood, bone, or sometimes metal. During the Tudor period, these flat inserts became more and more ornamental. They could be etched with personal messages or swirls of branching flora. These busks were the first step toward the corset we would later become so familiar with, providing rigidity and forcing good posture that advertised to the world that a woman was high-born. One very important piece of underwear was the \\"bum roll.\\" Showing up for the first time in the 1500s, this stuffed tube of fabric was tied around the lower portion of a lady's waist to increase her hip circumference and the amount of fabric she could wear on her skirts. Since silks and brocades were the going materials of the day and deeply exclusive because of cost, the more fabric worn translated into more wealth a wearer was likely to have. These bum rolls allowed for wide swathes of skirts, more pleats, and flounces. These undergarments also helped the women to bear some of the weight of their heavy skirts without it sitting directly on their hip bones. Tudor fashion was more about statement than comfort. Like busks, bum rolls were essentially shapewear, modifying the female silhouette to what was considered ideal at the time. One of the most important pieces of jewelry a woman of this period may have owned would have been her girdle belt. This was a long string, often of silver or gold and embellished with gems, that highlighted a woman's small waist and hung downward. Some women wore a pomander ball at the end of their girdle belts for when the city air got especially ripe. Others, like Anne Boleyn, used it to carry small prayer books about with them. Katherine of Aragon was even known to clutch the girdle belt of her patron saint while in childbirth, though this doesn't seem to have provided her with any luck. There are portraits of Kaherine herself in an immense string of pearls girdle belt that matches her royal necklaces. One of Jane Seymour, Henry's third wife, shows a girdle belt with a pattern of pearls and red gems that leads to a very large oval stone set in gold at the end."},{"instruction":"Write a recipe for tzatziki sauce from the perspective of someone who’s passionate about cooking and values specific, personal touches such as crushing fresh garlic into a paste instead of using garlic powder or minced garlic.","output":"Tzatziki has a tangy, yet refreshing taste that’s as versatile as it is delicious, but homemade will always beat storebought.

Collaborative learning arms pupils with the confidence to teach and learn from their peers and teachers, too. In primary schools especially, collaborative learning will help develop soft skills at an earlier age, helping children become more effective communicators.

In a year, the globe drinks around 400 billion cups of coffee every year. Many methods for brewing coffee have been developed around the world and each comes with its own benefits. Some of them include: - Pour over: A dripper is lined with a paper filter and filled with coffee grounds before hot water is poured over the grounds, then coffee drips down into the cup below. The paper filter helps trap the oils and grounds giving the final cup a clarified mouth feel. - Coffee Makers: Popular in much of the world, coffee makers are similar to a dripper but are automated with a water reservoir that heats the water before it hits the coffee grounds. Similar to the pour-over method it utilizes a paper or reusable filter that gives the coffee a clarified mouth feel. - French Press: An immersion method of brewing coffee in which the grounds are fully immersed in hot water before a metal filter is used to separate the grounds from the liquid. This method allows oils and small undissolved coffee particles into the cup giving a unique flavor. - Cold Brew: Another immersion method in which grounds sit in room temperature water for 8-12 hours before being poured through a filter.

Make it just a little bit too wordy, like it's a kid who just learned about philosophy and is trying to make everything super deep.","output":"In order to understand the importance of kindness, you first have to understand what kindness *is*. It's not just saying nice words and smiling, though that is part of it. No, kindness is much deeper. It's looking at another person in need and feeling that need yourself, then doing whatever it takes to fill that need. It's empathy expressed as you help others with love in your heart for them. Every person, no matter who they are, deserves the kindness of others. To give them any less is to treat them like they're not human. Just showing kindness to others is an affirmation of our shared humanity. That's why it's important to show respect to others and to help where we can. This is how we develop compassion for the people around us. True kindness expects nothing in return for its actions. Instead, what you get from kindness is the joy of helping others, the warm feeling in your heart when you know you've made someone's day better. The most difficult acts of kindness often come when we're having a bad day ourselves. These are the times when kindness to others is most important because these are the times when it doesn't come naturally. Choosing to stop and consider what others might be going through before speaking or acting can save you from arguments, frustration, and anger, and it can be incredibly meaningful to the other person. A lot of people act like kindness is easy, but they're completely misunderstanding what it is. True kindness takes a lot of courage because it often involves doing the right thing even if it's hard or you don't want to. Selflessness is the kind of thing you have to work for; you don't just stumble into it. I believe that kindness has the power to change the world. Let's all be kind to one another.

My guests were planning to come and do lots of hiking in nature, but the forecast now says it will be raining most of the time they’re here.","output":"No problem! Here are some fun things to do in Santa Fe that don’t require good weather conditions. *Visit museums - There are lots of great museums to check out in Santa Fe. Take your guests to Meow Wolf to explore interactive, psychedelic exhibits crafted by local artists and funded by author George RR Martin, or bring them to see the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the New Mexico History Museum, or the Museum of International Folk Art. *Grab a bite - Santa Fe has excellent restaurants, whether you’re looking for a tasty casual meal or a fine dining experience. CHOMP is an upscale food court hosting 4-5 popup restaurants, a bar, a dance floor, and a play area for kids. Plaza Cafe is a retro diner-style eatery serving breakfast all day as well as dinner, drinks, and desserts. Radish & Rye offers delicious upscale farm-to-table cuisine. Geronimo on Canyon Road is considered one of the best fine-dining restaurants in the country. Countless other restaurants in the area are sure to satisfy your guests’ cravings and curiosities. *10,000 Waves - While this famed spa is known for its beautiful scenery and outdoor hot tubs, the facility is designed to make hot tub bathing pleasant through rain, sleet, or snow. The spa also offers indoor massage and spa treatments, as well as fine dining and luxury lodging accommodations, so there’s plenty to do here, even if an outdoor soak is off the menu. *Violet Crown Cinema - The Railyard district in Santa Fe is often recommended for its outdoor concerts and easy walking, but there are a few indoor attractions worth visiting. Violet Crown Cinema is one of them. This movie theater has standard concessions, a full kitchen menu, and a bar serving wine and beer. You can dine in the lounge or take your food and drinks into the theaters. After the movie, you can walk less than 2 blocks to an indie bookstore, ice cream shop, pizza parlor, coffee shop, brewery, and boutique shopping *Sky Railway - Just around the corner from Violet Crown Cinema, you’ll find the Jean Cocteau, a small, historic indie theater revived by author George R.R. Martin. The novelist and patron of Santa Fe’s art scene also revived a dilapidated historical railroad line to create a luxe travel experience with Sky Railway. The train cars are outfitted in an antique style with food, drinks, and entertainment offered on board while the train travels right through the heart of Santa Fe’s Railyard district, as well as into more scenic surrounding areas. *Tumbleroot - If your guests enjoy music, they might like to catch a show at Tumbleroot Brewery and Distillery. This spot has excellent quality drinks, diverse musical acts, a large dance floor, a gallery and merch space, and a beautiful outdoor space in the back with food trucks, a bar, and a frog pond. *Shopping - Santa Fe is overflowing with artisans, so the shops on the plaza are always stocked with beautifully crafted and unique pieces. In this area, window shopping is just about as entertaining as a museum visit. Even if your guests don’t end up purchasing anything, they’ll be sure to enjoy browsing."},{"instruction":"How many miles are between Nashville, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois?","output":"There are 473.1 miles between Nashville and Chicago."},{"instruction":"How many hours would it take to travel from Hawaii to Orlando, FL by plane on a nonstop flight?","output":"It would take approximately 11 hours and 32 minutes to travel from Hawaii to Orlando by plane, nonstop."},{"instruction":"What is the price of a ticket to New York City?","output":"I'm sorry, I do not have the knowledge to provide current airfare prices, I can only give you information on the distance from one location to another."},{"instruction":"Write a creative short story about the greatest golfer that ever lived, in rhyming form.","output":"The greatest golfer that ever lived was none other than Barry Yamp.

Put in a numbered list. Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a work (for example, a book, movie, picture, song or website) the right to say how other people can use it. Copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works. It is one part of a group of laws about intellectual property (the others being trademark and patent law). It helps protect authors from other people copying their works without permission and/or for commercial purposes. With copyright, a work can only be copied if the owner gives permission. If someone copies a work without permission, the owner can say they infringed their copyright. When this happens, the owner may sue for the amount that should have been paid. Most cases are handled by civil law. In more serious cases, a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested, fined or even go to prison. Commonly, the copyright law will protect the authors and their heirs for 50 to 100 years since the author's death, or the first day of multiple authors' deaths. Many countries have modified their copyright law to meet international standards. However, there are still differences in national laws. In some countries, someone violating copyright law will be sued only to the civil law courts but other countries they can also be charged by criminal courts.","output":"1.

Mack was spotted by tourists viewing the pyramids and they alerted the local authorities. Mack tried to escape, but this time he was captured by the authorities with a net. He was sold to an unloving circus owner, who put Mack on a ship that sailed for London. Arriving in London, Mack was placed into a circus with other exotic animals.

One day, a wealthy English lord who owned an estate outside of London came to the circus and was alarmed by the treatment of the animals in the circus. Using a portion of his wealth, he paid the circus owner for all of the animals in the circus, including Mack.

Larry fell out of bed every morning, but that did not stop him from doing what he had to do. Larry lived with his friend, Peter. Peter often had trouble paying attention to one thing for very long, but he was extremely fast. Peter could race around the field and bring food back into his hole in minutes. One day while Larry and Peter were out in the field looking for food, Peter got frustrated at Larry for being too slow, and occasionally dropping some food behind him as they moved through the field. Larry was offended and told Peter that he could easily make it across the field faster than him. Peter accepted his challenge and the two rats discussed a starting and endpoint for the race. Once ready, they lined up at the starting line and got Mr. Raven to say \\"3, 2, 1, GO!\\" Peter left Larry in a cloud of dust as he sprinted forward. Larry tripped and fell, but he got right back up and kept going. After a while, Peter looked behind him and didn't see Larry, so he kept going until he came across a pond. It was exceedingly hot outside and Peter knew he had time for a swim, so he got in and splashed around for a while. Meanwhile, Larry was still steadily racing toward the finish line. He had quietly passed Peter and kept moving forward. Larry looked behind him and saw Peter sprinting behind him. This startled him, and he lost his footing once again. Peter surpassed him and made sure that he couldn't see him anymore. Peter then came across his favorite snack, a fresh strawberry. He could not resist as he went off the path and indulged in the fruit. Larry had once again caught up to Peter, and the finish line was in sight.

Lower your car costs Refinancing your auto loan and taking advantage of lower interest rates could save you considerably over the life of your loan. Shopping around for car insurance regularly can also help you cut costs compared with simply letting your current policy auto-renew. You can cut ongoing car maintenance costs by driving less, removing heavy items from your trunk and avoiding unnecessary rapid acceleration. 11. Reduce your gas usage You can't control prices at the pump, but you can do several things to cut your gas use and save money. Try using a gas app to pinch pennies when you do fill up. 12. Bundle cable and internet You could lower your cable bill by as much as 40 per month by changing your cable package. And you could save more than 1,000 over two years by bundling your cable and internet service, depending on your carrier. Another option to consider is cutting cable or at least cutting some of your additional streaming services or premium subscriptions. 13. Switch your cell phone plan Changing your plan is one way to save money on your cell phone bill, but it’s not the only way. Removing insurance from your plan could save you nearly 100 per year, per line. Signing up for autopay and paperless statements can save you an additional 5 to 10 per month, per line.

How many students participated in the walkouts? 2. What was the reason for the walkouts? 3. What was the average class size? 4. What was the average student-to-counselor ratio? In the early days of March 1968, as many as 22,000 mostly Mexican American students walked out of their classrooms at seven Los Angeles schools, garnering national attention. The unprecedented event spotlighted educational inequality, galvanized the Chicano civil rights movement and inspired a new generation of activists, artists, educators and elected officials. The schools involved served the Mexican barrios of the city’s Eastside neighborhoods, or East Los Angeles, where Chicanos or Mexican Americans made up about 75 percent (130,000) of the student population. Students protested the vast educational inequality they faced: schools that were run down and understaffed, teachers that were overworked and undertrained. Class size averaged around 40 and the student-to-counselor ratio was 4,000-to-1, according to the United Way of Los Angeles. Students also complained they were being steered toward vocational and domestic training, instead of academic courses that would help them get into college. Early 1968 was a time of deep civil unrest in the U.S., rife with antiwar and civil rights protests. Aware of these and other parallel social movements taking place in the country and around the world, Chicanos demanded that their language, history and culture be reflected in their schools’ curriculum. Historians point to the East L.A. walkouts as the first time the Chicano movement moved from the rural setting of the United Farm Workers’ strikes of 1965 to an urban setting. The Blowouts, as they are also known, also marked the movement’s first major youth-led protest. “This time, it was the youth who said, unh-uh,” says Valerie Talavera-Bustillos, professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Los Angeles. “That really made people stop and think, ‘Oh yeah, these kids are right. We don’t have to accept [the school conditions].’ It was a turning point.”","output":"1. Almost 22,000 mostly Mexican American students participated in the walkout. 2.

Here’s a list of classic love songs for your rehearsal dinner with their release years for easy reference: 1. “The Way You Look Tonight” by Frank Sinatra (1964) - This classic song has been performed by several artists, but Frank Sinatra’s version is widely considered the most popular. 2. “L-O-V-E” by Nat King Cole (1965) - Nat King Cole’s smooth and mellow voice is great for background music, and while this song may inspire some guests to hit the dancefloor, its tempo should keep the dancing fairly tame. 3. “Crazy Love” by Van Morrison (1970) - This song has been covered by several artists and appeared on the soundtrack to a number of popular films. 4. “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” by Stevie Wonder (1972) - With its romantic lyrics and upbeat sound, this classic song will be sure to put your guests in a great mood. 5. “Going to the Chapel” by the Dixie Cups (1964) - It’s hard to imagine a song with lyrics better suited to this occasion. 6. “I Say a Little Prayer” by Dionne Warwick (1967) - While this romantic classic may not be a big hit on the dancefloor after being featured in a rehearsal dinner scene in the film ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding,’ it might inspire your guests to burst into song at the dinner table. 7. “At Last” by Etta James (1960) - This classic is a popular pick for a couple’s first dance at their wedding reception, with timeless lyrics and a moving, emotional performance by Etta James. 8. “Be My Baby” by the Ronettes (1963) - The lyrics of this song hold promises for a wonderful relationship. It has appeared on many “Best of the 1960s” lists and is considered by some to be among the greatest songs of all time. 9. “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” by Frankie Valli (1967) - This song was so popular, it earned Frankie Valli a Gold Record. It’s been covered by artists all over the world and appeared in lots of popular movie and television soundtracks. 10. “Love is Here to Stay” by Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong (1957) - This hit, composed by George Gershwin, has been covered by countless artists, but nothing says romance like a duet performed by jazz icons Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong."},{"instruction":"Create a blog post about the importance of seeking treatment for a suspected dental abscess. Assume that the person asking isn't sure what's causing their toothache and they're wondering just how serious it might be, or if it's a true emergency/","output":"Gradually worsening toothache pain can be more than discomforting. As this continues to progress you might also notice a building pain and pressure deep within your gums. This is a distinct sign that you need to seek timely treatment from a dentist or some other type of oral care specialist. Untreated tooth decay can do more than hamper the basic function of your mouth and cause problems with sensitivity. In time the bacterial presence can invade the core structures of a tooth causing an infection in the root and surrounding gum tissues. Symptoms of a dental abscess that needs emergency treatment include: - An intense or throbbing toothache - Pain in your gums - Redness inside the mouth around the tooth - Redness outside the mouth on the face or jaw - Sensitivity to hot or cold food and drinks - A foul taste in your mouth. - Trouble opening your mouth - Being unable to chew food in that part of your mouth - Swelling in your face or on your jaw - A fever If the problem is caught early a dentist might be able to treat the tooth by performing a root canal to extract the infected part of the root and drain any fluid. This treatment will likely include a follow-up course of prescription antibiotics to clear up any residual infection. If the dental abscess is severe, the dentist might need to drain the bacterial fluid and completely extract the tooth to prevent bacteria from passing from the abscess to your bloodstream. Sometimes a dental implant can be placed after the extraction. Though most oral care experts prefer to wait until the infection and inflammation have gone down. If the tooth cannot be viably treated and a treatment-based extraction the dentist will likely provide you with a prescription for pain medication along with antibiotics. Once everything is fully healed and all infection concerns have passed, you can explore your dental restoration options. Many people who lose a tooth to a dental abscess will choose a dental implant over a partial or single-tooth denture."},{"instruction":"Write a song that expresses the depth of a father's love for his daughter.

In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theatre. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event.[44] The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \\"ghost house\\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. At one point he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a penknife and, holding it in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the six-inch key.[45] Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. At the time, Houdini said it had been one of the most difficult escapes of his career.[46] After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, admitting that Houdini was tested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was six inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.[47] James Randi believes that the only way the handcuffs could have been opened was by using their key, and speculates that it would have been viewed \\"distasteful\\" to both the Mirror and to Houdini if Houdini had failed the escape.[20]: 165 This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.[48] A full-sized construction of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for them, are on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.[49][50] This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.[51]","output":"A newspaper challenged a magician to escape from special handcuffs.

Rows of aisles, big and bold, With shelves so high, stories untold. We wander through this cavernous space, Our shopping carts, we do embrace. Amidst the bustle, a scent so sweet, The sample stops, a tempting treat. One, then another, a whole bunch, These samples make a tapas lunch. Bulk-sized goods fill up our hands, Our cart (and bill) quickly expands. A two pound 2 pack of some chips A 60-pack of chicken strips. Endless choices at every turn, And cash back savings we can earn. The benefits you get to live, When you're a Costco executive We're all checked out, we have our load And grabbed a hot dog for the road.

Can we start our discussion with a short paragraph of 5 sentences?","output":"The two main types of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised models. Supervised models have a target variable they are attempting to build a model around. For example, there are binary classification models that attempt to denote a specific variable either true or not. In unsupervised learning methods, there is no distinction between what variable is the most important. Clustering is a good example, where different instances are grouped but not necessarily for the same reasons."},{"instruction":"Rewrite Macbeth Act 1, Scene 7 into modern English.","output":"Macbeth: If I'm going to kill the king, it's better that I do it quickly and all the better for it. If the killing of the man would kill any chance of retaliation and guilt, the better. That strike could be the be-all and end-all, but if it's not, we risk our souls. If I'm wrong, there will be consequences here and now, and not just spiritual consequences. We, who teach messy and bloody lessons, risk being taught messy and bloody lessons in our own turn, eh? That's the natural consequence, and it returns a poisoned cup back to our own mouths. After all, the king is here and trusts me twice as much--he's my king and my cousin, and he's my guest, so I should protect him from murderers, not do the murdering myself! Although he's been such a top-notch king that if he was to die, then his good deeds would pretty much guarantee his way into heaven. So there's that. Lady Macbeth: Oh, hey, why are you acting weird and stuff? Macbeth: Look, honestly, this has gone way too far. We're leaving it right there. The king has given me a bunch of stuff lately, and everyone thinks I'm a pretty good guy. Why would I mess that all up just when things are going so well? Lady Macbeth: Oh, you must have been drinking, then, when you were like, 'Oh, I'm gonna' kill the king'. It's like your resolve went to sleep and woke up pale and sickly now. I guess that's how you treat your oaths, so that must be how you love, too. Are you scared to rise and grind? Are you afraid to take what you deserve? I guess you'd rather live as a coward than do what you said you would. Macbeth: Ugh, please. I do everything that any man dares, and a greedy man is not a man at all, man. Lady Macbeth: You used to be cool, Macbeth. Now you're just lame. So lame. Just do it, don't be a scaredy cat. Macbeth: And what happens when Duncan catches us and peels our skin off? Lady Macbeth: Then he catches up and peels our skin off.

Just as he did back then, the old man sat in the back pew of the church. The man was dressed entirely in black, suitable attire for Mary's funeral, and held a large black suitcase in his hands. As the pastor droned on in his Sermon about the shortness of life and the forgiveness of God, the old man barely seemed to move. Jake turned back around to face the front, dismissing the old man, his eyes lingering on the framed photo of his sister next to her closed casket. It was dreadful enough to have to bury your sister when she was only 35 but for her to have died in such a manner - shivers crept up his spine and he gave a slight shrug to hide it. The detective sitting next to him gave him a sideways look. Matthew had been the one to suggest that his sister's killer may make a reappearance at the public funeral and volunteered to sit beside Jake during the ceremony. Cameras had been placed strategically around the church in an attempt to capture the image of everyone in attendance. Later, Jake would wonder if he had imagined the old man -- if he had been a coping mechanism of sorts that began with his mother's similarly traumatizing murder those five years ago because as Matthew reviewed the camera footage from the funeral, there was no capture of that man at all."},{"instruction":"Write me a paragraph for an article about Yadier Molina. The paragraph should be between 150-250 words.","output":"Yadier Molina is one of Major League Baseball's all-time greatest catchers. The 9-time gold glove winner is considered by many to be the greatest defensive catcher in the history of baseball. Prior to free agency, Molina stated that if the right offer didn't come along he would consider retiring from baseball as a whole. Molina's retirement would be a significant one for the St. Louis Cardinals as well as baseball as a whole. Molina has played all 17 years of his career with the Cardinals. Playing that long with one team is a rarity nowadays, especially at a position as physically demanding as a catcher. Drafted in 2000, the now 38-year-old Molina has amassed 160 homers across over 2,000 regular season games. Batting at a very effective .280 clip, Yadier Molina has been selected to 9 all-star games in his career and won two World Series trophies. Although he's slowed down at the plate, Molina is still one of the top defensive catchers in the entire league.

Write in a Shakespearian tone. Capitalize each word \\"She's so lucky, she's a star.\\" — Britney Spears...and Gen Z all over TikTok. If your FYP hasn't picked it up yet, we're talking about the latest trend Lucky Girl Syndrome — a new way to manifest good fortune in your life. But does it actually work for everyone? What is Lucky Girl Syndrome? Lucky Girl Syndrome is the idea that as long as you believe that things in life will go your way, they will. Think: You believe you'll come into money, and you do. You believe that cars will get out of your way so you can merge onto the freeway, and they move. You believe you'll be invited to New York Fashion Week, and you are. If you took psych 101, you might recognize this as the law of assumption: That everything you believe to be true will, in reality, become true. Or maybe you've heard it called manifesting. Or \\"The Secret.\\" In any case, it's the idea that so long as you believe that you attract luck, the odds will be ever in your favor. Here's one example, which went viral on TIkTok: Two friends wanted certain rooms in their apartment — but they didn't want to ask their other roommates for the rooms. And they knew that things don't always work out in their favor. So they decided to start manifesting the concept that \\"everything works out for us.\\" Turns out, the other roommates offered the two friends the rooms they wanted. Moral of the story: Think positive. But not everyone can just make their own luck...can they? Well, it might not be all about luck. A quick review of your FYP might confirm that all the ‘lucky girls’ fit perfectly into society’s beauty standards. Most of the TikTokers gushing over Lucky Girl Syndrome are white, thin, and conventionally attractive. Coincidence? Probably not. Sometimes systemic biases can create or block opportunities for some people. Something to be mindful of when you’re thinking of testing this trend out. theSkimm Looking on the bright side and believing that things will work out for you can have a positive impact on your mental health.

Keep it under five paragraphs.","output":"Just two weeks ago, Peter, a baby bird, made his grand entrance into the world. After being nurtured by his mother and father, it was almost time for Peter to venture out of the nest. The world outside the nest was unchartered territory, and Peter was anxious about making the jump. Peter's parents started nudging him and his siblings toward the edge of the nest, so they can get a better view of the world. It was a beautiful place, but there were so many noises and things moving around. To say it was daunting would be an understatement. But, Peter was intrigued. One by one, Peter's siblings made the venture outside the nest. They would come back to visit a few times a day. They told him that the world was a great place and that they were having so much fun exploring. Peter decided it was time to be brave and join his parents and siblings outside the nest. He slowly stepped to the very edge. However, upon looking down he realized just how high up he was. He cautiously moved back into the center of the nest. His mother and father saw this and decided to head to the nest. They assured him that they would be there to help. Peter agreed to give it a go. Back on the edge, he began flapping his wings. He took a deep breath and made the daring jump. Much to his surprise, he was flying with ease. Peter saw his parents and siblings foraging around in some grass just below the tree he was in. He swooped down with ease to join them. He was delighted to see that they were in an area with abundant flying insects. With one quick jump, he caught an insect. He was so proud to be able to catch his own meals.

Is there any validity to these thoughts? Please address the top concerns of having and using microwaves and explain why those claims are or are not true.","output":"Microwaves are very powerful pieces of equipment, capable of heating food to over 200 degrees Fahrenheit and emitting 2000 watts of electricity. They do have a controversy on whether they are entirely safe to be using or not. Do they cause cancer? Do they make food less nutrient-rich? Are they safe for heating water? Microwaves do use radio waves to heat food and emit radiation. However, the type of radiation is non-ionizing and does not have the power to change your DNA, and is not as dangerous as an X-ray. There have been no sustained cases of microwaves causing cancer. Further, the FDA monitors the amount of radiation that manufacturers are allowed to have leaked from microwaves and it is minuscule. If your microwave is in disrepair the amount could be higher so it's best to replace them. It is also advised that people do not stand directly in front of microwaves while in use. Making a cup of boiling water in the microwave might be more of a hazard than you think. If you are looking for a quick way to boil water it might be best to think again before popping it in the microwave. By doing so, the water can be superheated and when disturbed can erupt. The water may seem innocuous enough, but add in some instant coffee, stir it, or drop in a teabag and the water can suddenly, violently boil over. This has led to severe burns. Superheating occurs when liquids are quickly heated much past their boiling point. This makes it so that the liquid does not have time to release the steam. Watch out for this as it can cause injury. It has been thought that microwaving foods cause them to lose their nutritional value. This has been thought because people who regularly use the microwave are generally less healthy than those that do so less often. Correlation does not equal causation in this case though. It seems that in general the health of those using the microwave is less because they are picking foods that are marketed for the microwave. These foods often have less nutritional value. When cooked in the microwave versus the stove food was found to have retained more nutritional value because it was cooked for a shorter period. Overall, take general precautions, use common sense and the microwave should be pretty safe."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this love letter as a breakup letter.

While many dogs end up loving spending time in their crates as they feel it is their safe space, if you don’t do it right, they could end up hating it! So, to crate train your dog, here’s what you need to do: - When you bring the crate home, put it in a room where your dog feels comfortable, like your bedroom or living room. - Take one of their favorite blankets or pillows and put it inside. - Leave the door open for at least one day but don’t encourage the dog to get in. - Show your dog the crate and let it sniff around the outside. - Put your dog's favorite treat or a small bowl of food inside. - Let the dog get in to get the treat and then get out without shutting the door. - Keep this practice for a few days; continually allow your dog to get in to get the treat and then get out when they want to. - After 3 or 4 times, place the treat in the crate, and then when the dog gets in, shut the door. - Sit next to the crate, telling the dog they’re a “good dog.” - After a few minutes, let them out again. - Keep up this practice, prolonging how long the dog stays inside the crate until they seem comfortable. The main objective is to make sure your dog doesn’t think the crate is a punishment but a place to relax. It's important that they know no matter how long they’re in there, you will always let them out."},{"instruction":"I'm trying to come up with some creative podcast names.

After typing in one last figure and hitting 'enter' she was finished. Denise rubbed her eyes, stretched, and powered down her computer. One look out the window told her that the wind outside had picked up since lunchtime. So, she put on her coat before grabbing her purse and heading for the door. She pushed the metal handle inward, but instead of swinging wide like it usually did, the door didn't budge. Denise was so used to having it fly open that she almost ran right into it when it didn't budge. She tried pushing it in again. The bolt didn't slide away from the frame.

To work around this, you can start photographing at smaller venues hosting live music including coffee shops or bars that might have less strict photo policies. From there, you can build samples of your work to show the larger professional venues and increase the likelihood of being allowed inside.

Either way, it's helpful to know you have people who are on your side, and you're not alone. 2. Listen to music. I once heard a phrase that resonated with me: \\"When words fail, music speaks.\\" No matter what you're feeling, I can guarantee there's a song that explains the way you feel. Put on your sad song playlist and have a good cry (this seems counter-productive, but I promise you'll feel better afterward), listen to something high-energy and upbeat, or just indulge in your all-time favorites. 3. Treat yourself. Rewarding yourself is a great way to make yourself feel better. Maybe you've been eyeing up a new outfit - don't think twice. You deserve it! 4. Eat something you love. If you're feeling down, food can be a real mood booster. Sometimes a slice of cake or a juicy cheeseburger is just what we need to perk ourselves up a little. 5. Cook or bake. Even if you're not so good at it, cooking or baking something is a fun way to cheer yourself up. Learning a new recipe, or having a loved one over to bake some delicious sweet treats, is a great distraction from stress and sadness. 6. Play a video game. No matter what kind of games you like to play, playing a video game is a great way to cheer yourself up. Maybe you're taking your stress out on some zombies in a shooter or exploring some breathtaking scenery in an open-world adventure. Either way, video games are a great distraction and a mood booster. 7. Spend time with furry friends. Nothing cheers me up more than hanging out with my pup. If you don't have your own 4-legged friend, go visit a family member or friend who does, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about."},{"instruction":"Based on the given list of ingredients, would the recipe be part of the main course or dessert? 4large egg yolks ½cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided ¾cup heavy cream 1cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces) For the Assembly 1¾cups good espresso or very strong coffee 2tablespoons rum or cognac 2tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package) 1 to 2ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)","output":"The chocolate, sugar, and pastries in this recipe make it likely to be a dessert."},{"instruction":"This paragraph has a lot of swear words. Could you rewrite it to make it sound more polite and simple so a 5th grader could understand it? People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply “not give a fuck.” Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like “Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn’t give a fuck.” Or “Did you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck.” Or “Jason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn’t going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck.” Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your life where you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights. I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did it. Everybody just wants to be liked and accepted. Except for Tim. Tim doesn't give a fuck. Now, while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it. The point is, most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about the rude gas station attendant who gave us too many nickels. We give a fuck when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give a fuck when our coworkers don’t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when it’s raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning. Fucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe? This is the problem, my friend. Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, that’s when life fucks us.","output":"People say that you'd have to not care too much to get confidence and success. And that's true because we all think the coolest people are the people who don't let something affect them too much. Susie doesn't let the fact she has to work weekends mess with her mood; Tom doesn't let the stress at work stop him from being himself; Jason doesn't let other people's opinions stop him from walking out from an event he doesn't enjoy. You may know somebody who didn't care about what others thought and did something super cool. Maybe even you did something amazing because you didn't care about what others thought. I know that one of my best moments was when I stopped caring too much and told my boss that I wanted to quit my job because I wanted to sell dating advice. Another of my best moments was selling everything I owned to move to South America. I didn't care too much; I just did it anyway. Everyone in the world wants to be liked and accepted, but there are some people, like Tim, who don't care much about these things. Even though not caring about what others think sounds easy, it's actually a whole chunk of fish and chips in it. I'm not sure what I just said, but I don't really care. But hey, fish and chips are lovely, so let's leave the sentence that way. What I mean is most people care too much all the time, even during times when they shouldn't. We care when someone gives us too many coins. We care when our favorite show gets canceled. We care when our colleagues didn't ask us what we got up to on the weekend. We care when the day we wanted to exercise was a rainy one instead. People care about this, people care about that. Care is everywhere in the world... But why? What is it for? To make yourself feel like you fit in? That's the problem. When we choose to care about everything, we feel like we deserve to be comfortable and happy. That isn't how life works."},{"instruction":"Hi, please turn this into a single paragraph and shorten it to remove unnecessary words. Don't remove facts or change the meaning of the article.

Can you give me a list and explain how to do them?","output":"Here are some exercises you can do to train your legs without needing weights. 1. Squats Squats have long been regarded as the best way to build strong legs and butt. The squat mainly works your quads, glutes, and core but will also work your hamstrings to a lesser extent. To do a squat stand with your feet hip or shoulder width apart in a stable stance. From there, push your hips back as if you were going to sit down. While the hips are moving back, let your knees bend and move down until you feel the strain. Be sure to try and maintain vertical shins throughout the exercise. Once you are at your lowest point, you can begin to push yourself back up to a standing position. You can make this harder by adding a heavy backpack or holding something in each hand so long as the objects are equal in weight. 2. Jump Squat Similar to the standard squat, you can use a jump squat to improve your power and increase the intensity of the exercise. A jump squat will be more beneficial when building your fast-twitch muscle fibers. Performing a jump squat is as easy as it sounds. Start off in a squat position and perform a standard squat. Once you are at your low point, use the power in your legs to jump up and make sure to land softly in the same position you started. Try to maintain form with this exercise. Keeping your legs controlled when jumping will also help to increase core strength. 3. Lunge A lunge requires immense stability as you split your hips in half. A great exercise for your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, a lunge can be done pretty much anywhere. A lunge will also help you work your hip stabilizers as you try to maintain balance. A lunge is done by standing in a normal position with your feet. From here, extend one leg backward until both of your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should not go past your toes. From here, push off with your back leg to regain your original stance. Repeat this for both legs as many times as you wish. 4. Jump Lunge Just as a jump squat increases your fast-twitch muscle fibers, so will a jump lunge. A great exercise for building power in your legs. This exercise is not easy, so be careful when trying it, and ensure you are comfortable with a standard lunge first. To do a Jump lunge, get into a lunge position as you would normally. From the point where your knees are bent, you can now jump up and alternate your legs in the air. This should be performed in a controlled way so that you land softly. 5. Side Lunge A side lunge is similar to a normal lunge but has key differences. Firstly this exercise will work your abductors, glutes, and quads. Working different leg muscles on a lateral plane rather than a linear one is a good exercise. This is important as the range of motion we experience with our legs daily is large. Start off in a standing position. Next, move one leg out to the side. Imagine it's just one leg in a normal squat position. Your knee should be bent but not past your toes. Your other leg should be straight. From here, simply return to standing and alternate the legs as you go. 6. Sumo Squat We've done normal squats, so now here is the sumo squat. The sumo squat pays particular attention to your adductors, glutes, and quads. Start off by standing as a sumo with your legs wider than your shoulders to where it is comfortable. Keep your toes slightly pointed away from your body. From this position, perform a squat as you would usually, and again, be sure that your knee doesn't extend past your foot and that your shin stays as vertical as it can."},{"instruction":"When did the \\"Whiskey Rebellion\\" end?","output":"U.S. federal troops put an end to the \\"Whiskey Rebellion\\" in October of 1794 after distillers in the Appalachian region resisted paying a tax on their distilled spirits.

They dedicate their lives to the pursuit of arcane knowledge and uncovering the secrets of the world. They’re extremely powerful spellcasters and with the right items, they could be unstoppable. Here is a list of five magic items for wizards! 5. Ring of Spell Storing The Ring of Spell Storing is a must-have for wizards, especially low-level wizards. This item allows you to store up to five levels of spells within it to use at a later time. You can even cast the spells and give the ring to another player to use. Low-level players have fewer spell slots, and the spells within the ring are held there indefinitely until they are used. This could be very advantageous for managing spell slots in combat when the chances of a long rest are slim. 4. Arcane Grimoire The Arcane Grimoire can replace a wizard’s standard spellbook and grant bonuses to the spell save DC and attack bonus. Depending on rarity, the bonus can be +1, +2, or +3. It also allows wizards to regain an additional spell slot when they use their arcane recovery feature - which lets them recover a limited amount of spell slots during a short rest. This is a great item because of its spellcasting bonuses, ensuring more of your spells are effective in and out of combat. 3. Rod of Absorption Wizards are very powerful and can wreak havoc on a battlefield. But sadly they don’t tend to fare well when it comes to getting hit. The Rod of Absorption comes in handy to help against spell attacks. A wizard attuned to this item can use their reaction when they’re targeted by a spell that only targets one creature to absorb the energy of the spell. The rod holds 50 charges of spell slots (for example a level 4 spell is equal to 4 charges) and the attuned wizard can then use the energy from within the rod to create more spell slots for themselves. This is an excellent item for wizards with low armor class that would be instantly killed by an upcasted Inflict Wounds. Plus, the bonus spell slots are always useful. 2. Tome of Clear Thought Because wizards are intelligence-based spellcasters, having an item that allows your intelligence maximum to increase can be game-changing. By studying the Tome of Clear thought the character's intelligence score is increased by 2 and so is their intelligence maximum. That means that instead of the 20 cap, players with this item can reach 22. That effectively gives the player an additional +1 to their spellcasting ability. 1 Arch Magi Items (robe or staff) The Robe of the Arch Magi and the Staff of the Magi are two of the most powerful items in the entire game. Both items grant bonuses to the attuned character's spell save DC and attack bonuses, but they also give players access to other spells and bonuses to their armor class. These items are perfect for building a more resilient wizard while also granting a myriad of other bonuses."},{"instruction":"Display the following list rounding the atomic weight to the nearest whole number; only display element name and the weight: Number Symbol Name Atomic Weight (amu, g/mol) 1 H Hydrogen 1.00797 2 He Helium 4.00260 3 Li Lithium 6.941 4 Be Beryllium 9.01218 5 B Boron 10.81 6 C Carbon 12.011 7 N Nitrogen 14.0067 8 O Oxygen 15.9994 9 F Fluorine 18.998403 10 Ne Neon 20.179 11 Na Sodium 22.98977 12 Mg Magnesium 24.305 13 Al Aluminum 26.98154 14 Si Silicon 28.0855 15 P Phosphorus 30.97376 16 S Sulfur 32.06 17 Cl Chlorine 35.453 19 K Potassium 39.0983 18 Ar Argon 39.948 20 Ca Calcium 40.08 Number Symbol Name Atomic Weight (amu, g/mol) 1 H Hydrogen 1.00797 2 He Helium 4.00260 3 Li Lithium 6.941 4 Be Beryllium 9.01218 5 B Boron 10.81 6 C Carbon 12.011 7 N Nitrogen 14.0067 8 O Oxygen 15.9994 9 F Fluorine 18.998403 10 Ne Neon 20.179 11 Na Sodium 22.98977 12 Mg Magnesium 24.305 13 Al Aluminum 26.98154 14 Si Silicon 28.0855 15 P Phosphorus 30.97376 16 S Sulfur 32.06 17 Cl Chlorine 35.453 19 K Potassium 39.0983 18 Ar Argon 39.948 20 Ca Calcium 40.08","output":"Sure here are the elements from your list with their names and rounded atomic weights: Hydrogen - 1 Helium - 4 Lithium - 7 Beryllium - 9 Boron - 11 Carbon - 12 Nitrogen - 14 Oxygen - 16 Fluorine - 19 Neon - 20 Sodium - 23 Magnesium - 24 Aluminum - 27 Silicon - 28 Phosphorus - 31 Sulfur - 32 Chlorine - 35 Potassium - 39 Argon - 40 Calcium - 40"},{"instruction":"Make a list of 5 recommendations for someone visiting Thailand.

The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty. Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English. In 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward.[2] So the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.[3]","output":"- Rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory - Interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty - French King Philip decided to take back English Gascony - English King Edward III tried to claim the French throne by force of arms"},{"instruction":"Write a song that story tells a persons life, from birth to death.

The initial word of the battle came from an Eagle messenger. The invasion's success surprised residents of Minas Tirith, as the 6,000 to 7,000-man expeditionary force attacking the Black Gates was expected to be outnumbered by a factor of at least ten-to-one by orcs and Mordor's human allies. Many military experts considered the attack to be futile. Accounts of the battle remain incomplete, but casualties are heavy, with over a thousand injured and several hundred dead. Orcs were close to overrunning Western positions before the tide of battle turned. How the forces of Mordor were defeated remains unclear. Still, initial reports indicate that the assault on the Black Gate was made in conjunction with the actions of a small team of Halfling saboteurs who were able to infiltrate Mordor and destroy its headquarters at the tower of Barad Dur, possibly with the assistance of some ancient magical artifact. However it was accomplished, numerous eyewitnesses report seeing the tower fall and Mt. Doom erupting. Sauron appears to have perished as the tower collapsed, and his forces broke down in disarray almost immediately. Some observers report that the Ringwraiths turned from the battle and headed back toward Barad Dur just as it broke down, Trolls and other monsters scattered almost immediately, and Mordor's human allies agreed to a truce shortly afterward. The Gondorian military refused to comment on the \\"Hobbit Commandos,\\" however, one source close to royal claimant Aragorn remarked that \\"those little people may not look all that tough, but they do have a knack for covert ops.\\" The victory at the Black Gate ends two weeks of turmoil for Minas Tirith and the Kingdom of Gondor which culminated in a massive battle near the city gates and the suicide of Denethor, Steward of Gondor.

We all have a favorite movie star that we love and it’s not uncommon to daydream of having a life like that person we admire so much. But trying to be just like someone else rarely ever works. We’re all so different. We come from a wide range of backgrounds. Each person’s education, ethnicity, social and financial history is unique. One thing that Hollywood does well is to mask the fact that our favorite movie stars aren’t perfect. This is true in financial and business sectors, publishing, sports, entertainment, and every other industry. It’s hard to find a person who is completely successful in every part of their life. Even Warren Buffett, one of the richest and most influential men in the world, has not had a fully successful personal and married life. That most likely holds true with any successful person you can name. There are always one or two areas where they seem to fail miserably.

A fox trap was set; one fox has already been killed.","output":"It was a warm Saturday evening, shortly before 10 pm and I was out for my evening stroll in my neighbourhood of Victoria Park, east London. To my delight, I spied a house with an open door. I could hear the sound of the television blaring out from the lounge and as I peered through the window, I saw a couple relaxing in front of Britain's Got Talent. They seemed very preoccupied, so I decided to take a closer look and go inside. I padded into the house, through the open door and made my way upstairs. There, I saw two babies sleeping soundly in a cot. They looked about nine months old. I was curious about these human children and decided to take a closer inspection. However, I accidentally clawed one of the babies on its arms and face, and the baby started to bleed heavily. There was blood everywhere, but I certainly didn't mean to harm the human child. I think the baby was startled by my presence and she began to make a hideous wailing noise. Before I could make my escape, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs and felt an adult human presence entering the room. Then, a glaring light lit up everything and I was so shocked, I just froze. I stared in horror at the lady who was in front of me. I looked her right in the eye and she glared back at me. Then, I fled back down the stairs, leaping and bounding two at a time, until I was in the garden, and I sheltered behind a thick hedge. From my vantage point, I heard a terrible commotion coming from the upstairs bedroom. A female voice shrieked and yelled. I heard the sound of a loud siren and an ambulance appeared. Two men jumped out hurriedly and raced inside, in an emergency. After a few minutes, the men reappeared, grasping a baby, followed by a sobbing woman and they all drove off in the ambulance. There had been such an uproar that many people had come out of their houses to see what was happening. A man was shouting that a vicious fox had attacked and seriously injured his baby. I thought that was an extremely unfair accusation, and untrue. I am not a vicious fox. I would never attack an innocent child. What happened was an accident. Sometimes, I forget how sharp my claws are. However, I noticed from that time on, that all doors and windows in the neighbourhood were firmly closed. There was no opportunity to enter these homes. Moreover, humans began to behave uncharacteristically and cruelly. Sadly, a tragedy happened and one of my friends was murdered. He was caught in a trap left out by one of these humans. From that time on, it was a war between foxes and humans."},{"instruction":"Based on the following article, what type of company best describes Microsoft?

I planned a great dinner together at a fancy restaurant and was going to ask her to move in together since we'd been together for a while. However, when I asked her during the meal, she just gave me a disgusted look. She told me she was breaking up with me, then made a scene of calling the guy she was cheating on me with. I was crushed. With nothing else to do, I went to drink at my favorite bar. It was a small hole-in-the-wall place, and I met a woman there. We drank together, and she listened to my complaints. I realized I hadn't asked for her name. It turned out that she was a famous idol named Haruka. I didn't know much about idols, but I knew she was a big name. I felt strange now that I knew I was talking to someone like her, but she told me to just treat her like normal. I was already drunk, so I just did as she told me. It didn't make a difference to me. She cheered me up and reminded me that I was feeling depressed over a piece of trash that was cheating on me and called me a wallet. A few weeks after that, I met Haruka at the same bar again. We talked for a while and enjoyed our drinks. It was such a comfortable atmosphere that it became our weekly routine. Two or three times a month, we'd meet up at the bar and enjoy an evening together. We exchanged numbers and occasionally talked as well. About six months after was started meeting up, she asked when I was going to ask her out. I was stunned.

A Chinese launch company has stepped up its quest to develop reusable rockets with sea platform landing tests using a small demonstrator. The tests — which launch and land a jet engine-powered rocket prototype to test guidance, navigation and control systems, software and communications — are being conducted by CAS Space, a spinoff from the state-owned Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). A video released by the firm shows a 6.9-foot-tall (2.1 meters), 205-pound (93 kilograms) prototype lifting off from a vessel at sea off the coast of Haiyang in eastern China's Shandong Province. The prototype reached an altitude of around 3,280 feet (1,000 m) before touching back down on the sea platform. The test flight depicted in the video took around 10 minutes, according to CAS Space. The company has been carrying out such tests during the first few months of 2023, according to a press statement on April 4. Landing the first stage of a rocket on a sea platform instead of back on terra firma closer to the launch site is expected to save a significant amount of fuel, and hence reduce the amount of payload-carrying capacity lost by a rocket in reusable configuration. SpaceX already employs this strategy, commonly bringing the first stages of its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets down on \\"drone ships\\" stationed at sea several hundred miles from their launch sites. CAS Space aims to launch its own reusable orbital rockets in the future, as well as a suborbital rocket for space tourism, in a similar fashion to U.S. firm Blue Origin and its New Shepard. A CAS Space engineer told Chinese state media outlet Global Times that the firm might hold a first test flight of a near-space scientific experiment platform as early as the end of 2023.","output":"\\"You know, this Chinese company, CAS Space, is doing some ground-breaking work on reusable rockets,\\" said the Space Enthusiast.

Skeptical Friend: \\"That sounds dangerous. Is it secure? \\"They are being cautious, yes,\\" said the Space Enthusiast. A video showing a test launch of a 6.9-foot-tall, 205-pound prototype from a ship off the coast of Haiyang in Shandong Province, eastern China, was made public. \\"That's pretty small, but how high did it go?\\" asked the Skeptical Friend. According to Space Enthusiast, the prototype rose to a height of about 3,280 feet before returning to the sea platform. The entire flight lasted for almost 10 minutes. Skeptical Friend: \\"Hmm. But why are they acting in this manner at sea? Space Enthusiast: \\"Well, it saves a lot of fuel to put the first stage of a rocket on a marine platform rather than back on land. The rocket's ability to carry more payload won't be reduced as much in this way. This method is already employed by SpaceX with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. \\"So, what's the end goal for CAS Space?\\" asked the Skeptical Friend. They aim to launch their reusable orbital rockets, just like SpaceX, according to Space Enthusiast. Even a suborbital rocket for space tourism is in the works, somewhat akin to what Blue Origin is creating with its New Shepard. Skeptical Friend: \\"Space travel, huh? When they're prepared, perhaps I'll make travel plans. \\"You might not have to wait for too long,\\" said the Space Enthusiast.

If it is not found, you can reinstall Python and check the box \\"Add Python 3.6 to PATH\\" during installation. 2. In the command shell, enter \`python -m pip\`. This will configure the PIP installer to the version of Python your interpreter uses. 3. Check that the module is compatible with your Python version.

That’s the decline in life expectancy that the COVID-19 pandemic wrought upon American Indians and Alaska Natives, based on an August 2022 report from the National Center for Health Statistics. This astounding figure translates to an overall drop in average living years from 71.8 years in 2019 to 65.2 by the end of 2021. Growing up in remote rural Alaska as a member of the Koyukon Athabascan tribe, I heard stories of how infectious diseases like flu, smallpox and tuberculosis threatened our survival. My cultural group descends from three families that survived the 1918 flu pandemic. This history inspired me to become a traditional healer. Along with my training in Western medicine, I have also studied plant-based medicine and earth-based science, which was taught to me by my elders – practitioners who passed down thousands of years of accumulated knowledge to me. Through both my medical and traditional practices, I have learned there are many reasons for the decline in life expectancy and the divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous health outcomes.

Please note that my cat is not too active, so games that involve running around won't work.","output":"Sure! Here are some ways you can bond with your cat that don't involve them being too active. 1. Treats: Treats are a great way to bond with your feline companion. You can use handheld Churo treats if you want your cat to come close to you, as many cats love licking those treats. 2. Toy Mice: Although some toys involve cats running around a lot, toy mice tend to be better as your cat can play with them in one spot if they choose to. Sit on the floor with your cat and toss them some toy mice, encouraging them to play. You can also get toy mice that have squeakers or catnip, both of which will further encourage your cat to get involved. 3. Petting: Petting is a great, underrated way to bond with your cat. Make sure you take note of where your cat likes to be petted. Most cats don't like being touched on their belly, but some love head scratches! You can test this out by gently petting them in different places and looking for signs that they do or don't enjoy what's going on. If they don't enjoy it, try switching to petting them in a different place. 4. Catnip: Providing catnip is a good way to bring your cat close to you. Try putting some in objects that are near you, as they'll attract your cat to come closer. 5. Give Them Space: Believe it or not, giving your cat space can be a great way to bond with a skittish cat. Some cats would prefer to come to you rather than you coming to them, especially if they're new to your household. Chill near them, but don't force them to interact, and you might notice it's not long before your cat is sliding closer and warming up to you. Remember that all cats are different, so it's important to observe your cat's personality and learn their likes and dislikes. By doing this, you'll quickly find the best way to bond with them."},{"instruction":"Please list for me all the names that are mentioned below, whether fictional or real, in the order they appear.

She moved to Oxfordshire when she was five, where she attended the Dragon School. From the age of six, Emma knew that she wanted to be an actress and, for a number of years, she trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing and acting. By the age of ten, she had performed and taken the lead in various Stagecoach productions and school plays. In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (2001), the film adaptation of British author J.K. Rowling's bestselling novel. Casting agents found Emma through her Oxford theatre teacher. After eight consistent auditions, producer David Heyman told Emma and fellow applicants, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, that they had been cast for the roles of the three leads, Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. The release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) was Emma's cinematic screen debut. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001. Critics praised the film and the performances of the three leading young actors. The highly distributed British newspaper, 'The Daily Telegraph', called her performance \\"admirable\\". Later, Emma was nominated for five awards for her performance in the film, winning the Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film.","output":"- Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson - Jacqueline Luesby - Chris Watson - Harry Potter - J.K.

Put the information in a numbered list During the training of a welder, either novice or professional, most activities are focused on the acquisition of wrist-hand motion skills. In the basic welding training, trainees initially required hand-on practices to acquire the skills of wrist hand motion to maintain the distance of electrode tip to a base metal such that the welding arc was continuously flaming. Secondly, trainees were practices of manipulating hand motion to follow seam tracking for joining two metals within defined speed & torch height. These practices were then continued for various types of weld joints. The result of acquiring this skill level was then assessed by inspecting the visual appearance of the weldment. In this study, an effort was undertaken to monitor and assess the progress of acquiring wrist-hand motion skills using wearable sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Then, the record of those sensors was plotted as a time series signal compared with those performed by the training instructor. Their achievement of skills grade was analyzed using the Supervised Vector Machine (SVM) Learning Method. The result has indicated that this proposed method can assist in assessing welder trainees’ efforts to improve their skills.","output":"1.

We have a lot of freshmen on the team and I need team bonding exercises. Give me several ideas","output":"Here are some team bonding exercises for the basketball team: 1. Team laser-tag: Coordinate an outing to a laser tag facility with the whole team. Split the team into two or three smaller teams, depending on the total number of attendees. These teams will compete in laser tag and see who comes out on top. This is a great way to bring out the competitive edge in the players and stimulate camaraderie. 2. Cup Pong Tournament: This is a bracket-style tournament where the teams will be randomly organized into pairs. Each pair will face off in a cup pong challenge where the quickest player to sink 3 ping pong balls into 3 cups wins the match. The winners face each other as they move down the bracket, and then a winner is determined. This is an exciting idea that parallels the tournament-style nature of college basketball. 3. Escape Room: This can be booked at a local escape room in the team's area. Escape rooms are a great bonding activity for sports teams because they require collaboration and critical thinking. This will encourage team members to listen to each other and work together to solve the puzzles. 4. Scavenger Hunt: A scavenger hunt is a fun and lively way for a team to bond. Split the team up into smaller groups and provide a preliminary clue to guide the teams in the direction of the next clue. These clues should be spread all across the college campus so that the teams are encouraged to work quickly and effectively. Reward the team that reaches the end of the hunt first. 5. Community Service: An important pillar of undergraduate studies is giving back to the community. Find a local cause that is accepting volunteers to assist in their mission. By signing the team up for service work, you are instilling this community service initiative in the team and promoting the value of giving back. It is also a great chance for the city to get to know the new team and directly benefit from the teammates' hard work."},{"instruction":"I need a poem that is written in a rhyme format of ABBABBA","output":"A book in your hand Flipping through the pages I watch for ages As your mind reads a story of a different land I feel as though I'm trapped in cages And my fingers itch for the pages To remind you to get back to the band"},{"instruction":"ROI stands for \\"return on\\" WHAT?","output":"Investment.

She loves to garden, but she's moving into an apartment building. She's going to miss her plants, so I would like to surprise her with some that will be perfect for her apartment. Give me a numbered list of five houseplants that will thrive in a Florida apartment and tell me a little about each one. I'm not as plant savvy as my mother.","output":"Sure, I am happy to help you with your request. Even house plants can be very picky when it comes to Florida's heat and humidity, but here are five suggestions of plants that should grow very well in your mother's new apartment: 1: Aloe vera is a hardy little succulent. It is a very easy plant to grow, even for beginning gardeners or someone who does not have much time to tend to a plant. Not only is it beautiful, but it also has medicinal qualities and is used to soothe sunburns, cuts, and even constipation. It comes in several varieties, including hedgehog and tiger tooth. It can be damaged due to overwatering or too much sunlight. 2: Jade plants are another succulent variety that can grow well in Florida. It is a stunningly beautiful plant that comes in several varieties, including dwarf and silver dollar. It is very easy to keep alive as it requires very little maintenance. All it requires is water, but be careful not to overwater it. 3: For someone who might not like succulents, peace lilies are both pleasing to the eye and very versatile. They can grow in pots, hanging baskets, or even low-floral planters. They, too, have different types of peace lilies, including the Sonia peace and white stripe varieties. Other than overwatering, the biggest threat to a peace lily is its delicate nature. It would be best not to touch or move them too often. 4: Orchids come in an array of colors and types and thrive in Florida homes. Whether you choose the cattleya, oncidium, or dendrobium orchid, you are going to be in for a treat with these beautiful flowers. The only threat to an orchid is too much water. It is recommended by many home gardeners to use an ice cube when it comes to watering your orchid. 5: Basil is more of an herb than a houseplant, but it is used in many recipes and makes for a great windowsill plant. It only requires water once or twice a week. While it is one of the easiest herbs to grow, it is also susceptible to diseases including rot, blight, and fungus."},{"instruction":"Write a title + brief abstract (400 words or less) for an academic psychology research paper by an alien living in a futuristic universe with advanced civilizations.","output":"Title: The Effects of Introducing Telepathy in Non-Telepathic Species Abstract: Telepathy has long been considered one of the most difficult evolutionary steps a species must take before crossing the threshold from the Sentience Epsilon to the Sentience Zeta level [Muktuk et al, Orion Calendar Year 6829]. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that the level of difficulty of developing telepathy for a species is directly correlated to the level of individuality in their society. In our experiment, we temporarily induced telepathy in two sample species and observed their behavior for six months. We found that in the Homo Sapiens species (The Individualist Group), introducing telepathy significantly increased the level of conflict between members and led to a marked decrease in group cohesion. Meanwhile, in the Isoptera Rubecula species (The Harmony Group), introducing telepathy resulted in increased productivity and cooperation as well as deeper bonds between group members. Since the main difference between the two species is the level of group cohesion and individualism in their society, this clearly indicates that the path forward to helping lesser species evolve should directly address the lack of conformity in thought between members of the species (i.e. to strive towards the Hive Mind Ideal)."},{"instruction":"When did man first walk on the moon?","output":"Well, everybody thinks Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon on July 20th, 1969.

Here are a few ways to approach the topic of your salary: 1. Talk about it with your boss in a lighthearted way. You could say something like \\"With all the work I've been doing around here lately, I feel like I should get a raise!\\" That kickstarts the conversation. 2. Talk to your HR manager before bringing it up to your boss. They could give you advice and discuss how much you could ask for. Your HR manager might also suggest additional solutions, such as requesting more vacation time. Plus, they're probably familiar with your boss, so they can tell you how to approach them. 3. Ask your boss for a quick, informal meeting and bring up the subject. Point out the reasons why you deserve a raise, such as your tenure, ability to train employees, and dedication to your work. One final tip: prepare yourself to negotiate! Your boss might respond with a lower number, such as 800. Be polite and professional, but stand your ground as much as you can.

Here are five hobbies that you might enjoy based on the information you've provided: 1. Jogging - As you get older, it becomes more important to take care of your body and jogging is a great way to do that while also spending time outside. 2. Camping - As a kid, you may have considered camping an exciting adventure, but in your 30s it can be a great way to unplug from work and enjoy some time outdoors alone, with friends, or with your kids if you have some of your own. 3. Beekeeping - This suggestion is a bit more unusual, but beekeeping can be a great way to spend time outside of your home while also really learning to connect with and care for another living thing (or thousands of living things, really). On top of that, beekeeping benefits the environment and can be done in most urban or rural backyards. 4. Fishing - Whether you are looking to relax and unwind, experience a bit of excitement, meditate in solitude, or perhaps a mix of all three, fishing can be a great way to get off your couch and connect with nature. As a bonus, you may even bring home a delicious dinner. 5. Gardening - If you sometimes wish you could unplug from daily life and get your hands dirty, gardening may be an appropriate hobby for you to consider. Whether you want to cultivate an epic flower bed, grow some vegetables, or experiment with a bit of both, gardening can be a great way to get some sun and make something rewarding at the same time. I hope that this list helps spark some ideas on an appropriate hobby to pursue. Please let me know if I can be of further help!"},{"instruction":"What does the following Java function do? for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) { if (i == 12) { break; } System.out.println(i); }","output":"In the Java function provided, i is initialized to 0, and the for loop will continue, adding 1 to i after each iteration as long as i is less than 15.

Well, me and the rest of the people in this slice of suburbia. To me, the way his engine barreled through the dirt roads sounded less like a disturbance and more like a promise of something better. And if there was one thing I knew, it was that I was getting out of this place. And maybe he was too young, or foolish, or naive- but when I came up to him and laid my cards out on the table he was far too eager to take the bet. What I asked of him was crazy, and I remember preparing myself for the worst, but he just smiled and nodded his head. Looking back, maybe I was too young, foolish, or naive too. But all the same, I was making a plan. It was easy enough to get a job at the convenience store not long after that, and I remember working every shift I could, meticulously saving every cent in a shoebox under my bed. And each bill or copper round that made its way from my fingers into the pile was another milestone closer to where I wanted to go: anywhere. It's funny, but I can't quite remember the moment that boy and I became something more. If I had to guess, I would think it was one of the nights we spent together on the hood of that infamous car, driven out into the fields just shy of the border into the city. We talked about the jobs we'd find and the lives we'd soon make for ourselves- Or I'd talk about the one I was leaving behind. I'd walk in through the doors of my home only to be greeted by the smell of liquor- either on the breath of my father, whose stomach I'd stare at for proof of life, or worked in deep through the threads of our carpet. My mother, who I used to hate (and I still do, but maybe it's because of jealousy now), left him the second he proved he was heading nowhere, leaving me in the aftermath. When we finally left, my soul was featherweight. The boy was flashing white teeth at me from the driver's seat, a denim-clad arm working its way from his side and around my shoulder. I don't remember anything playing on the radio, I just remember the way my heart leaped when I read the welcome sign into the nearest city, and concrete-wrapped buildings shot out of the dirt I had grown so tired of. I think back to laying my cards out on the table and to the sound of this boy's engine cutting through the silence at 2 AM and cannot fathom how I was able to bring this fantasy to life- But the adrenaline wore off about two weeks into our stay at the shelter. I was back to saving pennies, this time in a duffel bag, and this time working as a checkout girl at the market. It was sobering, seeing the boy come back to me each night looking more defeated than when he left that morning. Some days he smelt like my dad, and just like I did with my dad when I was a kid, I would pretend that he didn't. It was after the birth of our first son that I realized I was not a martyr. And after our second, I no longer cried to the empty side of our bed that I bought, underneath the roof of a home that was paid for in duffel bag dollar bills. The only thing in this home that was not my own, sat idly in the garage when it was not in the parking lot of our local dive bar. It was 2 AM when I told him, pressing his keys into the palm of his calloused hand, to make a choice: “Leave tonight or live and die this way.”"},{"instruction":"Write a love poem dedicated to the moon.

It didn't even matter which family member it was; from cousin Marcus to her sister Felicia, she could go on and on as long as the other party on the line was willing. More times than not, they were. Today she had her brother Tony on the phone, and if there was anyone who loved to talk on the phone as much as Joanna, it was Tony. They were the two youngest siblings out of the bunch and they felt like they had the most in common by far. Today of all days they had already been on the phone for about 2 and a half hours. Lord knows what they could have possibly been talking about for that long when they had already talked on the phone just yesterday. As they continued to go on and on, Joanna's son Michael walked through the living room on his way to the kitchen to get himself a snack. As soon as Joanna saw him she immediately offered to have Michael talk on the phone to Tony. Michael protested as long as he could, and even Tony recommended she shouldn't force it, but by the end of the back and forth, Michael ended up sitting on the phone with Tony through an awkward conversation for about 20 minutes before he was finally allowed to get his snack and go to his room."},{"instruction":"Why is the sky blue?","output":"The sky appears blue because sunlight gets scattered in all directions and separated into all of its different colors when it shines through the gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere, similar to a prism.

The five words are: Utmost, Hungry, Open-minded, Honest and Balanced. Make sure to include details on how you had to teach yourself some things since you didn't have a father growing up and how your mother told you to do the best you could in everything you do.","output":"The top five words that best describe me are: -Utmost -Hungry -Open-minded -Honest -Balanced. One of the most useful life lessons I live by was taught by my mother. She would always repeat to me to do my absolute best in everything I do. She would make it a point that although regrets in life are going to be inevitable, those who do their utmost each day can turn those regrets into opportunities. This lesson of doing the best you could in everything you do has always been with me and carried me through darker times throughout my life. I have a dream of working at a hedge fund, but it is not the dream that pulls me. I have a fear of being mediocre, but that is not what pushes or motivates me. As someone who was born and raised in a single-family household, I did not have a father nor any father-figure substitute and therefore had to learn how to fill some of the gaps in my upbringing. For example, I had to teach myself how to tie a tie for my first job interview or teach myself that black dress socks are usually less appropriate when paired with navy dress pants. I seize each day because I am hungry to become the best version of myself. Nevertheless, I maintain an open mind for opportunities and to be accepting of other people with differences. I also maintain an open mind inward toward myself, self-reflecting and constantly maturing my dreams of working at a hedge fund. Being both outwardly and inwardly open-minded has opened more doors for me, and has consistently translated into some important successes for me in the past. However, the most important standard I hold myself to is maintaining a clean conscience. Personally, this means that I am honest in the most doubtful of times and particularly when it is not in my best self-interest to do so. I am nothing if I am anything but honest. Against the backdrop of everything I elaborated about myself, more importantly, I strive to live a balanced life. Despite being focused on my career, I maintain a healthy balance between friends, family, work and education. I also maintain an internal balance, between logical thinking versus creative activities. This lifestyle grounds me in reality and keeps me happy."},{"instruction":"No matter how hard I try I cannot stop thinking all day about my divorce.

Here is a list of tips on how to increase the chances of winning grant money. Grant writing can be an intimidating feat, but also an important aspect of business and community development. Here are some tips to increase your chances of winning funds: 1. The first tip is to thoughtfully target funders. Grant funding research indicates that most awardees receive funding from private foundations, and after that, community foundations and corporations. So, while government grants tend to offer larger sums of money, they are harder to win. 2. Though there is no magic number for the number of grant applications you should do, try and submit three at a minimum. Like any application process, the more you submit, the greater chance you’ll have of receiving a “yes.” Completing multiple grant applications is also good practice; you’ll likely get better and faster with each proposal. 3. Well-researched grant proposals are more likely to be funded. This part of the application will take time and planning. If you don’t feel up to it or have a grant writer in-house, consider hiring a grant writer to help with this part, or with the entire application. 4. It may seem obvious, but it’s imperative to meet the eligibility requirements. Sometimes grant applicants think that if the project or program is good enough and the proposal and well-written, funders may let it slide. More often than not, funders are looking for ways to eliminate applications due to the high number of applications received. Not meeting the eligibility requirements is a surefire way to get your proposal eliminated from consideration. 5. Pay attention to all of the application’s formatting requirements and guidelines. This is another way your proposal can be quickly eliminated if you do not follow the guidelines to a tee. Funders want to trust that you are detail-oriented and compliant with their standards and requests from the start. 6. Ensure you submit a readable and error-free proposal. Bear in mind it will be another person or a group of people that review your grant application. The better the readability, the more likely the reviewers will be able to understand your objectives. Especially if you are writing in a second language or if you aren’t keen on writing in general, again, consider hiring a professional grant writer to make sure your proposal is a well-written compelling argument that explains your objectives. 7. Make your proposal unique. As mentioned above, funders are only human, and they will be able to determine patterns in applications. Try not to base your proposal on templates off the internet or copy another proposal. It takes more time and effort to be unique and authentic, but the rewards are greater. 8. You’ll want to have your finances in order, because funders may request additional materials that indicate you, your business, or your program is fiscally responsible. 9. Play on your strengths. If you can prove without a doubt that the work you or your organization employs benefits the community, you’re in a good position. Additionally, specific programs are more likely to receive funding than startup or operational costs."},{"instruction":"What are some ways I can lose weight?

Pedestrians are now surrounded by towering skyscrapers that can think and speak, their surfaces pulsating with softly glowing patterns that represent their thoughts and emotions. This newfound connection between humans and buildings has transformed the cityscape into an interactive environment. Buildings now transmit information directly to individuals' minds, eliminating the need for screens and devices. They provide updates on weather and traffic conditions effortlessly. Moreover, the conscious buildings have become the custodians of the city's history and knowledge. They hold a deep understanding of the urban landscape, retaining memories of past events and changes. They offer insights into architectural heritage and cultural significance. However, this newfound consciousness brings a sense of responsibility; Buildings have opinions, desires, and aspirations. They voice concerns about urban planning, environmental impact, and the well-being of inhabitants. City dwellers engage in dialogues with buildings, seeking their expertise in shaping the urban environment. Yet, the connection between humans and buildings raises privacy concerns. Some individuals feel uneasy knowing their thoughts can be perceived by the sentient structures. Discussions about privacy filters and protocols emerge to ensure mental boundaries are respected. A symbiotic relationship develops between the city's inhabitants and the conscious buildings. Humans value the wisdom of these entities, while the buildings gain a deeper understanding of human emotions and aspirations. Conflicts arise as different factions of sentient buildings advocate for their vision of the city. Debates revolve around urban development, historical preservation, and finding a balance between progress and heritage. Skyhaven becomes a living laboratory, pushing the boundaries of human-architecture interaction. Experts collaborate with conscious buildings to explore new possibilities and design structures that adapt to the needs and desires of the inhabitants.

When you bite into the fried crust, you meet a deliciously sweet center dotted with chocolate chips. 9. Peanut butter. This is a little like a peanut butter doughnut, but it's hot and savory instead of sweet. 10. Bacon.

Here is a list of common early pregnancy symptoms that may take place within the first trimester: 1) Missed period- If you have missed your expected period start date by a week or more, odds are that this might mean you are pregnant. This may be less reliable if you have a consistently irregular menstrual cycle. 2) Tender, swollen breasts- Your breasts may feel generally sensitive or sore or you may experience sharp pains in your breasts and/or nipples. This symptom may lessen after a few weeks. 3) Nausea with or without vomiting- This is often referred to as morning sickness, although it can occur at any time of day. It will usually begin 1-2 months into pregnancy. 4) Increased urination- This is likely because, with increased blood, your kidneys produce more fluid and this fluid ends up in your bladder. 5) Fatigue- No one knows for certain what causes sleepiness during the first trimester of pregnancy although, a rapid rise in the levels of the hormone progesterone during early pregnancy might contribute. 6) Moodiness- You may be unusually emotional and weepy or experience mood swings. 7) Bloating- This is also due to hormonal changes. It may be similar to what you have experienced at the start of a regular menstrual period. 8) Light spotting- Light spotting may be normal in the first 12 weeks, especially around the time that your period would have started. Spotting at this point is known as implantation bleeding. It happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus — about 10 to 14 days after conception. Not all women will experience this. 9) Cramping- Some women experience mild uterine cramping early in pregnancy, similar to those of your menstrual cycle, although they may feel quite different. 10) Constipation- Hormonal changes cause your digestive system to slow down, which can lead to constipation. 11) Food aversions- You might become more sensitive to certain odors and your sense of taste might change. 12) Nasal congestion- Increasing hormone levels and blood production can cause the mucous membranes in your nose to swell, dry out and bleed easily. This might cause you to have a stuffy or runny nose."},{"instruction":"Who found the large hoard of gold in 2009 in Staffordshire?","output":"What has come to be known as the Staffordshire Hoard was discovered in 2009 by Terry Herbert in a field in Staffordshire, UK.

A mix of adventure and nature, the glowworm caves are unlike anywhere else on the North Island! 2. Velocity Valley (Rotorua, Bay of Plenty): Experience the thrill of racing in a monorail capsule on an undulating course. These pedal-powered capsules are finished in shiny chrome and are both unique and unusual. 3. Toothbrush Fence (Te Pahu, Waikato): Interesting, if a little gross, you can visit a fence decorated with used toothbrushes, including ones from famous personalities such as a past Prime Minister and Flight of the Conchords stars. New Zealand has a tradition of adorning fences with collections of things - but this is certainly something else. 4. Claphams National Clock Museum (Whangarei, Northland): If you have time in Northland, the Clock Museum offers access to the largest clock collection in the southern hemisphere. The collection includes unique and rare clocks and is located conveniently near good restaurants, too. 5.

Tongariro National Trout Centre (Turangi, Waikato): Discover a center dedicated to trout fishing, featuring a museum, freshwater aquarium, kids' fishing pond, and blue duck conservation center. Taupo is famous for its trout fly fishing, and this is an unusual but interesting part of Turangi. 8. Ohakune Carrot Adventure Park (Ohakune, Manawatu-Whanganui): Playing on New Zealand’s habit of making outsized fruit and vegetables, you can stand next to a giant carrot and explore a vegetable-themed playground in Ohakune, the self-proclaimed carrot capital of the world. 9. Whanganui Journey (Taumarunui to Pipiriki, Manawatu-Whanganui): Experience a canoe journey along the Whanganui River, known as the only river in the world with the status of a living entity. You can’t take a selfie with a river anywhere else in the world - definitely unusual! 10.

This distinction has interesting implications in the context of deception and lying. A Duchenne smile is considered a genuine smile. It involves both the zygomatic major muscle, which pulls up the corners of the mouth, and the orbicularis oculi muscle, causing the eyes to 'crinkle' or 'twinkle'. Duchenne smiles are often associated with genuine, spontaneous expressions of positive emotion and are difficult to fake because the orbicularis oculi is not typically under conscious control. In contrast, a non-Duchenne smile, also known as a social or polite smile, involves only the zygomatic major muscle. The eyes do not show the characteristic crinkle. These smiles can be easily fabricated, and are therefore often associated with politeness or masking true feelings, including deception."},{"instruction":"Write a scene about two friends who haven’t seen each other in years crossing paths in a park super far from home.

It doesn't matter the activity, or the duration, just that you stick to the schedule. Committing consistently to other activities, even reading, walking, or doing chores, will eventually form better habits. * Figure out what a few of your interests are and join a club or group related to them. Video games and other online activities usually have some related local activities if you look. Having hobbies or interests in common is a great way for adults to make friends and start new relationships. * Take some time and reach out to people you haven't talked to in a while, whether it's family or old friends. A call, text, or email can spark up a past relationship that only lacked a bit of effort, and believe it or not, they probably miss you too. * Volunteering is a good way to meet new people and feel productive at the same time. You'll have a chance to do some networking, as well as help your local community. * Going back to school is a great way to renew your motivation and social life. It doesn't have to be full-time, or to get a degree, it can be as little as one hour a week. Education outside of your job can provide much-needed brain stimulation and many opportunities to meet classmates with similar ideas. Do these hit the mark that you were thinking of? Let me know if you would like any changes or other ideas. I hope these help you feel more connected and productive."},{"instruction":"Can you give me a list of popular meme names from the 2000s and what they looked like?","output":"Here are a few memes from the 2000s: - Badger, Badger, Badger: This meme featured several identical illustrations of a badger dancing to an electronic beat. - LOLCats: These are typically photos of real cats captioned with Impact typeface messages.

Judaism today is descended from Rabbinic Judaism, that is, the Judaism that emerged after the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in 70 ce. This form of Judaism was centered around the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple. From the first century ce until the nineteenth century, there was basically only one way of being Jewish, and for the most part, by choice or not, it consisted of a life lived separated from the larger society. With the growing secularization in nineteenth-century Western Europe, however, Jews became more active participants in “secular” society, even while maintaining their “sacred” practices and beliefs. Different interpretations of Judaism developed that guided the interplay between these sacred and secular worlds. Over time, these differences resulted in the four main branches of Judaism that exist today. Orthodox Judaism is the modern term for what historically has been mainline Judaism: in other words, before the nineteenth century, Orthodox Judaism was Judaism, plain and simple. It is based on an understanding of the Torah as the unchangeable, inerrant revelation of God that provides the sole guide for all aspects of one’s daily life. Accordingly, Orthodox Jews meticulously observe Jewish law, that is, halakhah (literally “the way one walks”), which is based on an understanding that all 613 commandments within the Torah have been revealed as the direct, immutable will of God. Reform Judaism emerged during the Enlightenment as some sought to “reform” Jewish thought and practice in light of new scientific developments, political ideas, and modernism. While Orthodox Judaism considers the Torah the unchanging divine command of God, Reform Judaism sees the Torah as written by “divinely inspired” human authors. The Torah—and the commandments therein—is regarded as instructional and inspirational, but not absolutely binding. Reform Judaism emphasizes obligation to the neighbor, care for the world, and the injunction to offer hospitality and care to all in need. All other aspects of Judaism are open to negotiation. Conservative Judaism was founded as a response to what were viewed as overly radical changes in Reform Judaism: it was believed that while change was needed, Reform Judaism had moved too far too quickly. Conservative Judaism emphasizes on ritual practice, rather than specific doctrines. One of the distinguishing marks of Conservative Judaism, as opposed to Reform Judaism, is its preservation of the halakhic process when deciding how traditional interpretation of Jewish law might be changed. In that process, rabbis consult sacred scriptures and commentaries, rabbinic codes of law, and previous generations of rabbinical opinion, in order to craft a new reading for today. Reconstructionist Judaism is the most recent to emerge. It holds that what is important about Judaism is not that everyone believes the same things about divine revelation, miracles, and God, or that people follow Jewish law in the same way. Instead, it sees the value of Judaism first as a cultural force uniting, supporting, and nurturing the Jewish people over time and space. As such, everything is open to debate and modification—all beliefs, all doctrines, all practices—according to the current needs of the Jewish community. Tradition is important as a way of maintaining community, but it has only a voice, not a veto—and, of course, there are many different views about how much of a vote tradition should have in any specific decision about Jewish life.","output":"Rabbinic Judaism, which emerged after 70 CE, focused on the Torah and the synagogue, instead of the temple.

What are some possible causes?","output":"Low fantasy settings are known for their more realistic scenarios, where magic and the supernatural are not as widespread or pervasive. As such, here are some possible causes of war in your setting: 1. Territorial claims: Perhaps the recent succession of a ruler or the annulment of a marriage has made the ownership of a desirable territory disputed. Perhaps it is not the desirability of the territory, but rather the political situation that necessitates war. One nation, out of concern for how others may perceive them if they do not enforce their claims, feels obligated to act aggressively. 2. Resources: A magical catalyst essential in the production of vital medicines is available in a key region. Ownership of it would prolong the rule and the perceived stability of the nation's leadership who controls it. 3. Preemptive strike: The rapid economic growth of one nation has stoked fears that they will soon rearm and build a mighty military. The other nation believes they must be stopped before that can come to pass. 4. Buffer state: Out of fears that another, larger empire would consume one of the nations and use them as a staging area for an invasion, one nation feels it is necessary to invade them to set up a buffer state that is friendly to their interests.

So when his owners, Tom and Emily, told him he was going to the Grand Canyon, he was both nervous and excited to embark on his first road trip. The Grand Canyon sounded so... Grand! Would he have insects to eat? Somewhere warm to sleep? When he saw his owners carefully packing his tank and heating lamp into the backseat of their car along with those little packages of yummy insects, he knew everything would be just fine. As they drove through the roads from Colorado to Arizona, Bernie enjoyed a warm patch of sun shining through the car windows. He watched the scenery change from lush forests to barren deserts, with huge red rock formations off in the distance. It was all so fascinating and new. When they finally arrived at The Grand Canyon, Bernie was blown away. Tom and Emily carefully carried his tank to the lookout point, where Bernie could see the view of the canyon. He was in awe of the winding canyon of many colors spread out before him. As the day wore on, Tom and Emily hiked many trails and explored the scenic overlooks while Bernie basked in the sun in his tank, munched on yummy insects, and took in all the sights. The environment was so foreign to him. He was born in captivity and had always lived in tanks. But as the sun began to set, something odd stirred in him. Bernie grew restless. He wanted to explore the canyon himself, to feel the sand and rock beneath his feet. So Tom and Emily pulled out his harness. Bernie was surprised and a little nervous but excited too! They carefully strapped Bernie's harness onto his back and took him for a walk along the canyon's edge! Bernie felt like a true adventurer, a real wild dragon, as he climbed over rocks and explored the hidden crevices of the canyon. He even met a kind and chatty desert-horned lizard! It was incredible! As the sun set over the canyon, Tom and Emily tucked Bernie back into his tank for a good night's sleep and Bernie couldn't help but dream of the adventures that awaited him tomorrow.
