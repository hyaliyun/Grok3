Let's learn about an important topic about doctors and money. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is like a big group of really smart and important doctors who help take care of us. They tell us that to make a big promise come true, £3 billion is needed. What promise? It is a promise made by a man named Mr. Miliband who wants people to be able to see their family doctor or GP in just two days. You might be wondering, what is a GP? Well, a GP or General Practitioner is a kind of doctor who helps your whole family with simple medical problems like a cold, a fever or a stomach ache. Mr. Miliband is a person who sometimes makes important decisions for our country and tells what can be done to make things better. He says that when people feel sick, they should have the right to see their family doctor really quickly, like in just two days!  Did you know that a long time ago, the last Labour government - which is a group of people who make important decisions for our country - tried to do something similar? They made a target for doctors to see patients quickly, but it was not followed by the Coalition, which is a different group of people who make decisions. Sometimes, doctors are worried about having too many rules that can make their job even harder. So, they want Mr. Miliband and his friends to think very carefully before adding any new rules like this one. In conclusion, the Royal College of GPs says it will take a lot of money to make Mr. Miliband's promise about seeing family doctors in just two days come true. We all like to think that when we are sick, our doctor will be there to help us in no time. And as we grow up, it's important that we all learn about how our country is working to improve health services for everyone.

Add Interest      The motive for the shooting, just before 1 p.m. in the baggage claim area at Terminal 2, remained unclear and the alleged gunman appears to have acted alone.      The airport was closed to departing and arriving flights following the shooting, but cargo and general aviation (private small planes, corporate jets) operations resumed at midnight. Commercial flights will resume Saturday, the airport tweeted Friday evening.      \\"We have not ruled out terrorism,\\" FBI Special Agent in Charge George Piro said in an evening press conference.      Law enforcement officials say the suspect, Esteban Santiago, was carrying military identification. He was apprehended and placed in federal custody. He is expected to face federal charges.      Early Saturday morning, the Broward County Sheriff's Office posted his booking record, including booking photo, on its website. According to the record, he was booked on a murder charge. His \\"charge status\\" reads \\"Pending Trial,\\" and \\"Description\\" reads \\"Hold for US Marshals Office.\\"      According to senior officials, the suspect flew from Anchorage, Alaska to Fort Lauderdale via Minneapolis. He boarded the plane in Alaska last night. He only checked one bag -- a hard case carrying his gun, Anchorage Airport Police told ABC News. TSA regulations allow guns to be checked into baggage if they are stored in a locked, hard-sided container that cannot be easily accessed.      According to a Broward County commissioner, he allegedly loaded the gun in the bathroom and came out firing. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said that he fired \\"indiscriminately\\" at people in the airport.

These photos show the alleged gun used and the suspected shooter being led away by law enforcement, according to an eyewitness.      Mark Lea      Diane Haggerty, a woman who said she works at a cruise line's kiosk at the airport, told ABC News she also heard what she thought was firecrackers but turned out to be gunfire.      Haggerty said she saw a gunman \\"walking up and down shooting people\\" and dived behind the kiosk for safety.      In addition to those injured initially amid the gunfire, 37 were injured after the incident, according to the Broward County Sheriff. Six trauma patients admitted after the shooting are in stable condition, according to the Broward Health Medical Center. Doctors would not give specifics on their injuries because of privacy laws. Multiple other patients were admitted due to minor injuries such as dehydration and heat-related issues, the doctors said.      The FBI said they were not aware of any incident on board the flight or at the baggage claim.      Friday evening, details were beginning to emerge about the suspect.      NorthJersey.com      Santiago, who spent nine years in the military, was a combat engineer with the Alaska Army National Guard and left the military in August, said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, director of public affairs for the Alaska National Guard. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions at the rank of Private First Class.      He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011.      Along the way, he earned a number of awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal, according to his service record.      A senior law enforcement official said that Santiago walked into the Anchorage FBI field office in November 2016, after his discharge from the military and said he was under mind control by a U.S. intelligence agency.      The official said he appeared incoherent and agitated, saying the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos.      However, he said he didn't want to hurt anyone. Still, the FBI contacted local law enforcement, which, out of caution, had him medically evaluated. The FBI closed the probe after reviewing databases and interviewing family the official said.      Sources told ABC News that Santiago had received mental health treatment after the encounter with the FBI. A person who answered the phone for Signal 88 -- a company in Anchorage where Santiago worked in a security capacity -- said it has no comment and is \\"currently under the advisement of federal authorities.\\"      Authorities are \\"tearing apart\\" Santiago's service record to determine if he was suffering from PTSD, a senior law enforcement official briefed on the case told ABC News. Investigators are also digging deep into Santiago's social media and online activity, the official said.      Members of Santiago's family in New Jersey are being interviewed by the FBI, two law enforcement officials briefed on the probe told ABC News.      \\"God have mercy not only for us but for everyone,\\" Santiago's aunt, Maria Ruiz, speaking in Spanish, told reporters outside her Union City, N.J., home Friday. \\"I am really sorry.

Officials said the suspect is in custody. (Thomas Johnson,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)      A lone gunman who had just gotten off of a flight pulled a gun from his checked baggage and opened fire Friday at the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., international airport, killing five people and injuring eight others in a brief, bloody shooting rampage that terrorized.      The attack at a quiet baggage claim area sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country’s busiest airports, shutting down all flights while paramedics and federal and local law enforcement officers flooded the scene.      The suspected shooter is in federal custody, officials said Friday night. It appears he acted alone, said Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. In addition to the people slain, eight others were brought to area hospitals, all with apparent gunshot wounds, while dozens of others were injured in the chaos that followed the shooting.      Police did not immediately identify a motive for the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, which they said occurred just before 1 p.m., but said they had not eliminated the possibility of terrorism.      “We are looking at all avenues,” George L. Piro, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau’s Miami division, said at a briefing Friday night. “We have not ruled out terrorism and we will be pursuing every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack.”      Piro also said that the shooter, identified as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago, had voluntarily walked inside an FBI office in Anchorage late last year, and “his erratic behavior” caused concerns, so the agents who interviewed him had Santiago taken by local police to get a mental health evaluation.      The gunman was taken into custody without any incident “almost immediately after the shootings,” Israel said during a news briefing Friday afternoon.      “He’s unharmed,” Israel said. “No law enforcement fired any shots.”      The man in custody was identified earlier Friday by several officials including Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who was told the name by the head of the Transportation Security Administration, according to Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the senator. A federal law enforcement official also confirmed the name to The Washington Post.      Santiago was carrying an Army ID, according to three federal law enforcement officials.      He was a passenger on a flight traveling with a checked gun in his baggage, said federal law enforcement officials, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. The officials said that Santiago had picked up his bag and took the gun into the bathroom to load it before returning to the baggage claim area to begin firing at people.      John Schlicher, a pastor from Ohio who was in baggage claim when the shooting happened, said in a brief telephone interview that the gunman, who appeared to be wearing a blue “Star Wars” T-shirt, said nothing as he fired at people’s heads.      “He was just shooting randomly into the crowd,” Schlicher said during an interview Friday afternoon broadcast on MSNBC. “There were two people to my left and two people to my right who were shot.”      The gunman reloaded and continued firing at people, Schlicher said. When police arrived, Schlicher said his wife tried to administer first aid to a man who had been shot in the head while his mother-in-law tried using her sweater to help another man before realizing he was already dead.      In a brief news conference Friday evening, trauma surgeons at Broward Health Medical Center, located just north of the airport, said they received five shooting victims and two needed surgery. All of the patients were in stable condition, they said. Hospital officials declined to comment on their specific injuries or release their ages and gender, citing privacy rules and the ongoing investigation.      1 of 38 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The scene at the Fort Lauderdale airport after a gunman opened fire View Photos Five people were killed in a shooting at the Florida airport, and several more were injured.

Travelers are allowed to bring firearms with them to flights, as long as the guns are unloaded, locked in hard-sided container and in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Ammunition can generally be placed in checked baggage, but it is prohibited from carry-on luggage, and some airlines do not allow transport of any ammo. Passengers are also required to tell airline employees at the ticket counter that they have a weapon in their checked bag.      Santiago is a U.S. citizen with ties to New Jersey, said two federal officials. Military officials said Friday that the suspected shooter, who they named as Esteban Santiago, was a combat engineer in the Alaska National Guard until August, when he was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions after going absent without leave several times and being demoted in rank to private first class.      He had previously served with the Puerto Rico National Guard, deploying to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011 and earning the Combat Action Badge for personally engaging enemy forces. In 2013, he was discharged from the Puerto Rico National Guard with the rank of specialist.      According to federal law enforcement officials, his visit to an FBI office in Anchorage late last year prompted authorities to believe he may have mental health issues.      Santiago went to the FBI office to report something and was expressing some incoherent thoughts, officials said. When he was interviewed by agents, he said he thought the federal government was after him and trying to control him, according to officials recounting the visit. Officials also said he told the FBI that the CIA was forcing him to watch Islamic State propaganda videos to control his mind.      The FBI then contacted local authorities, who took Santiago to undergo a mental health evaluation, Piro said. After interviewing Santiago’s relatives and conducting other reviews and checking with other agencies, the bureau closed its assessment of Santiago.                  Though there had been some early reports that Santiago traveled to Florida from Canada, the Canadian Embassy in Washington said he had not been on a plane traveling from that country. Instead, they said he had flown from Alaska to Florida, with a stop in Minnesota.      “The suspect did not fly from Canada and was not on a Canadian flight,” Christine Constantin, a spokeswoman for the embassy, said in a statement. “We understand from officials he was on a flight originating in Anchorage, transiting through Minneapolis and landing in Ft. Lauderdale. There is no Canadian connection.”      Delta declined to comment on reports that Santiago had been on one of the airline’s flights, but did acknowledge it was working with investigators.      At Anchorage’s Ted Stevens International Airport, Police Chief Jesse Davis said Santiago, who traveled alone, flew from Anchorage to Minneapolis and from there to Fort Lauderdale. He checked in for Delta flight 1088 four hours before flight, Davis said.      “Everything appeared normal,” he said. “He didn’t call attention to himself at all. Our officers didn’t have any contact with him.”      Davis stressed that it was common for someone to check a weapon in Anchorage. “It is not unusual to have passengers check weapons in and out of Anchorage. It’s a big hunting state, so we get it quite a lot of that.”      Davis said authorities in Anchorage are reviewing airport security video footage in an attempt to track Santiago’s activities before the flight.      Another flurry of nervous activity erupted at the airport later Friday afternoon when there were reports of additional gunfire, but Israel said there was no evidence of a second shooting. Police had said shortly before 3 p.m. that they were searching the airport following “unconfirmed reports” of additional gunfire, but Israel said there was “no second active shooter” and no additional victims.

Police and FBI agents were interviewing the suspected gunman Friday afternoon, according to law enforcement officials.      In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, no possible motive emerged for this latest spasm of gun violence in a crowded, public place. Piro, the FBI agent, said federal authorities were aiding local law enforcement “until we make a determination on the nature and motive of this.”      A federal law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said that the gunman did not appear to say anything during his first interactions with police suggesting a political or terrorism-related motive, though the official said it is still early in the process.      The shooting took place in the baggage claim at the airport’s Terminal 2, home to departures and arrivals for Delta and Air Canada, according to the airport. Footage from the scene inside the building captured the brutal aftermath of the shooting in the baggage area, which is on the airport’s lower level. (Warning: This footage is graphic.)      \\"I sat next to her on the plane,\\" a stunned woman says while walking by victims of a shooting on Jan. 6 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

(The Washington Post)      Jay Cohen was dropped off at the airport for a flight, and he arrived after the gunfire had already stopped, finding an unusual scene at the usually bustling facility.      “The airport was like a ghost town,” Cohen, 51, a consultant, said in a telephone interview. “I didn’t see anyone around.”      It wasn’t until he walked all the way up to the Delta counter without encountering a line or a single soul that he noticed about 20 people huddled together behind a nearby concrete wall. He peeked over the counter and saw the Delta employees on the ground trying to cover their heads with their hands.      “Hurry up get behind here,” someone whispered to him. “Active shooter! Active shooter!”      As he looked around the terminal he previously thought was abandoned, he now could see people hiding under benches, squished up against windows. Then Cohen saw police running full speed through the terminal, some with guns drawn, others with their hands on their holsters, while police cars began screaming up to the curb.      “It went from eerie quiet from when I walked in to pure mayhem in just minutes,” he said. “It was chaos.”      A hotline for information about Friends & Family at #FLL is available: 866-435-9355.

Julio Cesar, 48, had just arrived from a trip to Cuba with his wife and three children. The family had picked up their luggage when they heard screaming and airport officials escorted them to a waiting area secured by police.      “In my 25 years in this country, this is the first time I’ve lived through anything like this,” Cesar, 48, a Miami resident, said in a telephone interview late Friday afternoon. “We’re still stuck in here, waiting to get out.”      Passengers dragging suitcases continued to trickle down roadways near the airport through the afternoon. Mark Cobb said he was checking in for a United Airlines flight to Denver when he and his family heard screaming.      “It was crazy,” he said. “The ticketing agents were screaming and cryin.”      Many at the airport expressed frustration with the lack of information Friday. Hundreds were stranded on the tarmac and not allowed off the premises for hours as authorities sought to clear the airport, looking for other danger.      Sophia Macris, 35, on her way to vacation in Florida, was still on her just arrived plane from New York when the shooting occurred.      “They held our plane on the tarmac,” she said in an interview, still standing on the tarmac outside the terminal. “First, they told us there was fire alarm in terminal 2. Then they said emergency situation.”      After the shooting, dozens of cars had pulled over onto the shoulder of nearby Interstate 595, as hundreds of people waited alongside the highway, family members and friends repeatedly trying to call loved ones who were scheduled to be on arriving flights.      Saintnatus Adition was pacing along the highway, police cars racing past with sirens blaring. His 71-year-old father had just landed from Haiti when the chaos began. “He called and said it got very busy all of the sudden,” Adition said. He’s been frantically calling him to find out if he’s okay, but now he can’t reach him. “Of course I am very scared,” Adition said. “He is very old.”      It was after 6 p.m. when Adition finally heard from his father. “I was so happy,” he said. “He told me he’s okay.” But his father was still in the airport at 7:30 p.m., waiting in a terminal, unsure when he would be able to leave.      All flights were suspended following the shooting and the airport was closed, officials said. The airport had initially posted on Twitter about “an ongoing incident” at the baggage claims in one of the terminals, but did not provide further information.      Shortly after 7 p.m., the airport said that passengers who had vehicles there were being allowed to leave, though they said the public was still not allowed inside.      \\"We have the shooter in custody. He's unharmed. No law enforcement fired any shots,\\" the Broward County Sheriff said after at least five people were killed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. (Reuters)      Officials at other major airports across the country, including those in Los Angeles and Chicago, said they were beefing up security in response to the shooting in Florida.      President Obama was briefed on the situation at Fort Lauderdale on Friday afternoon and will be updated as new information is available, according to Ned Price, spokesman for the National Security Council.      “This is a senseless act of evil,” said Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), who traveled to the airport to make his latest public remarks in the aftermath of a shooting rampage in his state.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Associated Press)      FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The Latest on the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport (all times local):      3:35 p.m.      A county official says the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter pulled a gun out of a checked bag, loaded in a bathroom and started shooting, killing five people and wounding at least eight.      Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner, was briefed on the airport shooting by Broward Sheriff's office. He told The Associated Press by phone that the shooter was a passenger on a Canadian flight and had checked a gun.      LaMarca says the shooter pulled out the gun in the bathroom after claiming his bag.      Sheriff Scott Israel says the gunman was not harmed and that law enforcement did not fire any shots. He says it is not yet known if the shooting was an act of terror.      Israel also says there was nothing to substantiate reports of a second shooting at the airport.      ___      3:15 p.m.      A passenger says he heard the first gunshots as he picked up his luggage from a baggage claim carousel in a shooting at a Florida airport that left five dead and eight wounded.      John Schilcher told Fox News the person next to him fell to the ground Friday. He says other people started falling, and he then dropped to the ground with his wife and mother-in-law. Schilcher says \\"the firing just went on and on.\\"      He says the shooter emptied his weapon and reloaded during an eerily quiet lull in the gunfire. Schilcher says he didn't assume it was safe until he saw a police officer standing over him at the Fort Lauderdale international airport.      He says he remained on the ground and was told not to move as authorities investigated unconfirmed reports of a second shooting.      ___      3 p.m.      Officials say there have been unconfirmed reports of additional shots fired at the international airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after a gunman killed five people and wounded eight there.      On Friday afternoon, the Broward County sheriff's office said on its Twitter account: \\"Active search: Unconfirmed reports of addt'l shots fired on airport property.\\"      Earlier in the afternoon, the shooting stopped all traffic at the airport. Passengers were evacuated from the terminal 2 baggage claim area. Passengers returned to the airport as officials said the lone gunman was in custody. But TV reports showed some passengers evacuating again, several looking panicked and ducking behind cars or hiding.      Witness Judah Fernandez told CNN he heard what he believes were the first shots, re-entered the airport, but then rushed out again shortly later to the tarmac. He said: \\"Everyone's running now.\\" He said both security officials and passengers were running.      ___      2:50 p.m.      U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson says the Fort Lauderdale airport gunman was carrying a military ID with the name Esteban Santiago, though it's not clear if it belonged to him or to someone else.      Nelson did not spell the name for reporters during a news conference Friday. Nelson says the baggage claim area is a \\"soft target.\\" The airport had initially reported an \\"incident\\" in the baggage claim area.      Authorities say five people were killed and eight wounded in the shooting.      Nelson says a motive still hasn't been determined.      ___      2:30 p.m.      Authorities say five people were killed and eight were wounded after a lone suspect opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, international airport.      The Broward County Sheriff's Office tweeted the information following Friday afternoon's shooting.      Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief told CNN that authorities \\"have an active crime scene investigation involving terminal 2.\\"      News stations showed video of medics taking care of a bleeding victim outside the airport. Helicopters hovering over the scene showed hundreds of people standing on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by and numerous law enforcement officers, including tactical units, rushed to the scene.      Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tweeted that he was at the airport when shots were fired and \\"everyone is running.\\"      ___      1:50 p.m.      Authorities say multiple people have died after a lone suspect opened fire at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, international airport.

Santiago, who was carrying military identification, appears to have acted alone. The motive for the attack remains unclear and terrorism has not been ruled out. Santiago was detained and placed in federal custody. Santiago had served with both the Alaska National Guard and the Puerto Rico National Guard, but left the military in 2016, having been demoted.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was a central figure in the development of rockabilly? ?  Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \\"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label\\", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as \\"essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction\\": \\"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\\". In \\"That's All Right\\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \\"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \\"rockabilly's originator\\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \\"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \\"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\\" In Moore's view, too, \\"It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\\"At RCA, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher, more intense manner. While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard \\"Blue Moon\\" at Sun to the country ballad \\"How's the World Treating You?\\" on his second LP to the blues of \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a million seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.

My dining partner also received a steak that was more rare than the medium-rare he had requested. Additionally, the ambiance was far from comfortable. The lighting was stark and the air conditioning made the restaurant uncomfortably cold, which marred any enjoyment I might have had from the experience.

GOP 2012 Hopeful Huntsman: We've Got to Cut Out the 'Cancer' of the Debt, Obama Has Failed to Lead This is a rush transcript from \\"On the Record,\\" July 28, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: First, he was pull of praise, calling President Obama \\"remarkable.\\" Now, he says the president is reckless. That is a switch. What happened? Candidate for president, former Utah governor, and former U.S. ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman. JON HUNTSMAN, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the Boehner plan is the only act in town and it is sound given any other alternative. It cuts and allows us to meet our obligations. And most importantly it begins to meet our budget. I think it would be terribly important for this country. And it also envisions looking at a competitive tax code longer term and that is terribly important for the overall competitiveness in the country. The Boehner plan gets us short term to be where we need to be and gets the issues queued up to begin discussing them seriously. Also, I have to say, Greta, that discussing the extent of the cuts and where we need to be during the 2012 election is a very important thing that the country should be doing. VAN SUSTEREN: The Boehner bill is a two-part process. Now, the spending cuts dollar for dollar and then down the road start looking at other expenses which is where the fight will be over entitlements. I think, a lot of the Tea Party think we need to start now and this is a Band-Aid, not a solution. HUNTSMAN: This is what people hate about Washington. The fact that something this important to our well-being and overall economic competitiveness [is] delayed until the 11th hour. The president has shown no leadership and doesn't have a plan on the table. My opponents in the race haven't even come up with what they support. VAN SUSTEREN: Governor Romney, you made a comment about him. HUNTSMAN: It's true. You've got to stand up. Time when leadership matters and stand up and voice where you are. We are kind of at the 11th hour. This is crunch time and this isn't academics or theory. This is the real world. We need to meet our obligations as 25 percent of the worlds I worlds if GDP and leading financial center in the world. That is important number one. Number two, getting cuts. We've got to get on with this cancer that has taken over this country. We need to cut it out and radiate it and excise it. This cancer has taken over the country and we need to do something about it. And the Boehner at least begins that process of cutting that I think is terribly important. And these larger issues that we all need to get serious about, competitive tax code and budget reform. Get them in the queue so they can be discussed during the election year. That is to our advantage. VAN SUSTEREN: You talk about the president's leadership and may have tweeted at one time [that] talking about the debt ceiling referred to I think the with word \\"reckless.\\" How do you reconcile, in 2009, you wrote a letter to him saying he was remarkable. What happened did you lose faith in him? HUNTSMAN: He was starting his administration. I was raised to be a gracious person. I thought it was remarkable that he put a Republican in his administration. VAN SUSTEREN: They all do. HUNTSMAN: Not in a position U.S. ambassador to China. I thought this was remarkable. VAN SUSTEREN: President Clinton put in Cohen at secretary of defense. HUNTSMAN: He puts in a Republican. High hopes and high tax expectations. Sadly today we don't have the leadership. VAN SUSTEREN: It's a big extreme going from remarkable to reckless. HUNTSMAN: It is where we are in the economy. He failed to deliver on the most important issue of our time and that is the economy and the creation of jobs. We are flat-footed and in neutral. And we have more confidence in where it company is going. Nobody it putting capital expenditures in their business because they can't see around the bend and what healthcare reform and financial services reform is going to cost them. We need to get the regulatory monkey off our back and get on with things like energy independence. VAN SUSTEREN: When you were governor you had to deal with a balanced budget amendment in your state? HUNTSMAN: We not only had that but we had the most significant tax cut in the history of our state. VAN SUSTEREN: Would you like to see a balanced budget amendment on the federal level? HUNTSMAN: I think it is the most important thing we could do. I think having that safeguard and that standard at the federal level is a very, very important thing for this country. When you build a budget as governor you do so with the idea in mind you are presenting it to your legislature in balanced form and for this nation that would be a similarly wise thing to do. VAN SUSTEREN: That is not in the Boehner bill. That's going to be a separate stand alone. A lot of people are critical of the fact it is not in the Boehner bill and instead the Boehner bill has caps and people are cynical when it comes to caps because caps this Congress and then two Congress escaped down the road, what caps? HUNTSMAN: Everybody has the expectation we will move towards a balanced budget amendment. This is a no-brainer and must be done. People are fed up with where we are financially, 14.3 trillion in debt. This cancer has got to be cut out. And one of the most important and powerful tools getting us there is a balanced budget amendment. VAN SUSTEREN: Should we be worried about the August 2 deadline or is that politicians scaring us? And secondly, even with the Boehner will sounds like we will be downgraded anyway. So does that factor into your thinking. HUNTSMAN: The market is going to react as we do. The markets are going to react as they will. But listen, it is important to maintain our triple-a rating in this country. We have done so for almost 100 years. VAN SUSTEREN: But the very people who gave the triple rating to the toxic CDOs, and so it's peculiar that the AAA rating we are trying to keep are from the very people that kind of put it us in this mess. HUNTSMAN: I understand, but that is separate. We are talking about maintaining a AAA rating. We are one of the few states that maintained our tripping a rating. This affects every family in this country. We had to work hard to maintain our triple a status. VAN SUSTEREN: But we're making our AAA standing with an organization that frankly has failed us so poorly before that it is sort of hard for me to think that they are the ones that I should care about. I realize the whole world economy looks to them, but there is something wrong with this picture. HUNTSMAN: There is something wrong with this picture, but it is the way it works right now and it is what is going to give the seal of approval and stamp of approval on where we are financially and that has an impact o on the overall cost of capital. To the extent that affects every family in this country it becomes an issue. August 2 is a deadline and we need to take that deadline seriously.

The isotope is unstable: Due to the surplus of protons, the strong nuclear force in the nucleus can't effectively counterbalance the electrostatic repulsion between protons, rendering the isotope unstable. 3. The isotope emits radiation: In an attempt to regain stability, the unstable isotope undergoes radioactive decay, a process in which it emits radiation in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma particles. 4. The isotope decays: As a consequence of radioactive decay, the isotope undergoes a transformation. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: During decay, atomic particles (including protons, neutrons, or electrons) can be ejected from the nucleus to help stabilize it. 6.

PUBLISHED:. 18:11 EST, 20 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:11 EST, 20 October 2012. Earning power: Bradley after winning the Tour de France. Olympic gold medallist and Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins is slashing his tax bill by using an offshore scheme branded ‘abusive’ and ‘artificial’ by the Treasury. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the seven-time Olympic medallist, hot favourite for 2012 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax. The 32-year-old cycling hero who climbed to the top of his sport partly thanks to Lottery funding, earned an estimated £5 million this year. He has joined a complex tax-avoidance partnership, Twofold First Services, which takes advantage of farming tax reliefs. But the Treasury has taken action to close the loophole and the taxman last night pledged to ‘investigate and challenge’ any arrangements put in place before the change in the law. Twofold is controlled by another company, Twofold Partnership  Management, based in the Cayman Islands tax haven. But the firm believed to have set it up, York-based Tax Trade Advisors, is also linked to NT (‘No Tax’) Advisors, the firm criticised for similar schemes involving comedian Jimmy Carr and Coronation Street star Bill Roache. Roache is also a member of Twofold, along with Wiggins and 230 other rich investors. How much  Wiggins invested is not clear, but his spokesman insisted it involved only a ‘small percentage’ of his income and the ‘vast majority’ of his earnings were taxed at the higher rate of 50 per cent. Sources say the cyclist paid more than £1 million in tax last year. Companies House records show Wiggins joined Twofold on March 13 this year. On the same day, the Treasury issued a strongly-worded press release referring to an ‘abusive’ tax avoidance scheme’ without naming it. Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said it had shut down a ‘contrived’ scheme being marketed at the time, and that it would challenge any  others put together before March 13. ‘The scheme  .  .  .  used artificial transactions to generate tax relief from a property business that owns agricultural land,’ said the Treasury at the time. Involved: Actor Bill Roache, posing for a snap with his partner Emma Jesson. Taken for a ride? The seven-time Olympic medallist has joined a partnership that will save him thousands in income tax. ‘Although the land itself and the. business owning it will exist, the transactions are not part of any. genuine agricultural business. They are generated only to create an. artificial loss that can be set off by users  .  .  .  to reduce their. tax bill.’ In a. Twofold-type scheme, an individual could end up paying no tax at all, by. investing around £100,000 yet claiming tax relief on £1 million. This is achieved as each £100,000 is supplemented by a £900,000 loan taken out by the partnership. That money, after being paid to the farmer, is swiftly repaid to the bank. The accountants find a way to artificially ‘write down’ the investment to become a loss on paper, even though there was no cash loss. The original £100,000 goes to the advisers and banks in fees, but the partnership members claim they have made a loss of £1 million, which they set against their income. Tax haven: Twofold is controlled by another company, Twofold Partnership Management, based in the Cayman Islands (pictured) Last night an HMRC spokesman, referring to the unnamed March 13 scheme, said: ‘HMRC reacted very quickly when this scheme was disclosed and Ministers announced a change to the legislation within days. 'This protected the Exchequer by shutting down a scheme that was being marketed at that time. HMRC will challenge any schemes of this type which were implemented before the announcement.’ A spokesman for Wiggins said: ‘The vast majority of Bradley’s income is taxed at the standard and higher rate. The investment in Twofold Services involves only a small percentage of Bradley’s income. Bradley has paid, and will continue to pay, his fair share of tax.’ Roache and NT Advisors declined to comment. Tax Trade Advisors could not be reached for comment.

Kevin Patrick Smith was born on August 2, 1970 in Red Bank, New Jersey, the son of Grace (nee Schultz), a homemaker, and Donald E. Smith, a postal worker. He has an older sister, Virginia, and an older brother, Donald Smith, Jr. He was raised in a Catholic household, in the nearby clamming town of Highlands. As a child, Smith's days were scheduled around Donald's late shifts at the post office. After the success of his first films, Smith lived in Los Angeles, though he disliked no longer being near his New Jersey friends. He dated actress Joey Lauren Adams, and declared his desire to marry her in Time magazine, but they began to grow apart after he spoke of staying in Los Angeles permanently and starting a life with her. When Smith's grandmother became ill, he returned to Red Bank and remained there, realizing that that was where he belonged. Smith and Adams' relationship was tested by their working together on Chasing Amy, the set of which saw a heated argument between the two. They broke up in June 1997.  Smith is married to Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, whom he met while she was interviewing him for USA Today. They got married at Skywalker Ranch on April 25, 1999. He photographed her for a nude pictorial in Playboy that consisted of photographs by various celebrities. Their daughter, Harley Quinn Smith, was born June 26, 1999, and was named after the character from the Batman comics. They live in the Hollywood Hills, in a house Smith purchased from longtime friend Ben Affleck in 2003.  Initially raised Catholic, Smith began to develop doubts about his beliefs in his early 20s, and came to see Catholic Mass as \\"dry and lip-servicey.\\" Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith read extensively on Christianity, explored other religions, read the Biblical apocrypha, and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film Dogma, the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended Mass as late as 1998, he stated on \\"Back to the Well\\", a feature on the Clerks II documentary, that now he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a film, and the day before it premieres. Nevertheless, Smith told the BBC in September 2014 that he firmly professes a belief in God. He said, \\"Proof of God is that I have a career.\\"  Smith is an avid hockey fan and loyal New Jersey Devils fan. He is also a fan of the Edmonton Oilers.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Arizona's New Immigration Law: Cops vs. CopWatchers Maricopa County Sheriffs frisk a suspect during an operational sweep on July 29. Mark Ralston / AFP / Getty Images Arizona's SB1070 is now law but, gutted of the provisions that made it a national controversy, it is a remarkably toothless instrument for policing, despite the huff and guff of anti-illegal-immigration hardliners like Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County (which includes Phoenix), who did not postpone scheduled sweeps through Latino communities. Indeed, for all the hype of Arpaio's \\"Crime Suppression/Illegal Immigration Operation\\" on Thursday, the day the law went into effect, he and his deputies arrested only three undocumented people. By contrast, on Wednesday nearly 90 illegal immigrants were arrested in a two-part sweep in Virginia and Washington, D.C. What vaporized from Arizona's new immigration law were stipulations that law enforcement could require proof of immigration status from people they have stopped for questioning. The original version would have made it a state crime not to carry documentation; and it would have let police arrest undocumented immigrants if they were found seeking employment in a public space. If Arpaio were armed with all of that, the likelihood is that he would have detained a large number of people. In his 16 prior operations, nearly 1,000 suspected violators were arrested, 60% of whom were undocumented immigrants. This time, out of about 40 people the Sheriff's office apprehended Thursday, only a handful  just 7%  were illegal immigrants. (See pictures of immigration detention in Arizona.) But there may have been other reasons the numbers were low, apart from the temporary injunction blocking the most contentious parts of the law. Some officers said the desert monsoon weather dampened the operation. Another factor may well have been Lydia Guzman, a prominent Hispanic activist, who, along with a group called CopWatch, designed a detailed messaging system to warn the Phoenix Valley of immigration sweeps. Guzman sent an initial text blast to 100 rapid response teams of business owners, Spanish radio stations, pastors and teachers, each of whom messaged their respective networks. At the same time, Guzman contacted lawyers, social workers and elected officials to be at the ready to help. \\"It spiderwebs out,\\" she says. \\"Before you know it my text tree spreads out to thousands of people.\\" (Is the \\"dangerous border\\" actually one of America's safest places?) Sheriff Arpaio has called her out for undermining his work. \\"The Sheriff has even accused me of putting coyotes [the popular name for operators of people smuggling rings] on text tree,\\" she told TIME. \\"But number one, they don't live here and, number two, a lot of smugglers are the ones we want put away. They are the ones who hurt our people.\\" (See pictures of the Great Wall of America.) In addition to Guzman's tweets, CopWatch visibly tails police operations. On Thursday, in one small West Phoenix mobile command center, members of CopWatch monitored police communications. \\"They just said '294 King'  that means immigration. Let's go,\\" cried one member listening to the police scanners. And with that CopWatch activists grabbed cameras, lawyer contacts and car keys to follow Arpaio's sweep. Sheriff Arpaio has been tweeting as well. A few messages sent to his followers and the press from Thursday: \\"Just got a report that protesters are now trying to block my downtown jail sallyport and are chaining themselves to the jail\\"; \\"Just finished up with protesters at the jail, we will now resume our operation\\"; then immediately after, \\"I'm heading over to 4th Ave Jail to see what's going on w/ protesters around the jail.\\" The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office arranged for nearly 45 media crews to trail along with the patrols. Sometimes, it seemed that Arpaio's media strategy got in the way of his own operation: his deputies had to delay the crime sweep to enable Arpaio to give a press conference at the jail where protesters chained themselves across the main booking entrance. \\"He can't stay away from the camera,\\" says CopWatch activist Dennis Gilman. \\"We successfully disrupted his sweep, because all his deputies were down there dealing with the protesters.\\" See TIME's Pictures of the Week.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices.

Since there is no effect when a number is multiplied by 0, the equation can be simplified to: 103*g - 5600 = -37*g 2. Move all terms with g to one side of the equation: To do this, we will add 37*g to both sides of the equation. 103*g + 37*g - 5600 = -37*g + 37*g This simplifies to: 140*g - 5600 = 0 3.

To achieve this, add 5600 to both sides of the equation. 140*g - 5600 + 5600 = 0 + 5600 This simplifies to: 140*g = 5600 4.

Write a summary based on this article: AFP Copyright: AFP      The claim of the lorry attack in Berlin by so-called Islamic State (IS) does not prove much in terms of the attack. The group often refers to individuals who carry out attacks as its \\"soldiers\\" but the crucial question is firstly whether the individual had any form of direct contact with IS.      Face-to-face or online communication are possible but far from certain. If there was no direct contact, it could still be the case that an individual was inspired rather than directed by the group.      In this case, an individual may leave his or her own pledge of allegiance in written form or online or in a video.      But until such evidence emerges, it remains hard to know if this is just an opportunistic claim by the group rather than one based on real substance. ||||| Firefighters attend an injured person after a truck ran into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. Police said that several people have been killed. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) (Associated Press)      Firefighters attend an injured person after a truck ran into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. Police said that several people have been killed. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) (Associated Press)      BERLIN (AP) — Police said Tuesday that the driver who rammed a truck into a crowded Christmas market in the heart of the German capital, killing at least 12 people and injuring nearly 50, did so intentionally and that they are investigating a suspected \\"terror attack.\\"      The truck struck the popular Christmas market filled with tourists and locals outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church near Berlin's Zoo station late Monday.      \\"Our investigators are working on the assumption that the truck was intentionally driven into the crowd at the Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz,\\" Berlin police said on Twitter.      \\"All police measures concerning the suspected terror attack at Breitscheidplatz are being taken with great speed and the necessary care,\\" they said.      Numerous German media reported that the suspect, who was picked up about 2 kilometers (1½ miles) from the crash site, was a Pakistani citizen.      Footage showed the suspect, his head covered in a white sheet, being pushed into a police car shortly after the attack.      Berlin's public radio station RBB-Inforadio cited security sources saying the man entered Germany on Dec. 31, 2015. News agency dpa, also citing unnamed security sources, said he came to Germany as a refugee in February 2016. Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the man was known to police for minor crimes.      Police declined to comment on the reports, referring questions to federal prosecutors who said they would hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon.      A spokesman for Berlin's office for refugee affairs said police conducted a large-scale search overnight at a large shelter for asylum-seekers at the city's now-defunct Tempelhof airport overnight. Four men in the late 20s were questioned but nobody was arrested, Sascha Langenbach told The Associated Press.      Among the dead was a man in the truck, who succumbed as paramedics treated him, Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said. Police said later that the man was a Polish national, but didn't give further details of who he was or what happened to him.      The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \\"They must have done something to my driver,\\" he told TVN24.      In the immediate aftermath of the attack German officials were cautious in characterizing what had happened. \\"I don't want to use the word 'attack' yet at the moment, although a lot speaks for it,\\" Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told ARD television late Monday. \\"There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation.\\"      Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed.      Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants.      Far-right groups and a nationalist party seized on Monday's attack, blaming German Chancellor Angela Merkel for what had happened.      \\"Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,\\" Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party, wrote.      Manfred Weber, a member of Merkel's conservative party and leader of the European Parliament's biggest political grouping, cautioned against sweeping verdicts but said it was important to ensure that extremists didn't enter the country.      \\"The state must be able to check every refugee who comes here,\\" he told German public broadcaster ARD.      French Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux expressed his sympathy after the attack.      \\"We are all Berliners today,\\" he told Europe-1 radio Tuesday. \\"In this type of situation, we need unity to face down terrorists, and on this occasion we need European unity. It must be strong, particularly strong.\\"      The White House condemned \\"what appears to have been a terrorist attack.\\" It came less than a month after the U.S. State Department warned that extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \\"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events\\" in Europe.      The Islamic State group and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France.      Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ready to help in the investigation and response.      U.S. President-elect Donald Trump Islamic extremists must be \\"eradicated from the face of the earth\\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \\"freedom-loving partners.\\"      Berlin's mayor, Michael Mueller, planned to hold a news conference on the attack at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT). The archbishop of Berlin, Heiner Koch, said he would hold prayers for the victims at the St. Hedwig Cathedral at noon.      ___      Associated Press writers David Rising and Geir Moulson in Berlin and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in Berlin, after a driver ploughed a lorry through a crowded Christmas market in the centre of Berlin.      At least 12 people died in the alleged attack, while almost 50 others sustained injuries. The driver fled the scene, but police say they have arrested a suspect they believe was at the wheel. The passenger in the vehicle died at the scene.      The incident was reminiscent of an attack in Nice, France, when a lorry driver drove through a crowded outdoor celebration for Bastille Day on 14 July. Isis later claimed responsibility for the attack, calling the truck driver a “soldier”.      Follow the latest updates here      But the motivation behind Monday’s deadly episode remains unclear.

Berlin (CNN) German authorities released a man and intensified their manhunt for the person who plowed a tractor-trailer truck into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market , even as ISIS claimed Tuesday that it inspired the attack.      Police said they didn't have enough evidence to hold a man they'd earlier described as a suspect in the Monday night truck assault that left 12 people dead and 48 injured. The dead include a man found shot inside the truck.      There may be more than one suspect at large, armed and dangerous, Peter Frank, general prosecutor at Germany's Federal Court of Justice, told journalists.      The ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency released a statement saying Monday night's attack was carried out by \\"a soldier of the Islamic State\\" in response to calls by the group's leadership to target citizens of international coalition countries.      CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said ISIS often uses this terminology to refer to attacks by alleged sympathizers in the West.      \\"This should not be taken to mean the group is claiming it directed this attack,\\" Cruickshank said. \\"Investigators have not uncovered any links to ISIS.\\"      German authorities are investigating the attack as an act of terror. Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists that we must \\"assume this is a terrorist attack.\\"      Latest developments      Prosecutor: Forensic tests haven't confirmed man was in truck's cabin.      Mourners pack nearby church at memorial for victims.      Officials say several people could have been involved in the attack.      A weapon used in the attack has not yet been found.      Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the site where 12 people died.      Attacker at large?      Berlin police called on the public to remain alert as confusion swirled over who was driving when the truck barreled over a curb into the crowded market.      \\"They're really back to square one in terms of this investigation. ... It may well be a scenario of a manhunt, a race against time to arrest this individual before they can strike again,\\" Cruickshank said.      German authorities released the man they'd detained after the attack. \\"The results of the investigation thus far have not produced imminent suspicion against the accused,\\" the general prosecutor said in a statement.      Investigators had initially described the asylum seeker they detained as a suspect. But a day later, they seemed to be backing off that claim.      \\"We possibly need to assume that we have not arrested the right one,\\" Frank said.      \\"We do not know if there was one perpetrator or several perpetrators yet. We do not know if there was support given to the perpetrator.\\"      Authorities didn't release the identity of the man they detained. De Maiziere said earlier that the man was \\"probably from Pakistan.\\" He entered Germany on December 31, 2015, Interior Minister Thomas De Maiziere said, and his application for asylum had stalled.      So far, forensic tests haven't linked the man to the truck's cabin, the prosecutor said.      Berlin police turned to the public for help and tweeted that they'd received 508 leads. Police also asked citizens to upload any digital video and photos of the incident or possible suspects.

The sounds of a choir singing rang out as a terrorism expert spoke to CNN near the market.      \\"You have peace concerts, you have people laying down wreaths, you have people writing cards and people speaking silent prayers. This is completely unprecedented,\\" said Peter Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization. \\"I don't think a lot of people are aware there's an attacker on the loose, potentially.\\"      Those unable to enter the packed building waited outside in the winter air, many hugging each other, crying, or silently clutching candles.      Polish citizen found dead      Police identified the man found shot to death inside the truck as the original driver from Poland, reported German state media ARD.      He was not driving when the truck came through the market, police said. The gun has not been recovered, De Maiziere said.      The truck, which was owned by a Polish company, \\"was steered deliberately into the crowd,\\" police said. It was carrying 25 tons of steel, according to Ariel Zurawski, the owner of the truck company. Zurawski told CNN affiliate TVN 24 the vehicle may have been hijacked.

I, like millions of people in Germany, am horrified and deeply sad about what happened yesterday in Berlin.\\"      German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to give a statement the day after the Berlin attack.      Monday's attack could cause further political upheaval for Merkel, who has come under criticism over her government's generous acceptance of refugees. Germany has taken in more than 890,000 asylum-seekers in the past year, a much higher number than other European nations.      But a backlash has been growing, fueled in part by Islamist terror attacks in Germany and across the continent.      World leaders, including US President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, expressed support for Merkel and the German people.      'It felt like slow motion'      Before the attack on Monday evening it was a quintessential German Christmas scene at Breitscheidplatz: Trees strung with lights, vendors serving candied fruit and waffles, the smell of gluhwein -- German mulled wine -- wafting through the cold December air.      Authorites inspect a truck that sped into a Christmas market in Berlin.      American Shandana Durrani was at the market, at the foot of the Keiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, and had stopped to reply to a text message when the truck rammed into the crowd at around 8 pm.      She was lucky to have stopped, she said, as the truck mounted the curb, mowing people and stalls down just 20 feet in front of her, sending everyone \\"running, scurrying, screaming.\\"      \\"I heard some popping and thought maybe there was a guy with a gun,\\" she told CNN.      \\"People just started running and dropping their gluhwein.\\"      View of the truck that crashed into a Christmas market at Gedächtniskirche church in Berlin.      She said that it looked as if the driver had just mounted the curb and lost control, and that the whole thing probably lasted a mere 10 seconds.      \\"It probably didn't last very long, but it felt like it was in slow motion (as I ) tried to get away from it.\\"      Security concerns      De Maiziere said that Christmas markets would be closed Tuesday for a day of mourning. \\"But to cancel them would be wrong,\\" he said, adding they would hopefully reopen the following day.      Münch, of the Federal Criminal Office, said that authorities had assessed the likelihood of an attack at Christmas markets recently.      Security officers guard the area after the Berlin Christmas market attack.      The attack is similar to one in Nice, France, in July, when a truck rammed into a crowd gathered to see Bastille Day fireworks, killing 86 and injuring more than 200 people      Terror groups including ISIS and a branch of al Qaeda have encouraged their followers to use vehicles to stage attacks      The US and UK governments had warned their citizens of potential security threats in Germany. ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Police have been patrolling other Christmas markets across Germany such as this one in Frankfurt      The German authorities say they cannot be sure if a man in custody was behind Monday's lorry attack on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people.      \\"We have to entertain the theory that the detainee might possibly not have been the perpetrator,\\" federal prosecutor Peter Frank told reporters.

A bystander had been tracking the driver of the lorry after seeing him jump out of the cabin, and had led police to the suspect.      Special forces on Tuesday stormed a hangar at Berlin's defunct Tempelhof airport, where they believed he had been living in a shelter with other migrants.      Police are examining a mobile phone they seized during the search there.      Who was the first known victim?      The usual driver of the lorry, Polish citizen Lukasz Urban, was found dead on the passenger seat of the lorry, reportedly with gunshot and stab wounds to his body. No gun was recovered.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process you described is known as weathering, which is the breakdown of rocks, soil, and minerals into smaller particles known as sediment. Weathering occurs through various physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that work together to disintegrate and decompose rocks and other geological materials. Physical weathering, also called mechanical weathering, involves the process of breaking down rocks and minerals through physical forces such as freezing and thawing, temperature fluctuations, pressure release, and abrasion. For instance, water can seep into the cracks in rocks, and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rock to break apart. Alternatively, rocks can also undergo mechanical weathering through temperature fluctuations, causing them to expand during the day when it's warm and contract at night when it's cold, eventually leading to the disintegration of the rock. Chemical weathering occurs when rocks and minerals are altered or dissolved due to the direct or indirect interaction with various chemical agents such as water, acids, or oxygen. In this process, the original rock minerals are either changed into new minerals or are dissolved completely, altering the composition of the rock. Examples of chemical weathering include the process of oxidation, which forms rust on rocks with high iron content, or carbonation, where acidic rainwater reacts with carbonates in rocks, causing them to break down. Lastly, biological weathering is the process by which living organisms, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, contribute to the breakdown of rocks and geological materials. For example, plant roots can penetrate the cracks in rocks, exerting pressure and causing the rock to break apart. Similarly, organisms like lichens, mosses, and fungi produce acidic substances that can dissolve minerals in the rocks, leading to their disintegration. In summary, the first step of the sediment transportation process you described is weathering, which involves the physical, chemical, and biological breakdown of rocks, soil, and minerals into smaller particles known as sediment. This process sets the stage for sediment pickup, transportation, and deposition by agents such as wind or water, which move the sediment to new locations and contribute to the continuous cycle of erosion and sedimentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But I can use this background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

Paul studied the Gaia hypothesis, which is directly about the Earth as a self-regulating system that tends to achieve a stable state (homeostasis). The example provided about the carbon dioxide levels further demonstrates the stable state concept intrinsic to the Gaia hypothesis. Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which primarily deals with the relationships between space and time, the effects of gravity, and the behavior of objects in motion, rather than a stable state in Earth's ecosystem.

He was a direct descendant of Jesse de Forest, the leader of a group of Walloon Huguenots who fled Europe in the 17th Century due to religious persecution. De Forest's father was a Congregational Church minister who hoped his son would also become a pastor. In 1879 the elder de Forest became president of the American Missionary Association's Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, a school \\"open to all of either sex, without regard to sect, race, or color\\", and which educated primarily African-Americans. At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Valdemar Poulsen had presented a paper on an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady \\"continuous wave\\" signals that could be used for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. Although Poulsen had patented his invention, de Forest claimed to have come up with a variation that allowed him to avoid infringing on Poulsen's work. Using his \\"sparkless\\" arc transmitter, de Forest first transmitted audio across a lab room on December 31, 1906, and by February was making experimental transmissions, including music produced by Thaddeus Cahill's telharmonium, that were heard throughout the city.  On July 18, 1907, de Forest made the first ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone -- race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association (I-LYA) Regatta held on Lake Erie -- which were sent from the steam yacht Thelma to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox's Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island. De Forest also interested the U.S. Navy in his radiotelephone, which placed a rush order to have 26 arc sets installed for its Great White Fleet around-the-world voyage that began in late 1907. However, at the conclusion of the circumnavigation the sets were declared to be too unreliable to meet the Navy's needs and removed.  The company set up a network of radiotelephone stations along the Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes, for coastal ship navigation. However, the installations proved unprofitable, and by 1911 the parent company and its subsidiaries were on the brink of bankruptcy. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he make anything else","output":"Yes, Lee de Forest made numerous contributions to the field of telecommunications. One of his most famous inventions was the Audion (later named \\"triode\\") vacuum tube, which played a significant role in the development of electronic technology.

In the text, it is mentioned that Lee de Forest made \\"the first ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone.\\" This was a significant achievement, as it showcased the potential applications for radiotelephone technology in various fields, including maritime communication. Additionally, his \\"sparkless\\" arc transmitter enabled him to transmit audio across a lab room and make experimental transmissions of music, further contributing to advancements in amplitude-modulated (AM) audio transmissions.

Fact 2: Earthquake tremors and volcanic activity are frequent.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what causes tremors?\\" with the following options:  - tectonic plates coliding  - fissures of hot, acidic water  - sensory neurons  - energy of moving objects  - Thyroid-stimulating hormone  - storms  - the sun  - richter scale Answer:","output":"Tremors, or the shaking that occurs during an earthquake, are primarily caused by tectonic plates colliding. This option is most consistent with the given facts, which include that tectonic plates being pushed together causes earthquakes (Fact 1) and that earthquake tremors and volcanic activity are frequent (Fact 2). Tectonic plates are vast, solid slabs of rock that make up the Earth's lithosphere, which is the rigid outer layer of our planet. These plates are in constant motion, interacting with one another at their boundaries due to the convective motion of the underlying asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is a partially molten layer of the Earth's mantle that allows tectonic plates to move around. There are three main types of interactions between tectonic plates: convergent boundaries, where plates move towards each other; divergent boundaries, where they move apart; and transform boundaries, where they slide horizontally past each other. Tremors predominantly occur at the first type of boundaries, known as convergent boundaries, where tectonic plates are being pushed together. These collisions lead to a buildup of stress and strain within the Earth's crust, which ultimately becomes too much for the rocks to withstand. When this happens, the energy is released in the form of seismic waves, resulting in an earthquake's characteristic shaking or trembling motion. This shaking can occur at varying intensities, depending on factors such as the earthquake's magnitude, depth, and the type of rocks and soil present in the affected region. In summary, tremors are mainly caused by the collision of tectonic plates at convergent boundaries. The other options listed - fissures of hot, acidic water; sensory neurons; energy of moving objects; Thyroid-stimulating hormone; storms; the sun; and the Richter scale - are not directly related to the causes of tremors and earthquakes. Some of these options may be associated with other natural phenomena or even with the measurement and study of earthquakes, but they do not contribute to the occurrence of tremors themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, it also gives information about the manager of the club Al-Zawra'a SC. Ahmad Kadhim Assad is associated with two football clubs. First, he is connected with Esteghlal Ahvaz F.C. This football club is based in Ahvaz, a city in the southwest of Iran, and it competes in the Iranian Pro League. The club has been deemed a vital part of the city's sports culture and maintains a steady fan base locally. Being a member of the club, Ahmad Kadhim Assad assumes a significant role in its activities, although the exact nature of this role - such as a player, a coach, or other staff position - is not specified in the data. Secondly, Ahmad Kadhim Assad is also tied to Al-Zawra'a SC, a renowned football club situated in Baghdad, Iraq. Al-Zawra'a SC enjoys immense popularity due to its successful run in the Iraqi Premier League, the highest tier of Iraqi football. Ahmad Kadhim Assad, being associated with this club as well, suggests that he possesses noteworthy dexterity or professional aptitude relevant to football. However, without explicit details about his role in this club, it's challenging to categorize his specific involvement. Lastly, the data provides insight into the management structure of Al-Zawra'a SC. This club is managed by Basim Qasim. The role of a manager in a football club is critical as they shoulder the responsibility of team performance, player management, and strategy formation. Since Basim Qasim is highlighted as the manager, he likely plays an integral part in the successes and faults of the team. He must align the club's objectives with the resources at hand, making necessary decisions related to players, training, and match strategies to achieve the club's goals. Presumably, Basim Qasim would maintain a continuous interaction with all associated with the club, including Ahmad Kadhim Assad, indicative of their professional relationship. This outlined data, although brief, presents a multifaceted view of Ahmad Kadhim Assad's involvement in the football realm across two distinct clubs, along with his probable professional interaction with managers such as Basim Qasim. Perhaps, with more detailed information, a comprehensive analysis of his contribution to these clubs and their respective successes could be generated."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste?  The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a  tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation.

Santorum endorsed Rubio on Wednesday. Santorum can't name any of Rubio's Senate accomplishments      Rick Santorum had one job to do in his appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Thursday. He failed.      The former Pennsylvania senator, who dropped his presidential bid Wednesday, told co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski he is supporting Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign because the Florida senator is someone “who can work together with people.” But Santorum struggled to name one accomplishment Rubio has had in the Senate.      Story Continued Below      “He’s been in the Senate for four years,” Scarborough noted. “Can you name his top accomplishment in the Senate — actually working in the Senate doing something that tilted your decision to Marco Rubio?”      “If you look at being in the minority in the United States Senate in a year when nothing got — four years where nothing got done, I guess it’s hard to say there are accomplishments,” Santorum said. “I mean, tell me what happened during that four years that was an accomplishment for anybody? It was complete gridlock.”      Scarborough shot back that Republicans have been in the majority for the past two years and asked what Rubio has accomplished there since being part of the majority. “Joe, look, the Republicans have been in the majority for one year and one month, of which, as you know, he was running for president primarily,” Santorum said. “The first four years he was in the minority, and nothing got done. And by the way, what happened this year under the Republicans?”      Scarborough insisted he wasn’t defending Congress or being difficult in his questioning. “I’m just asking you to name one accomplishment that Marco Rubio —” Scarborough said as Santorum tried to interrupt. “But list one accomplishment. Just one. Just one that Marco achieved. Maybe a bill that he wrote. Maybe a moment in a committee.”      Brzezinski then jumped in to make it easier on Santorum, offering a fill-in-the-blank question. “Jeb Bush ran Florida. Donald Trump built a company,” she began. “Marco Rubio... — finish the sentence.”      “OK, Marco Rubio was, No. 1, the speaker of the Florida House, which is not something that’s a minor deal,” Santorum answered. “I mean, he was elected by his colleagues to be the speaker of the House. No. 2, yeah, he spent four years in the United States Senate being frustrated like everybody else that nothing got done, and then you can’t point to him and say well nothing got done and therefore he has no accomplishments.”      That argument is “bogus,” Santorum said, slamming the “feckless Congress.”      “It’s actually not a bogus argument,” Scarborough said. “All I’m asking is a simple question. I’ll ask it one more time, and don’t attack me because we’ve been friends for a very long time.”      “No, no, no, let me ask the question one more time,” Scarborough said as Santorum tried to interrupt. “List one accomplishment that Marco Rubio has achieved in four years in the United States Senate. It doesn’t even have to be a passed bill.”      “Well, I know he included something that went after the insurance companies in the most recent omnibus. I know that he fought for that to stop bailing out insurance companies,” Santorum said. “That’s one thing that I’m familiar with that I just saw recently, but — and again, he was on the campaign trail and accomplished that. The bottom line is there isn’t a whole lot of accomplishments, Joe, and I just don’t think it’s a fair question.”      Since the 2010 elections, when Scarborough appeared to back Rubio’s opponent, Charlie Crist, relations have been frosty. Rubio has refused to go on the show, and Scarborough frequently bashes Rubio on air. A source familiar with Thursday’s appearance said Santorum would have been dissuaded from appearing had upper-level campaign staff known about it.      “He took a s---,” one Rubio insider said of Santorum’s appearance.      Rubio defended Santorum later Thursday, emphasizing that the former Pennsylvania senator had endorsed him only a day ago. “Rick just signed onto the campaign, so obviously he's working with us and, you know, we'll have to continue to work on telling our story,” Rubio said on Fox News. “And obviously Rick’s going to be a big part of doing that. I'm proud of what I've done in public service.”      Eliza Collins and Marc Caputo contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Rubio, under sharp criticism from former Florida Gov.

Marco Rubio is defending his record in Congress after Rick Santorum, now a Rubio backer, struggled to name any legislative accomplishments by the Florida senator.

Chris Christie, downplayed Santorum's inability to name a single legislative accomplishment of his.      \\"Let's be fair to Rick. I mean, he has spent the past year and a half running for president and his campaign, and he just endorsed us last night,\\" Rubio told reporters in Manchester on Thursday.      Rubio then vaguely said he had \\"real achievements,\\" and repeated his arguments that he's shown \\"better judgment\\" on national security issues than his rivals.      Earlier Thursday, Santorum, who ended his presidential campaign earlier this week after fairing poorly in the Iowa caucuses, said \\"it's hard\\" to name a significant accomplishment that Rubio has had in the Senate. He did say that Rubio has \\"tremendous potential and gifts.\\"      Read More ||||| Asked repeatedly to name a single one of Sen. Marco Rubio’s accomplishments while serving five years as a U.S. senator representing Florida, Rick Santorum – who just endorsed the GOP lawmaker after bowing out of the presidential race himself on Wednesday – struggled to come up with any during an appearance Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”      Santorum floundered right off the bat when asked to list Rubio’s “top accomplishment” while in office. “Well, I mean, I would just say that this is a guy who’s been able to, No. 1, win a tough election in Florida and pull people together from a variety of different spots. This is a guy that I think can work together with people,” he said. “That’s the thing I like about him the most.”      Yet host Joe Scarborough didn’t ask which personal quality of Rubio’s Santorum liked the most. He asked for just one standout accomplishment – so he pressed the former Pennsylvania senator again: “So he can win, but he’s been in the Senate for four years. Can you name his top accomplishment in the Senate, actually working in the Senate doing something that tilted your decision to Marco Rubio?”      RELATED: Republican field narrows as Iowa caucus knocks out candidates      Santorum danced around the question for a second time, concluding that “I guess it’s hard to say there are accomplishments” when a junior senator is working in a government “where nothing gets done.”      “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski called the exchange with Santorum “disturbing.”      Meanwhile, Scarborough brought up the fact that Republicans have been in the Senate majority for the past two years, and asked for a third time: “Can you name one thing that he’s passed in the last two years?” eventually pleading with Santorum to “like one accomplishment – just one, just one – that Marco achieved.”      Santorum then blamed President Obama for Rubio’s lack of accomplishments in the Senate, saying “he spent four years in the United States Senate being frustrated like everybody else that nothing got done, and then you can’t point to him and say nothing got done and therefore he has no accomplishments. The problem is we have a president who doesn’t work with people.”      Eventually, however, Santorum did offer an example of a Rubio achievement, albeit a vague one.      “Well, I know he included something that went after the insurance companies in the most recent omnibus. He fought for that, to stop bailing out insurance companies. That’s one thing I’m familiar that I just saw recently, ” he said. “But – and again, he was on the campaign trail and accomplished that. The bottom line is there isn’t a lot of accomplishments, Joe, and I just don’t think it’s a fair question to say.”      A Rubio aide asked by NBC to comment on Santorum’s struggle to come up with an accomplishment simply offered a list of examples of legislation Rubio passed and signed into law in recent years, including VA accountability reform and Obamacare bailout. The aide had not yet seen the interview.      In his endorsement Wednesday, Santorum called Rubio a “born leader” who represents ”the new generation” during an appearance on the Fox News program “On the Record With Greta Van Susteren.” The former senator decided to suspend his campaign just days after the Iowa Caucus – the third Republican to do so this week.      New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who joined “Morning Joe” later in the hour, used Santorum’s interview to his advantage, saying flatly, “Rubio hasn’t accomplished one thing in his career.”      The presidential candidate then listed off some of his own accomplishments, adding, “and Rick Santorum can’t name one thing Marco Rubio’s done. I will tell you one thing Marco Rubio’s done – he’s made it very clear on the issue of pro-life – Marco Rubio is not for an exception for rape, incest or the life of a mother. Now, you know, I think that’s the kind of position that New Hampshire voters would be really concerned about.”      Donald Trump’s campaign manager was eager to jump on Santorum’s interview as well, retweeting the “Morning Joe” video early Thursday morning. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"During an interview with MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' on Thursday, Rick Santorum, who recently endorsed Marco Rubio, struggled to name an accomplishment of Rubio in the Senate.

Seeking a solution to this recurring problem, a multi-million pound sat-nav project has been launched, aiming to put an end to these scenarios by providing accurate, real-time information to drivers, enabling them to navigate more efficiently and safely. Step One: Understanding the Problem Before diving into the details of the project, it's essential to understand why lorries and other large vehicles frequently get stuck in narrow lanes and under low bridges. Factors such as drivers relying on outdated maps, inaccurate sat-nav systems, and lack of proper signage contribute to these incidents, leading to costly damages and frustrating traffic problems. Step Two: Introducing the Multi-Million Pound Sat-Nav Project To combat these issues, the multi-million pound sat-nav project focuses on developing an advanced, accurate, and up-to-date routing system specifically designed for lorries and other large vehicles. This system will take into account the size and weight of the vehicle, ensuring that the suggested route avoids any roads or bridges where the vehicle may encounter difficulties.  Step Three: Incorporating Real-Time Information  A crucial aspect of the project will involve the integration of real-time data, such as ongoing road works, traffic congestion, and recent infrastructure changes. This information will be collected through various sources, including connected vehicles, road sensors, and data from other drivers, allowing the sat-nav system to create an optimal route for the driver based on the vehicle's dimensions and current road conditions. Step Four: Ensuring Ease of Use and Accessibility Understanding that any solution is only useful if it's user-friendly, the project aims to create a sat-nav system that is easily accessible and straightforward to use. The interface will operate on a range of platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and in-vehicle systems, ensuring that it caters to the needs of a diverse range of users. Step Five: Monitoring and Updating the System As with any innovative project, ongoing monitoring and improvements will be vital to secure the success of the multi-million-pound sat-nav system. Regular updates to the software will assure that the latest data is always available to drivers, while constant evaluation of the system will ensure that any glitches or shortcomings are swiftly addressed. Conclusion The multi-million pound sat-nav project aims to revolutionize the lorry and large vehicle navigation experience, significantly reducing the number of incidents involving stuck vehicles in narrow lanes and under low-lying bridges. By providing drivers with accurate, real-time data and an easy-to-use platform, this cutting-edge technology promises a safer, more efficient, and less frustrating future for everyone on UK roads."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gifford was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Lola Mae (nee Hawkins) and Weldon Gifford, an oil driller. He graduated from Bakersfield High School. Following Gifford's death in 2015, his wife Kathie Lee Gifford said that her late husband grew up in a poverty-stricken home and that he and his family sometimes ate dog food. She said they lived in 29 places even before Gifford attended high school because his father could not find work during the Depression. After his playing days ended, Gifford became a broadcaster for CBS, covering football, golf and basketball. When Monday Night Football was launched in 1970, ABC had originally planned to have Gifford in their broadcast booth, but he still had a year remaining on his contract with CBS. He therefore recommended his friend Don Meredith, who was hired. The following year, Gifford replaced Keith Jackson as Monday Night Football's play-by-play announcer, and remained involved with the show for 27 of its next 28 years. His low-key delivery provided a perfect counterbalance to broadcast partners Meredith and Howard Cosell. In an era with only three television broadcast networks, the series became the longest-running prime-time sports program in television history, and developed into one of television's most valuable franchises. In 1986, Al Michaels took over play-by-play duties, and Gifford switched to a commentator role. However, Gifford did play-by-play for the next several years (Gifford was joined by Lynn Swann on color commentary in 1986 and by Dan Dierdorf for the rest of his run on Monday Night Football) whenever Michaels was covering post-season baseball games for the network.  Following his affair with airline flight attendant Suzen Johnson in 1997, Gifford was replaced in the broadcast booth by Boomer Esiason in 1998. That season, he was reassigned to a nominal role for ABC's Monday night pregame show, but the program was cancelled after one season. Gifford was not offered a new role by the network. Gifford was also host of British TV network Channel 4's NFL coverage with British born former New England Patriots kicker John Smith in 1986, which included coverage of Super Bowl XXI.  Gifford was also a reporter and commentator on other ABC sports programs, such as coverage of the Olympics (including the controversial men's basketball Gold Medal game between the United States and Soviet Union at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, which Gifford called alongside Bill Russell), skiing and golf. He announced Evel Knievel's jumps for ABC's Wide World of Sports in the 1970s, including when Knievel failed to clear 13 buses at Wembley Stadium in 1975. Gifford also guest hosted Good Morning America on occasion, including once when he met his future wife Kathie Lee.  In 1977, Gifford won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality. He was given the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame In 1995 for his NFL television work.  Monday Night Football paid tribute to Gifford on September 14, 2015, by having ESPN announcers Mike Tirico and Jon Gruden wear the gold jackets that Gifford helped make famous as a broadcaster.

This will offer a comprehensive perspective on the issue and display potential solutions or strategies taken by police forces or local administrations to handle the issue.  Step 4: Expert opinions and recommendations To showcase the urgency of this issue, citing expert opinions and recommendations will help to further emphasize the potential consequences and best practices. This could include officials from law enforcement, criminology experts, or public safety authorities. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, we must reiterate that decreasing police recruitment in Derbyshire and Warwickshire is a pressing issue that can negatively impact public safety and security. Collaborative efforts between local communities, authorities, and experts are necessary to address this issue and ensure that adequate law enforcement presence is maintained. The need to execute both short-term and long-term strategies to boost police recruitment must be a priority to protect the community's safety and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She drops another penny on a golf course and it doesn't roll anywhere. The golf course has (A) more resistance (B) less resistance  Choose the answer between \\"golf course\\" and \\"parking lot\\".","output":"The correct answer is \\"golf course\\". To elaborate on the answer, let's examine the factors that determine the rolling distance of the penny in both the parking lot and the golf course.  1. Surface roughness: A rough surface provides more resistance and friction, making it harder for objects to roll or slide. In this case, a parking lot is usually made of concrete or asphalt which is a relatively smooth surface. On the other hand, a golf course is covered by grass, which is rougher and creates more resistance. When the penny rolled on the golf course, the grass fibers provided more friction, leading to a significant reduction in the rolling distance. 2. Slope: A sloped surface can affect the rolling distance. If the penny were dropped on a sloped parking lot, it might roll farther due to the additional force of gravity. In contrast, a golf course often has a more leveled or even, undulating terrain, which may prevent the penny from rolling too far away or even stop it from rolling at all. 3. Presence of obstacles: The presence of obstacles can greatly affect the rolling distance. In a parking lot, there may be fewer obstacles compared to a golf course, which may have divots, bumps, or undulations in the terrain. These factors would obstruct the path of the penny on the golf course, causing it to stop rolling sooner than it would on the parking lot. To sum up, when comparing the parking lot and the golf course, the latter has more resistance due to the roughness of its surface, the potentially more leveled or uneven terrain, and the possible presence of more obstacles that hinder movement. This is why Santana's penny didn't roll anywhere on the golf course, while it rolled far away when dropped in the parking lot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their blowout loss at Green Bay, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers took the early lead in the first quarter, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos grabbed the lead, when cornerback Cassius Vaughn returned an interception off Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers 55 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers responded, with a 32-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos extended their lead in the second quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would re-claim the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown run by Rivers, a 28-yard field goal by Novak, followed by a 42-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, giving San Diego a 23-10 halftime lead. The Broncos benched quarterback Kyle Orton in favor of Tim Tebow. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chargers added to their lead, with a 51-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos responded, when Tebow scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown (with a two-point conversion run by running back Willis McGahee), then threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), to pull the Broncos to within 26-24 with just over three minutes left in the game. The Chargers responded, with a 35-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos tried to rally with 24 seconds remaining in regulation, but Tebow's last-second desperation pass into the end zone was unsuccessful, sealing the win for San Diego.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals - Acid rain in fog at higher elevations can strip foliage off trees.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people are more environmentally responsible happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis of people becoming more environmentally responsible would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on reducing the damage caused by acid rain. If individuals and industries adopt eco-friendly practices and technologies, the resulting reduction in harmful emissions will affect the entire process of acid rain formation and its impact on ecosystems. Here is a detailed explanation of the potential changes that may occur in the process of acid rain formation and how they could lead to less damage: 1. Reduction of harmful emissions: Environmentally responsible people are more likely to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint and the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. This can be achieved by using cleaner energy sources like renewable energy, implementing energy-efficient technologies, and adhering to stricter environmental regulations. With fewer emissions of SO2 and NOx, the formation of acid rain will be significantly reduced. 2. Less aluminum leaching from soil: As the overall amount of acid rain decreases, its ability to leach aluminum from clay particles in the soil is also reduced. This means that there will be less aluminum flowing into streams and lakes, decreasing its toxic effects on aquatic life. 3. Preservation of soil minerals and nutrients: With less acid rain, there will be a reduced dissolution of minerals and nutrients in the soil. This helps in retaining the essential elements required for plant growth and conserving soil fertility. Consequently, plants will have better access to the nutrients they need, leading to optimal growth and reproduction. 4. Stabilization of soil and water pH: As acid rain decreases, there will be lesser impacts on the pH levels of both soil and water. This helps in maintaining a healthier environment for plants and animals, ensuring their growth and survival. Reduced acidification of water bodies also supports aquatic biodiversity by providing suitable conditions for various species to thrive. 5. Reduced damage at higher elevations: With people being more environmentally responsible, there would be less SO2 and NOx emissions. In turn, the amount of acid rain in fog at higher elevations will decrease, reducing the risks of foliage stripping off trees. Preserving tree canopies is crucial for supporting ecosystems, as they provide habitat and food sources for a diverse array of species. 6. Indirect effects: When people become more environmentally responsible, they are likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, such as tree planting, habitat preservation, and supporting policies aimed at reducing pollution. These activities bolster the resilience of ecosystems and help repair the damage caused by acid rain in the past. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of people becoming more environmentally responsible has a significant impact on reducing the damage caused by acid rain. By limiting the emissions of acid rain precursors, adopting sustainable practices, and supporting environmental initiatives, society can help restore and protect ecosystems, ensuring their health and vitality for future generations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks.

Question: What did Richard Owen do for a living? Context: The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871). Answer:","output":"Richard Owen was an anatomist and a leading naturalist in Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why does Tina run from the cabin? Movie plot title: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Movie plot: As a young child, Tina Shepard witnesses her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa. Michael's cousin Nick, who has arrived just for the party takes a liking to Tina, much to the jealousy of Melissa, who bullies Tina. Tina tells Nick about Jason and has a vision of Jason murdering Michael. Meanwhile, Jason kills Michael in real life, along with Jane, and later kills another couple camping in the woods. While Tina goes off to find her mother and Nick goes with her, Jason proceeds to kill the other teens. Russell is killed with a hatchet to the face, and Sandra is pulled underwater while she is skinny-dipping. Jason stalks Maddie and kills her in the barn with a scythe, and then crushes Ben's skull with his bare hands before shoving a party horn...

Described as doting parents, Scarpelli ran the Madison Wellness Center and his wife worked as the receptionist. The business had recently closed, the Daily Mail reports, and the couple was reportedly in deep debt, facing multiple tax liens. Scarpelli was sued in federal court for failing to pay back a student loan and owed about 123,000 to the feds and 42,000 to the state in unpaid taxes since 2003, per the Mail. The couple’s children attended an elite high school, and both enrolled in private colleges. Last year Joseph praised his parents in a school speech, saying they “repeatedly told me that I could wake up one day and lose everyone I love, but no one will ever be able to take away my faith.” A crowd-funding page was set up to aid the children's education.

Shortly before their deaths, Glenn and Patricia closed down the Madison Wellness Center, where Glenn worked as a chiropractor and Patricia as a receptionist. According to sources, the couple was burdened by a significant amount of debt, including numerous tax liens.

Background: The Colbert Report () is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. Context: The New Yorker wrote that \\"Colbert has made vital observations about the American political system, particularly about the sordid role that money plays within it. The Colbert Report and the Daily Show [...] have changed the way that young liberals of a certain class think and talk about civic culture.\\"  The show also coined another word, wikiality, that means \\"reality as decided on majority rule.\\" Viewers of the show also coined a word, freem, based on its inclusion in the show's opening sequence; the word refers to \\"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything -- without any responsibility or action.\\" In response to the \\"Better Know a District\\" segment, Rahm Emanuel, then the Democratic Caucus chair, instructed incoming freshmen not to do appearances on the show in 2007. In 2008, East Carolina University associate professor Jason Bond named a species of trapdoor spider Aptostichus stephencolberti in honor of Stephen Colbert.  The \\"Colbert Bump\\" is defined, connotatively by the Report, as an increase in popularity of a person (author, musician, politician, etc.) or thing (website, etc.) as a result of appearing as a guest on or (in the case of a thing) being mentioned on the show. For example, if a politician appears on The Colbert Report, they may become more popular with certain voters and thus are more likely to be elected. According to the American Political Science Association, contributions to Democratic politicians rose 40% for 30 days after an appearance on the show. Magazines such as GQ, Newsweek, and Sports Illustrated have all had sales spikes when Colbert appeared on their covers.  Viewers of The Colbert Report were on numerous occasions cited as being more knowledgeable about current events than traditional news viewers. In April 2007, a Pew Research Center report cited both Colbert and The Daily Show viewers as more well-informed than those who gathered their information via newspapers, television news and radio. Colbert's Super PAC coverage was widely lauded, and studies later found that this coverage was more effective than traditional news programs at educating the audience on campaign finance. He was awarded a Peabody Award for the parody, which was described as an \\"innovative means of teaching American viewers about the landmark court decision\\". The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported in 2014 that the Colbert Super PAC segments increased viewers' knowledge of PAC and 501(c)(4) campaign finance regulation more successfully than other types of news media. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are other interesting aspects in the article. Some of them include: 1. The Colbert Report not only satirized conservative political talk programs but also made significant observations about the American political system, particularly regarding the influence of money. 2. The show introduced the concept of \\"wikiality,\\" which means \\"reality as decided on majority rule.\\" 3. The term \\"freem,\\" meaning \\"'freedom' without having to 'do' anything -- without any responsibility or action,\\" was coined by the viewers of the show. 4. The \\"Colbert Bump\\" refers to an increase in popularity of a person or thing as a result of appearing on or being mentioned in The Colbert Report. 5.

For instance, Colbert's Super PAC coverage was more effective at educating the audience on campaign finance than traditional news programs. 6.

Act Two: Preserving the Peace As Kulkov familiarizes himself with the facility, he begins to learn more about the prisoners he is tasked with guarding. Among them are Artyom Mironov (35), a brilliant political strategist suspected of war crimes; Yelena Petrova (30), a maverick hacker wanted by numerous governments; and Mikhail Ivanov (40), a powerful arms dealer with blood on his hands. At first, tensions rise as the prisoners clash with each other and test the limits of their captor. Kulkov remains firm and disciplined, keeping the volatile group in check and under his constant watch. Over time, he starts to sympathize with their individual plights and becomes increasingly conflicted about his role in their detainment. Meanwhile, the warring factions in the country begin to close in on the facility, growing increasingly desperate to obtain the prisoners for their own agendas. Kulkov must rely on his wit and combat skills to fend off attacks from all directions. He is constantly on edge, stretched beyond his limits, defending the camp and the valuable prisoners inside it.  Act Three: At The Crossroads Following a series of relentless skirmishes, Kulkov uncovers a shocking conspiracy behind the prisoners' detainment. He learns that his private military employers have been orchestrating events behind the scenes to prolong the civil war—using the intelligence possessed by the prisoners to manipulate and destabilize the country for their own financial gain. Torn between duty and his struggle with the truth, Kulkov defies orders and makes the life-altering decision to set the prisoners free. However, as he works in secret to create an escape plan, the final battle approaches, with both rival factions converging on the abandoned facility. In the heat of the intense firefight, Kulkov leads the group to an underground tunnel, and they make their daring escape. As the facility burns around them, Kulkov shares a final, heartfelt farewell with the prisoners, reflecting on their newfound respect for each other and the sacrifices he has made. Epilogue: Redemption As Kulkov and the prisoners part ways, a renewed sense of purpose drives him to turn his back on his former employers and expose their corruption. He decides to use his skills for good, working anonymously behind the scenes to restore peace and stability to the war-torn region. The film ends with Kulkov vanishing into the shadows—a firm but unassuming guardian, no longer a lone warden, driven by a quest for redemption and determined to make his sacrifices mean something."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of these would most likely improve the air quality in large Texas cities? Choices: [-] Limiting the number of cars on the roads [-] Switching to wood stoves for home heating [-] Requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel [-] Maintaining filters in large buildings","output":"I will compare each choice and analyze their potential effects on improving the air quality in large Texas cities step by step: 1. Limiting the number of cars on the roads: Limiting the number of cars on the roads would lead to a reduction in vehicle emissions, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. This, in turn, would decrease the levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, leading to improved air quality. 2. Switching to wood stoves for home heating: Wood stoves typically produce more smoke and emit more particulate matter than other heating options, such as natural gas or electric heating systems. Consequently, increasing the use of wood stoves could worsen air quality in large Texas cities. 3. Requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel: Diesel fuel generally contains more energy per gallon than gasoline, which allows diesel-powered vehicles to have better fuel economy. However, diesel engines emit higher levels of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides than gasoline engines. By requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel, air quality could worsen because of the increase in these harmful emissions. 4. Maintaining filters in large buildings: Properly maintained filters in large building HVAC systems can help remove dust, allergens, and other particles from the air, but their impact on the overall air quality outside the building is limited. The improvement in air quality due to maintaining filters would be mostly confined to the indoor environment. Based on this analysis, the choice of \\"Limiting the number of cars on the roads\\" would most likely improve the air quality in large Texas cities, as it directly addresses the reduction of vehicle emissions, which are significant contributors to poor air quality."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Fred was a good athlete in his youth, and so was Vic.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the set of songs that Alan Gibbs believes is at least equal to Vaughan William's Five English Folk songs of 1913? from the following article ?  During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the...

Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

However, the following evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal abuse of the work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote \\"The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than the picture of the stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end.\\" The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux \\"at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor\\". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was \\"something like a hostile reception\\" at the first London performance, the final performance in the season \\"was received with scarcely a sign of opposition\\". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.Monteux believed that most of the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as \\"knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down\\". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914.

During an unsuccessful honeymoon at a holiday camp Reggie becomes alienated from the brassy and self-absorbed Dot. Afterwards, they begin to live increasingly separate lives as Reggie becomes more involved with his biker friends, especially the eccentric Pete (Dudley Sutton). Reggie also loses interest in having sex with Dot. When Reggie's grandfather dies, Dot merely complains that his support for his bereaved grandmother (Gladys Henson) has stopped them visiting the cinema. Her boorish behaviour at the funeral and her refusal to move in with Reggie's grandmother leads to a major argument. She leaves and Reggie stays with his gran, who will not leave her own house. He brings in Pete, who has been forced to leave his lodgings, to stay as a lodger with her. The two share a bed at her house. Meanwhile Dot shows an interest in Brian (Johnny Briggs), another biker. The following day Pete and Reggie drive to the seaside. Reggie wants them to chat up a couple of girls, but Pete shows no interest. Reggie intends to return to Dot. Dot herself has already hatched a plan to get him back by pretending to be pregnant. Dot is sitting with Brian when she tells Reggie of her \\"pregnancy\\".

Given the question \\"How would you describe Kendall?\\", is \\"feeling passive\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"It is not entirely accurate to describe Kendall as \\"feeling passive\\" based solely on the information provided about their magic trick. First, let's dissect the details available and then consider a more appropriate description of Kendall. Kendall performed a magic trick around the world, which has left the audience puzzled and unable to figure out the secret behind the trick. This demonstrates a few potential characteristics of Kendall: 1. Skilled magician: To create a magic trick that baffles people around the world, Kendall must possess a high level of expertise in the field of magic. This indicates a commitment to mastering their craft and a strong understanding of illusion and deception techniques. 2. Creative and inventive: Developing a unique and complex magic trick suggests a creative and innovative mindset. Kendall must be capable of coming up with novel ideas and implementing them effectively. 3. Ambitious and adventurous: Taking the magic trick around the world reflects Kendall's ambition and willingness to showcase their talents on a global stage. This implies a certain level of confidence and determination in their abilities. 4. Mysterious and enigmatic: Since the trick has left people unable to figure it out, Kendall projects an air of mystery. They have likely cultivated this image intentionally to create intrigue and generate interest in their performances. In contrast, the term \\"feeling passive\\" doesn't seem relevant as a valid description of Kendall. Passivity generally refers to a lack of action, engagement, or interest. In this context, Kendall's actions are far from passive. They are actively engaging with audiences through their magic trick, stimulating curiosity and sparking wonder across the world. However, it's important to acknowledge that we don't have any information about Kendall's internal emotions or feelings. They may feel passive in other aspects of their life or feel uninterested in certain topics, but this is not reflected in the details given about their magic trick. To describe Kendall more accurately, it would be appropriate to focus on their skilled, creative, and ambitious nature as demonstrated by their worldwide magic trick phenomenon. In conclusion, \\"feeling passive\\" is not an appropriate description for Kendall based on the information provided. Instead, we can say that Kendall is a skilled, creative, and ambitious magician who has managed to captivate audiences around the world with a mysterious and enigmatic illusion."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing.

Using the caulking gun, Felicia could easily seal and insulate her home, preventing drafts, reducing her energy consumption, and increasing the energy efficiency of her home.

Sentence 1: \\"Sussex and Lancing Colleges are recorded as having played a football match in November 1860, the first by public schools in Brighton.\\" In this sentence, the focus is primarily on the fact that Sussex and Lancing Colleges played a football match in November 1860. The information about it being the first match played by public schools in Brighton serves as additional context. It highlights that this particular match was significant because it marked a historical moment for local schools. Sentence 2: \\"Sussex and Lancing Colleges, which played a football match in November 1860, are recorded as the first of public schools in Brighton.\\" This sentence, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on Sussex and Lancing Colleges being the first public schools in Brighton to have played a football match. The fact that the match took place in November 1860 is added as supplementary information.

Browns opportunity a ‘blessing’ as Robert Griffin III seeks to move on from Redskins drama BEREA, Ohio — The deconstruction of what happened with Robert Griffin III and the Washington Redskins has continued, somewhat unabated, since Griffin’s unceremonious exit from D.C. earlier this offseason when the team released its once-prized quarterback. There is lingering fascination, to some, over what went so right for one glorious season and what went so wrong thereafter, not to mention all the accompanying melodrama involving owner Daniel Snyder and two coaching generations of Shanahans. But if Griffin still cares about how the story is retold and how the blame for the unraveling of his Redskins tenure is carved up, he isn’t saying so. He has landed in what has been a graveyard for NFL quarterbacking reputations. But that’s just fine with him, and Griffin said Wednesday all his energy is devoted these days to trying to capitalize on the chance the Cleveland Browns have given him to reassemble his professional career. [The ‘most dangerous man in football’ traded an NFL career for an internship] “I don’t get wounded by it because I know the truth,” Griffin said at a Browns minicamp. “At the end of the day, I’m blessed with a new opportunity to be here. So I can’t worry about what’s going on back there. I don’t worry about it. I don’t see what comes out. I don’t read the articles. So that’s not my focus. My focus is being a Cleveland Brown, changing the culture here and giving this city something to be proud of. And I can’t do that if I’m focused on the past. So I’m moving forward, been moved forward, focusing on this team.” The Browns signed Griffin after the Redskins released the former NFL offensive rookie of the year. It was a once-unthinkable conclusion to Griffin’s stay in Washington, but one that became increasingly inevitable when his brilliant rookie season was followed by three years of injuries and disappointing play. Now he is attempting to become the Browns’ 25th different starter at quarterback since 1999. “It’s just a blessing,” Griffin said. “Some guys love free agency. Some guys don’t. I hated free agency. I didn’t know where I was gonna be. It was an uncomfortable feeling not knowing if you’re gonna get a chance to play football again. So when the Browns came calling and everyone else did and I had that decision to make, it was a blessing to be able to come here. And you just have to make the most of your opportunity. “There’s a calming feeling about when you know what you’re doing and how to get it done. And having the four years of experience in the league through all the ups and downs gives me that sense of calmness, that sense of peace, to know all I have to do is go out there and play the game that I love.” The Browns have not promised their starting job for 2016 to Griffin, but they have plenty invested in him recapturing his glorious past. Johnny Manziel is long gone. Veteran Josh McCown remains but does not seem like the answer for a rebuilding team. The Browns traded down from the No. 2 overall pick in the NFL draft and did not select a quarterback until the third round, when they chose USC’s unheralded Cody Kessler. [The Browns appear all-in on Robert Griffin III for 2016] It is up to Hue Jackson, the Browns’ first-year head coach, to try to get something positive out of Griffin the way he formerly helped Andy Dalton while serving as the offensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals. “I think Robert can do whatever we ask him to do,” Jackson said Wednesday. “I think he’s demonstrating that every day. I think he’s getting better at some things. … But I don’t have any reservations of anything in our offense that he can’t do. … He’s done well.” It will be up to Jackson to see if Griffin still can summon any of the improvisational magic he had as a Redskins’ rookie. Jackson’s aid will also involve developing Griffin into a reliable pocket passer, a transition Griffin failed to make in Washington while playing for two head coaches, first Mike Shanahan and then Jay Gruden. “Coach said something extremely powerful today,” Griffin said. “He said, ‘This is our offense. It’s not Hue’s offense. It’s not Robert’s offense. It’s not [offensive tackle] Joe Thomas’s offense. It’s our offense and you have to play within that system.’ And I think that’s the beauty of it whether he asks me to play from the pocket, play on the perimeter, run the ball, hand the ball off, whatever it is. Throw it 40 times [or] throw it 20 times — play within the system and then use your God-given ability when the system breaks down to make everything right. And I think that’s been the focus: Play within the system. When it’s not there, make something happen or throw it away.” Other Browns players said Wednesday that Griffin has made a favorable impression so far. “He’s very vocal,” center Cameron Erving said. “He’s very competitive. … He’s always been a confident guy. But he’s definitely getting more comfortable.” Veteran cornerback Tramon Williams said that Griffin has struck him as a hard worker and a coachable player. “I like him,” Williams said. “He has all the tools to be a really good quarterback for us.” Griffin said he has not gone out of his way to try to convince his new teammates what they might have heard about him from his polarizing days in Washington is inaccurate. “I’m not actively trying to do that,” Griffin said. “I think when you hear rumors, whatever, guys are gonna make their own judgment on you by what they see. And the worst thing you can do is try to come in and be somebody that you’re not. … What we say is guys’ BS meters can go off really fast. If you’re BS’ing them, they’ll know you’re BS’ing them. So I haven’t actively tried to do that. … But a lot of the stuff can be extremely false and you can come in and prove to them who you really are. “That’s what the blessing of a new opportunity with a new team, a new organization, has blessed me with a chance to just go out, be myself and let guys make their own determination about who I am.” Griffin spoke Wednesday of devoting more practice-field attention to sliding at the end of a run or throwing away the football while in the pocket to avoid a sack or a hit. Those are things mentioned often by Shanahan early in Griffin’s Redskins career as skills needed by the young quarterback to better safeguard himself as his career progressed. Griffin now is so intent on demonstrating his willingness to throw the ball away when warranted that he sailed a pass or two over the fence surrounding the Browns’ practice fields this week. “Every practice, you have to practice like it’s a game,” Griffin said. “And I think those are two of the things that I didn’t practice enough. I didn’t practice throwing the ball away enough. I didn’t practice sliding enough. So that’s why I slid last week. And that’s why you see me breaking windows out there on the field” by throwing the ball away. Even if he maintains that he no longer pays attention to what is said about his time in Washington, Griffin acknowledges that the lessons of his Redskins tenure could serve him well going forward. “In a short amount of time, about four years, I’ve been through a lot of things in the NFL that guys don’t experience in their entire time,” Griffin said. “So I just try to draw upon those experiences and go out, have fun, play the game, master the process, trust the process and the results will come.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text discuss Robert Griffin III's transition from the Washington Redskins to the Cleveland Browns, his intentions of focusing on the present and giving the city of Cleveland something to be proud of, and how he plans to utilize the lessons learned during his time with the Redskins to improve his performance and decision-making on the field.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\"  Question: \\"Why is the FDA concerned about the e-cigarettes?\\" Answer: \\"Brands\\" Is this answer to the question correct? OPT: A). no; B). yes;","output":"A). No, the answer to the question \\"Why is the FDA concerned about the e-cigarettes?\\" is not \\"Brands\\". The FDA's concern, as detailed in the text, is primarily about the health and safety risks that the devices pose due to the presence of nicotine and other dangerous chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic, in the cartridges of e-cigarettes. Also, the FDA has concerns about how these products are marketed to the public. The challenge is heightened because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, so the agency lacks comprehensive knowledge on the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of chemicals that the various brands deliver to their users."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Fact 1: Aplant requires food for survival.

The Golden State Warriors were aiming for the best win-loss record in NBA history. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs had a 13-game winning streak and were on pace to put up the best point differential the league has ever seen. Monday’s game was hyped as a must-watch event: the Warriors’ unstoppable offense against the Spurs’ impossible defense. Well, the Warriors promptly solved that impossible defense, and basketball fans were treated to yet another Warriors blowout. Golden State demolished San Antonio 120-90. There was very little the Spurs could do. Putting Kawhi Leonard, the reigning defensive player of the year, on Steph Curry only briefly slowed him down. Curry scored 37 points in the game, despite sitting for the entire fourth quarter. Even for those who have enjoyed watching the Warriors embarrass opposing teams, Monday’s game was a disappointment. There was no drama, no suspense, no intrigue. Fans were promised a historic clash. Instead, they witnessed the basketball version of the NFC championship game between the Panthers and the Cardinals. (Curry was playing playing the role of Cam Newton, obviously.) Now, this was only one game, and it may end up being just an aberration. The Spurs were playing at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have yet to lose all season, and without Tim Duncan, who sat out with knee soreness. Although his days as a MVP candidate are firmly in the past, Duncan’s presence would have made a difference, albeit probably not a 30- point one. The two teams next play on 19 March, in San Antonio, with the Spurs potentially at full strength. If the Spurs pull off victory there, or even suffer a close loss, we’ll all go back daydreaming about a seven-game Western Conference finals between the two. But maybe that is wishful thinking. It’s also possible that these Warriors have no rival and will continue to decimate the NBA like an invasive species without a natural predator. This was the second time in two weeks that the Warriors embarrassed one of the teams that supposedly had a shot at knocking them out of the playoffs. Last week, they took on the Cavaliers in what was supposed to be an NBA finals preview. That turned out to be a 34-point road win for the Warriors. That loss spurred a coaching change and questions about whether Cleveland’s LeBron James-Kyrie Irving-Kevin Love super-team was doomed by the Warriors’ mere existence. It’s to the point where the NBA might have a Superman problem on its hands. As many attempted movie adaptations will attest, it’s notoriously difficult to develop engaging stories about Superman, a character so powerful he can do just about anything. It’s difficult to come up with believable scenarios for Superman where there’s any drama or provide him with opponents that represent any realistic danger. Greatness, no matter how impressive, can end up being boring without legitimate conflict. We’re not at that point with the Warriors yet, but Monday night’s win suggests that this rest of this season could end up completely lacking suspense – unless a team figures out what their Kryptonite could be. Not sure what sport this is but it looks amazing pic.twitter.com/xCqoGR1CI7 The Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks couldn’t duplicate this series of ridiculous offensive mistakes if they spent weeks practicing choreography. It’s almost annoying when Kent Bazemore finally makes a shot. I’m not sure if “carried” is right term for this, but the events of the last week certainly have revealed exactly how much weight LeBron James holds within the organization. It’s widely believed that James was instrumental in his team’s decision to replace head coach David Blatt with assistant Tyronn Lue on Friday. Publicly, James had said he was surprised by Blatt’s firing, and maybe he didn’t directly request the change, but nobody believes the team would have make such a drastic move if James were against it. Judging by the reports that followed the announcement, the only real surprise that James could have is in the fact that Blatt lasted as long as he did. If David Blatt’s getting fired, how in the hell do the rest of us have jobs? Because our front offices aren’t quite as crazy as theirs. – Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy on Blatt’s firing. The Notorious SVG has a point. Under Blatt, the Cavaliers had a 30-11 record and was comfortably at the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Most franchises wouldn’t make a change under these circumstances, but most franchises aren’t run by Dan Gilbert. Of course, Van Gundy, of all people, should realize that basketball teams have no shame when it comes to firing head coaches to placate a superstar player. 1. Golden State Warriors (Last week: 1) It’s not entirely the case that the Warriors don’t have a true rival, it’s just that the team they’re playing against hasn’t existed for nearly 20 years. With their Monday night win, the Warriors improved their record to 41-4, tying the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls for the best start in NBA history. At this point of the season, 72-10 seems like a very possible goal. 2. San Antonio Spurs (2) Before Monday’s loss to the Warriors, there was an argument that the Spurs were actually the best team in the NBA despite their less impressive record. Now? Now it would be easier to defend BoB’s claim that the earth is flat. 3. Oklahoma City Thunder (4) The Thunder had a seven-game win streak going until they lost a blizzard-delayed game against the Nets on Sunday. Maybe the Nets should only play on snow days from here on out. Another ripple effect from the Blatt firing? LeBron James is now almost as hated in Israel, where Blatt coached Maccabi Tel Aviv, as he was in Ohio after The Decision. 5. Los Angeles Clippers (5) First, the Clippers steal the Pistons’ move of letting Josh Smith go for nothing. Then comes the news that Blake Griffin will miss significant amount of time after injuring his hand in an “undisclosed team-related incident.” Later rumors emerge that this incident was a fistfight with a member of the equipment staff that began in a restaurant. Other than all that, things have been quiet on the Clipper front. Congratulations Toronto, you’re currently in the weird, nebulous position that is “second best in the Eastern Conference.” Don’t get comfortable: some other team will take your place within the week, if not days. Also, congratulations to Kyle Lowry for rightfully getting voted in as an All-Star Game starter. That’s a much less tenuous achievement. Normally, when a team goes through a coaching change, a team is motivated to make sure their next game is a big win. The Bulls would have none of it, solidly beating the Cavaliers on their home floor in the first game of the post-Blatt era, causing their own fans to turn against them. Remember last year, when nearly the entire Hawks’ starting lineup went to the All-Star Game? This year, there’s a good chance Paul Millsap will be their lone representative when the reserves are announced on Thursday. Speaking of the All-Star Game, did you know that Zaza Pachulia was almost voted in as a starter? It’s true, thanks to the efforts of the entire country of Georgia, a Fugee and a Vine celebrity. Also: did you know that Vine celebrities can influence popular voting now and that this is absolutely terrifying on a wide variety of levels? Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace says he won’t be “compelled” to make a move before the trade deadline. Translation: he knows they have no shot of beating the Warriors, Spurs or the Thunder in the playoffs. The Rockets, breaking new ground in their mission to make basketball as painful to watch as possible, intentionally fouled Andre Drummond 21 times during a loss to the Detroit Pistons. “Hey, Mr Riley, this is Ray Allen’s lawyer. If you continue to call my client, we will have no other option but to take out that restraining order we’ve talked about.” The Spurs’ loss on Monday means that, improbably, the Pistons remain the last team to beat the Warriors. Anonymous, confidential message to Danny Ainge: “Give Avery Bradley anything and everything he wants, my heart cannot take him leaving. Sincerely, HF.” The Pacers lost to the Warriors by a mere 12 points last Friday, which clearly means they’re objectively a better team than both the Spurs and the Cavaliers. Kemba Walker won Eastern Conference player of the week honors and has a small but non-zero chance of making the All-Star Game. All of this is confusing. While the Warriors and Spurs were playing what was supposed to be the game of the century, the Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins was busy scoring 56 points against the Hornets. The Hornets still won. 18. New York Knicks (15) In a 97-84 loss to the Hornets, Jeremy Lin scored 26 points against his old team, which served as a reminder of the golden age of Linsanity, back when the Guardian had an entire tag devoted to him. The Wizards are currently under .500 and out of the playoff picture. Maybe it’s time for a coaching change. Is there anybody that just became available? The Magic lost their sixth straight game on Monday, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. 2016 has been particularly unkind to them. 21. Portland Trail Blazers (20)22. Utah Jazz (19)23.

In the offseason they signed Alfonso Soriano to a contract at 8 years for 136 million, and replaced manager Dusty Baker with fiery veteran manager Lou Piniella. After a rough start, which included a brawl between Michael Barrett and Carlos Zambrano, the Cubs overcame the Milwaukee Brewers, who had led the division for most of the season, with winning streaks in June and July, coupled with a pair of dramatic, late-inning wins against the Reds, and ultimately clinched the NL Central with a record of 85–77.

One of them was very tall with fair hair, the other was short and fat with a beard. The two young men waited for a few moments, and then ran quickly and quietly towards Mrs. Riley. The tall one held her from behind while the other one tried to seize her handbag. Suddenly Mrs. Riley threw the tall one over her shoulder.

The two surprised young men were still sitting on the ground when Mrs. Riley crossed the street towards a door with a lighted sign above it. Mrs. Riley paused, turned round, smiled at them and walked into the South West London Judo   Club. The two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because_. A) they had nothing to do B) they were homeless C) they were waiting for a victim D) they were guarding the shop Answer:","output":"C) they were waiting for a victim The two young men were standing in a dark shop doorway because they were waiting for a victim to target and attempt to rob. This is evident from their actions in the story, as they quickly and quietly approach Mrs. Riley with the intention of seizing her handbag. Their choice of a dark shop doorway as their hiding place suggests that they were trying to blend into the shadows and remain unnoticed until the opportune moment to strike. In the narrative, it initially seems that Mrs. Riley, an elderly woman, would be an easy target for the two men. However, they were in for a surprise when Mrs. Riley skillfully threw the tall one over her shoulder, causing him to crash into the other one and both ending up on the ground. Mrs. Riley's impressive actions imply that she had prior martial arts or self-defense training, which is confirmed when she walks into the South West London Judo Club after the incident. The situation described highlights the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and the potential dangers that may arise. It also serves as an example of not underestimating a person based on their age or appearance, as Mrs. Riley was able to effectively protect herself and her belongings from the two young men. The story concludes with an interesting twist, leaving the would-be robbers sitting on the ground in disbelief, having been bested by an elderly woman. This turn of events not only demonstrates Mrs. Riley's physical prowess but also her fearlessness and composure amid a threatening situation.

He is trained by Daniel Jacobs and shares a gym with former world champion Andre Rozier .","output":"No, these two sentences from Wikipedia do not have the same meaning. The primary difference between the sentences is the individuals involved in the training and their respective roles. We can break down each sentence to understand their meanings and differences better. In the first sentence: \\"He is trained by Andre Rozier and shares a gym with the former World Champion Daniel Jacobs.\\" This sentence suggests that the individual mentioned is trained by Andre Rozier, a trainer or coach, and this person happens to share a gym with Daniel Jacobs, a former world champion. In this scenario, Andre Rozier is the trainer, and Daniel Jacobs is a fellow gym-goer who has previously won a world championship. In the second sentence: \\"He is trained by Daniel Jacobs and shares a gym with former world champion Andre Rozier.\\" This sentence differs from the first in that it suggests the individual is trained by Daniel Jacobs, who, in this context, appears to be assuming the role of a coach or mentor. This person also shares a gym with Andre Rozier, who in this sentence is referred to as a former world champion. Here we see a reversal of roles, with Daniel Jacobs now acting as the trainer and Andre Rozier being a fellow gym-goer with a noteworthy achievement. To sum up, the sentences have different meanings due to the role swaps of Andre Rozier and Daniel Jacobs. In the first sentence, Andre Rozier is the trainer, while Daniel Jacobs is a former world champion that shares the gym. In the second sentence, Daniel Jacobs is now the trainer, and Andre Rozier becomes the former world champion sharing the gym."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Washington region’s fabled traffic jams eased last year With the nation’s economy on the rise, traffic congestion picked up last year in all but one of the 10 most congested metropolitan regions: Washington. In fact, Washington was one percentage point less congested, according to Inrix, the global traffic-tracking company that uses transponders in 100 million vehicles to provide real-time traffic flow data used in traffic reports. Every other city that made the traffic top 10 saw congestion shoot up last year, including Los Angeles (8.5 percent), New York (5 percent), Boston (22 percent), San Francisco (13 percent). Although Washington can no longer take perverse pride at being No. 1 or even in the top five (it slumped to seventh by one yardstick and 10th by another), commuters who want to fume can take heart that they still waste 40 hours a year stuck in traffic. Much has been written about a shift in the region’s urban dynamic, with people who once fled the city or who grew up in suburbia moving to the District. The population is up, but the number of households that own a car and the number of licensed drivers are not. More people are using public transit, rental cars and bicycles to get around town. But that’s not unique to Washington, nor is it the primary reason that the region saw a decline in congestion. “That’s what happens when D.C. shuts down for a month and government hiring slows with sequester,” said Jim Bak of Inrix. Furloughs and the government shutdown last year put fewer drivers into the daily commute, he said. “If we didn’t have the shutdown, D.C. would have been flat or up slightly,” Bak said. “Blame it on Congress. That’s kind of a popular thing to do these days, isn’t it?” Washington wasn’t alone in seeing a drop in congestion. So did Youngstown, Akron and Toledo in Ohio, Scranton and Allentown in Pennsylvania, and several other cities. “When you look at the cities with drops, they were the Rust Belt cities that never got [their economy] going last year,” Bak said. In all, 61 metropolitan areas in the United States saw traffic increase last year. Several of those cities — Austin, San Jose, Seattle and Boston — saw a corresponding growth in population as people were attracted by job availability and the desire to live in an urban core. “People are moving where the jobs are, and that’s major urban cities,” Bak said. “Young people who are coming out of college want to live in urban centers, not in the suburbs.” As that trend toward renewed urbanization continues, he said, the United States may struggle with more congestion. While the average driver in Washington loses 40 hours a year stuck in traffic, he said there are those who waste “way, way more than that.” With 70 percent of the world’s population forecast to be clustered around urban hubs by mid-century, he said commutes like the two to three hours drivers invest in San Paolo, Brazil, and congestion like the infamous 10-day traffic tie-up caused by road construction in Beijing in 2010 should be lessons for the United States. “The solution for us isn’t going to be building new roads,” Bak said. “Our future highways are going to be built with software and technology.” Get updates on your area delivered via e-mail. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Last year, traffic jams in the Washington region got a little better. While traffic got worse in many other big cities, Washington had one percent less traffic. One big reason for this is because the government closed for a month, and many people did not have to drive to work. People in Washington still spend 40 hours a year stuck in traffic, but it has improved compared to other cities. More people are also choosing to use public transportation, rental cars, and bicycles to move around the city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  Two university students studied different types of drugs for their exams. Kate studied statins, while Carol studied anti-depressants.  Which student learned less about rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? The answer is:","output":"Carol. The student who studied anti-depressants, Carol, learned less about the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis because her studies focused on anti-depressants, which are related to mood regulation and do not directly deal with cholesterol biosynthesis. On the other hand, Kate, who studied statins, learned about this enzyme because statins work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Therefore, the subject of cholesterol biosynthesis and the role of HMG-CoA reductase in it would have been a major part of Kate's studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The atrocities committed by the terror group ISIS are so horrific that a high-profile al Qaeda member, an American citizen, purportedly addressed the group directly in a new al Qaeda publication and lectured them that if they keep it up, Allah will not grant them paradise in the afterlife.      “My dear brothers: While no one can deny the considerable strength and prowess of the Islamic State group [ISIS] in military terms, at the same time, the crimes it has committed against Muslims cannot simply be overlooked or forgotten with time, because in Islam there is no statute of limitations,” the late Adam Gadahn said, according to an al Qaeda magazine published recently online. “And if these wrongs are not brought to an end and rectified here in this world, then a severe punishment has been promised both for those who committed them as well as those who encouraged, condoned or justified them, even if from behind a computer or mobile phone thousands of miles away.”      “Oppression of any kind is wrong, and [there] will be darkness for its perpetrator on the Day of Judgment. The Ummah’s [Muslim community’s] Jihad is not a video game; it is real life, with real consequences, in this world and the next,” he said.      Gadahn, born Adam Pearlman, was killed accidentally in an American counter-terrorism operation in January, according to the White House. Apparently the U.S. forces who conducted the mission didn’t know Gadahn was at the target location. Another al Qaeda member said in the magazine that it was an airstrike that killed Gadahn.      The interview with Gadahn, in which he discusses his background as a California boy in an unorthodox home and his bizarre journey into the ranks of al Qaeda, appears to have been conducted last fall. A majority of the 80-plus page interview is dedicated to sharp criticism of ISIS, the terror group that split from al Qaeda in recent years and one that Gadahn says “is already known to be responsible for the murder and killing of a large number of Muslims on the flimsiest of pretexts.”      “Does anyone think [Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda figures] were calling on them to bring the wrath of the entire world down on Iraq and Syria by attacking and displacing largely powerless and defenseless minorities and slaughtering their men and enslaving their women and children?... Of course not!” he said. “Frankly, all of us used to be sympathetic to varying degrees towards the Islamic State of Iraq [ISIS] -- despite its mistakes –- when it was seen as a weak and oppressed force valiantly fighting brutal tyrannies. But now that it has become clear that it has – unfortunately – adopted some of the traits, methods and tactics of those same tyrannies, it no longer holds the same place in our hearts that it did once upon a time.”      AFP/Getty Images      Early last week ISIS released its most gruesome video yet -– one showing the execution of a dozen fighters, some purportedly members of al Qaeda’s Syria faction. Different groups of the men are drowned, blown up by a rocket-propelled grenade or decapitated with explosives. Friday an ISIS affiliate claimed responsibility for the bombing of a mosque in Kuwait, which killed 27 Muslim worshippers.      In addition to the mass killing of Muslims, Gadahn also took issue with ISIS’s on-camera murder of Alan Henning, a British humanitarian. Henning was one of a string of Western hostages, including three Americans, to be executed by ISIS. Gadahn claimed that al Qaeda went as far as demanding ISIS release Henning because he was an aid worker.      “…[T]he brothers in An-Nusra [al Qaeda’s faction in Syria] sought the release of Henning soon after his kidnapping, but regrettably, their appeals – like the rest – fell on deaf ears,” Gadahn said. “Alan Henning didn’t go to Syria as a soldier or a spy. He went to Syria as a member of a Muslim aid convoy to distribute relief supplies to displaced and needy Syrians. But rather than thank him, some interlopers rewarded him first by kidnapping him and then by slaughtering him on camera.”      But Gadahn's sympathetic words are out of place compared to other parts of the interview, where the American celebrated the attacks on Canadian soldiers and the Canadian Parliament, and later described his jubilant reaction to the 9/11 attacks in which his organization killed 3,000 innocent Americans.      “It was a mix of surprise, amazement and exhilaration as well as some apprehension, at least in the beginning,” he said. Gadahn said he was in Kandahar, Afghanistan when it happened and that night “there was a celebratory atmosphere… People were congratulating each other on this incredible and historic victory with which Allah had favored us.”      And like ISIS, Gadahn also called for attacks in Western countries.      “We in al Qaeda have been consistent in calling for attacks on America and its Crusader allies,” he said. ||||| (CNN) He was known as the American mouthpiece of al Qaeda, speaking against his native country on behalf of a terrorist organization that's devoted blood and resources to attacking it.      But not anymore.      The White House announced Thursday that Adam Gadahn , 36, was killed in January in a U.S. government counterterrorism operation. Neither he nor Ahmed Farouq -- another U.S. citizen and al Qaeda operative who died in what the White House said was \\"likely a separate\\" operation -- was specifically targeted, according to the statement.      While he wasn't one of al Qaeda's top leaders, Gadahn was one of its most prominent members, given his many statements on behalf of the organization.      Also known as Azzam the American, he was born in 1978. His parents changed their name from Pearlman to Gadahn after their marriage. He grew up on a farm in rural California and at age 18 moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were Jewish.      He converted to Islam in 1995 and left the United States for Pakistan three years later. His father said Gadahn last contacted the family in 2002.      No pizza dinner in Pakistan      A former al Qaeda member who later grew disillusioned with the group told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank that he was tasked with greeting Gadahn at Peshawar airport in September 1998.      Gadahn, who'd just just turned 20, had taken flights from the United States to London, then on to Karachi and Peshawar.      The former operative planned to take Gadahn to a pizzeria after he landed, before accompanying him by bus to al Qaeda's encampments in Afghanistan. But Gadahn told him he'd been longing for some Afghan food, so they went to an Afghan restaurant instead before setting out on the road.      The former operative said that after Gadahn joined al Qaeda, he was known as Abu Suhayb.      In the years after 9/11, Gadahn rose through the ranks in the tribal areas of Pakistan, becoming its chief official English-language propagandist.      He emerged in the mid-2000s on al Qaeda videos, including ones threatening attacks on Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia. At first he was disguised. Sometimes he spoke in English, but in other videos he spoke in Arabic.      He urged Muslims to target American, Western and Jewish interests with hopes of toppling the regime in Pakistan, according to SITE, a group that monitors terrorists and terror activity online.      A federal grand jury in California indicted Gadahn in 2006 for treason and material support to al Qaeda, charges related to his alleged involvement in terrorist activities that included \\"providing aid and comfort\\" and other services to al Qaeda, the FBI said. He was among the FBI's \\"Most Wanted Terrorists.\\"      In 2007, he appeared on another al Qaeda video in which he warned America to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly Muslim countries.      \\"Your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of September 11, Afghanistan and Iraq and Virginia Tech,\\" he said, the last reference being to the mass shooting at the Virginia university in 2007.      Tearing up his U.S. passport      In separate videos over the years, he criticized President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom he called \\"a devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name.\\"      He also addressed his Jewish ancestry and tore up his U.S. passport on camera.      Gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks, some which included al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.      He urged Muslims in the United States to stage their own lone-wolf attacks.      \\"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\\" he said. \\"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card.

His final video was posted online in September 2014 by al Qaeda media wing al Sahab. He called for Muslims to work to overthrow governments in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.      Cruickshank said Gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al Qaeda. Among the documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after bin Laden's death was a 2011 letter from Gadahn making recommendations for al Qaeda's media strategy.      Gadahn was married to a Muslim woman from Afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child. |||||","output":"A high-profile Al Qaeda member, Adam Gadahn, recently lectured ISIS directly in a new Al Qaeda publication, warning them that if they continue their extreme actions, Allah will not grant them paradise in the afterlife. Gadahn stated that although the strength and capabilities of ISIS in military terms cannot be denied, their crimes committed against Muslims should also not go forgotten. He warns that if these wrongs are not put to an end and rectified in this world, the consequences will follow into the afterlife. Gadahn, born Adam Pearlman, was killed in an American counter-terrorism operation in January 2015. The 80-plus page interview is dedicated to sharp criticism of ISIS for their brutal tactics. Gadahn particularly criticised ISIS's on-camera murders, and even goes as far as expressing sympathy for those killed addressing Alan Henning, a British aid worker, as an example. However, Gadahn also described his own joyous reaction to the 9/11 attacks and called for more attacks in Western countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who is protected from his wrath by spirits? from the following article ?  A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio are told by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight. In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, but as they touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain with the city of Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day. In the city, Argante and Armida, in danger from a common enemy, become reconciled and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After a struggle for supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which is the source of her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.

Process:  - Place the water in a pot - Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover - Place a larger pot under the first - Heat water to evaporation - Water vapor will collect on the lid - Drip into the second pot as fresh water - Salt is left behind in the original pot.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The lid isnt the proper one happens, how will it affect More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot..  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of using a lid that isn't the proper size for the pot can have a direct effect on the process of obtaining fresh water through the method described.  Step-by-Step Process with Justifications: 1. Place the water in a pot: This is the initial step to start the process and add the water with the salt in a container that can be heated. 2. Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover: The purpose of this step is to create a surface for the water vapor to condense on. However, since the cover is slightly too large, there will not be a perfect seal between the pot and the cover. This may cause some water vapor to escape, reducing the overall efficiency of the process. 3. Place a larger pot under the first: This larger pot is meant to collect the fresh water as it drips from the original pot's cover.  4. Heat water to evaporation: By applying heat to the water, the water will turn into vapor and rise, leaving the salt behind in the original pot.  5. Water vapor will collect on the lid: As the water vapor rises, it will come into contact with the cooler cover and begin to condense back into liquid water. 6. Drip into the second pot as fresh water: The condensed water on the cover will eventually drip down into the larger pot, thus collecting fresh water. 7. Salt is left behind in the original pot: As the water evaporates, the salt will be left behind in the original pot as solid residue. With the perturbation of having an improperly sized lid, more salt may drip inside the fresh water pot because the water vapor may carry along salt particles with it through the gaps between the pot and the cover. This could lead to the fresh water being contaminated with salt, which compromises the overall goal of obtaining fresh water through this process. Therefore, the perturbation has a direct effect on the process and its desired outcome."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: \\"What did the Hurricanes do 9 years after moving to Raleigh?\\"  Context: \\"The National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes franchise moved to Raleigh in 1997 from Hartford, Connecticut (where it was known as the Hartford Whalers).

To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world. The tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse   on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \\"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.

However, some people think it is not a good idea. There are a number of disadvantages in studying abroad. The following paragraphs will explain why students have these views and the advantages of studying abroad will be discussed.   Students studying abroad may suffer from racial discrimination . As they left their home country, they will become part of a minority group in the new country. The majority group may have a sense of superiority and try to bully them. It is common that Americans or the British discriminate against people from other countries since many of them think that white people are better than others.   In addition, the students may lose their own cultures. Since they have moved to a new place, all the thing there - people, lifestyle and the living environment---would be different from those in their own country. As they will have close contact with the local people and culture, they will be influenced by the new culture even without realizing it. It is ironic that a Chinese person speaks better English than Chinese and forgets about Chinese culture after studying abroad for a few years.   On the other hand, studying abroad will widen the view of students. Although they may give up their own culture, they can really learn from others. As students of the modern world , they should not limit their scope to their home country, but get exposed to the world. Studying abroad can help them expand their horizon and learn many things in the host country, as they will meet and make friends with people from all over the world. So, studying abroad is good for them.   Furthermore, students will learn how to be mature and independent. Students, when in their home country, usually rely on their parents. Statistics show that Chinese students usually rely heavily on their parents; they will leave problems alone and ask their parents to solve them. If they are studying abroad, on many occasions they have to learn how to cope... Options: A will be respected by the locals. B will forget their ancestors. C may be treated unfair.

In this case, the post talks about someone slapping a bank employee publicly, which could be seen as encouraging violence. Therefore, it meets the criteria of being a hateful post. Part 2: Expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or a group based on protected characteristics Usage: A sample input is \\"ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাকে প্রকাশ্য চড়-থাপ্পড় দিলেন ইউএনও\\". The hate or violence in this case is towards an individual, the bank employee (\\"ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তা\\"), and not necessarily based on race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. In this case, it does not meet the criteria based on protected characteristics. Part 3: Classify the post into personal or non-personal Usage: Since the example (\\"ব্যাংক কর্মকর্তাকে প্রকাশ্য চড়-থাপ্পড় দিলেন ইউএনও\\") is talking about and representing violence towards a specific person, the bank employee, it can be classified as personal.

Given the question: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.  Kenya's Masai Mara wildebeest migration is one of the greatest spectacles in the natural world. Every year thousands of wildebeests cross the Mara river. John went to see the migration last year. He noticed that the wildebeests crossed the the river in a very large group. He noted that as case A. His guide told him that is not the case in other times of the year. The wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups in other times. John noted that as case B. The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions.  In which case wildebeests would have lower risk of attack from the lions, case A or case B? The answer is:","output":"Based on the dilution effect and the examples provided, we can determine the answer step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the dilution effect: The dilution effect suggests that animals living in larger groups have a lower individual risk of being attacked because each animal is just one of many targets in the group. Step 2: Apply the dilution effect to the question: In the given question, we have two cases: - Case A: Wildebeests crossing the river in a very large group during the migration - Case B: Wildebeests crossing the river in smaller groups at other times of the year Step 3: Consider the impact of group size: Lions attack the wildebeests in both cases. However, according to the dilution effect, in larger groups, the risk of attack for each individual wildebeest should be lower compared to the risk of attack for each individual in smaller groups. Step 4: Determine the case with the lower risk of attack: Based on the dilution effect, the individual risk of attack should be lower in Case A (large groups) when compared to Case B (smaller groups). Conclusion: The answer is Case A, as wildebeests crossing the river in a very large group would have a lower risk of attack from the lions compared to those crossing in smaller groups."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I assumed it was a flat tire . Which was going to be impossible to change considering I did n't have the right shoes . I pulled over , and as I glanced in the rear view mirror , I noticed something shining . Answer the following question: what is the reason my shoes preclude me from changing a tire ?","output":"The reason your shoes preclude you from changing a tire can be attributed to several factors that could make the process challenging, uncomfortable, or even hazardous. Footwear plays a vital role in maintaining safety and enabling proper body mechanics while tackling tasks that require physical effort, stability, and precision. Here are a few reasons why having the right shoes is essential while changing a tire: 1. Lack of protection: Inappropriate footwear, such as sandals, flip-flops, or high heels, do not provide adequate protection for your feet during a tire change. Changing a flat tire involves handling various tools and manipulating the heavy tire itself. Wearing appropriate shoes with reinforced toe caps or puncture-resistant soles can protect your feet from potential injuries caused by falling objects or sharp debris. 2. Insufficient grip and stability: Changing a tire requires you to exert significant force and maintain a stable stance while using a lug wrench and lifting the vehicle with a jack. The wrong shoes, especially those with smooth or slippery soles, might not offer the necessary grip on the ground. This could make it challenging to apply the required torque to loosen lug nuts without losing balance, posing a risk of injury and making the tire-changing process difficult. 3. Poor ergonomics: Shoes that do not provide the proper support for your feet and arches can lead to incorrect body posture and strain on your lower back and leg muscles. Since changing a tire involves bending, squatting, and lifting, wearing inappropriate footwear could result in discomfort or physical strain, ultimately making the task more challenging and time-consuming. 4. Decreased ability to apply force: Wearing shoes with flexible soles can make it difficult to apply adequate pressure while using tools like wrenches or a tire iron. Firm-soled shoes, like work boots, help distribute the force evenly across your foot, allowing you to effectively loosen and tighten lug nuts during a tire change. 5. Impaired mobility: Changing a tire demands a certain degree of mobility, such as moving around the vehicle, kneeling down, or shifting positions. Shoes that restrict your movement or compromise your agility may negatively affect your ability to perform the task effectively and efficiently. In conclusion, wrong shoe choices can hinder your ability to change a tire effectively and safely. Wearing appropriate footwear, such as sturdy work boots or closed-toe shoes with good grip and support, can significantly improve your overall tire-changing experience and prevent potential accidents or injuries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: To be honest, people don’t usually ask me this. Instead, they want to know things like “How do I keep my mother from falling?” or “What should I do? My grandfather’s been falling.” After all, falls are a scary thing. Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult’s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving. So, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it’s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall. If you want to learn more, you’re in the right place. In this post, I’ll cover: * How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent — or yourself — safer, * Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips, * The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls, * A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself. First, understand why older people fall There are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons. So how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk? Now, you can — and should — try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews. But if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall.

Maricela Barajas, 41, and Juliana Menefee, 50, both of Diamond Bar were arrested Tuesday at their homes. Also arrested in the case was Eva Perez, 51, who serving an 11-year state prison sentence after pleading guilty in San Bernardino County court last year to multiple felony counts of grand theft in connection with the same scheme.      Barajas, Menefee and Perez each face at least 20 counts of grand theft and securities fraud. If convicted on all counts, each faces up to 20 years in state prison, authorities said.      As members of the the Armstrong Elementary School PTA, the women were able to gain the trust of many of their victims during school events and at social functions, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Mike Parker.      The victims believed they were investing in the AltaDena Dairy company, a firm the women said would get high rates of return because they had exclusive rights to distribute those products at Disneyland, Disney Hotels and to small retailers, Parker said. |||||       MARICELA BARAJAS      JULIANA MENEFEE      EVA PEREZ      DIAMOND BAR - Three former members of a local PTA were arrested for allegedly running an investment scam that defrauded more than 40 people out of millions.      Investigators said the suspects earned the trust of their victims as members of the Neil A. Armstrong Elementary School PTA in Diamond Bar.      Two of the suspects, 41-year-old Maricela Barajas and 50-year-old Juliana Menefee, were arrested Tuesday at their Diamond Bar homes.      The third suspect, 51-year-old Eva Perez, is already serving an 11-year sentence in prison for a fraud case in San Bernardino County. She is facing additional charges from this case. Deputies said she has residences in Chino and Diamond Bar.      The arrests came after a six month investigation by the sheriff's Commercial Crimes Bureau.      The suspects allegedly claimed to have the exclusive rights to sell AltaDena Dairy products at Disneyland, Disney Hotels and to small retailers and promised investors returns of up to 100 percent.      About 14 million was collected during the scheme from 2008 to 2010. Of that an estimated 10 million was returned to investors to keep new money coming in while the suspects allegedly kept about 4 million, according to investigators.      Detectives think the suspects used the money on lavish vacations, expensive hotels, new cars, and at casinos in California and Nevada.      None of the money has been recovered.      The alleged scheme started to unravel when the investors pressed for      Advertisement      payment.      Detective said the suspects organized meetings and attempted to pacify investors by explaining the delays in payment were a result of an internal audit of the business. By then one of the victims reported the scheme to the sheriff's Walnut/Diamond Bar station. Sheriff's officials said many of the investors took out second mortgages on their homes, maxed out their credit cards and invested their life savings. All transactions were done in cash and the losses ranged from 5,000 to 208,000.      The victims came from all over the Southland: Chino, Diamond Bar, Gardena, Granada Hills, Lawndale, Los Angeles, North Hollywood, Norwalk, Pacoima, Pico Rivera, Pomona, Rancho Cucamonga, Redondo Beach, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Fe Springs, South Gate, Torrance, Whittier, Wilmington, and Salt Lake City, Utah.      Barajas and Menefee were being held at the sheriff's San Dimas station in lieu of 500,000 bail.

June stereotyped Greg as being aggressive instead of gentle because she thought males were usually the","output":"dominant, assertive gender. She had been raised in a traditional set-up where males were seen as strong and determined individuals who would stop at nothing to get what they wanted. Over time and due to her exposure to various types of men in her life, she had formed a generalized idea that all men were the same, which led to her selectively categorizing Greg as being aggressive. This unconscious, yet ingrained, gender bias was not without its roots in societal scripts and mainstream media. Reflecting deeper, June could see how a great deal of her perception about men was influenced by movie characters that portrayed men as aggressive, brutish creatures with an undeniable show of brute strength and palpability. Televised sports events, where aggression in men was almost given, further propagated this stereotype. However, this stereotype was flawed in many ways. It failed to recognize the spectrum of human emotions that men are capable of showing. It succumbed to a monolithic representation, which in turn was an inaccurate portrayal of the complexity and depth of masculine identity. In stereotyping Greg as aggressive, June disregarded the varied facets of his personality, the same way society often pigeonholes men into singular, often distorted, roles. This casual sexism in June's perception led to her overlooking Greg's multiple strengths, which weren't necessarily aligned with the traditional image of masculinity. He wasn't just bold and strong but was also caring, compassionate, and empathetic. Greg had a nurturing side to him that wasn't synonymous with societal-defined masculinity, but it formed an equally integral part of his identity. Greg's gentleness was articulated in several ways. When communicating with his peers, he possessed a calm demeanor and was persistently patient, listening to everyone's opinions before making his own point. He loved building consensus rather than dictating terms. Interestingly, his kindness extended beyond people and was apparent in his love for animals and nature. Moreover, Greg had an emotional depth that clashed with June's preconceived notions of masculinity. His sensitivity allowed him to connect with people on a profound level. He was capable of expressing love, sorrow, fear, and several other emotions that the societal stereotype of men often disregarded. It was vital for June to realize that by stereotyping Greg, she was limiting her understanding of him and, by extension, of men in general. Indeed, stereotypes lack space for individuality, enforcing generalized views and hindering the process of understanding humans as unique individuals. Making pointed conclusions based on gender might have been her subconscious way to navigate her social environment, but it ran the risk of oversimplification and misinterpretation. By reconsidering her perspectives and challenging her biases, June could allow herself to see the all-encompassing nature of humans and respect gender fluidity. It would enable her to recognize Greg as being more than just aggressive or gentle, but as an individual with thoughts, emotions, experiences, and a unique set of attributes that made him represent much more than what traditional gender roles require men to be. She would see the man in Greg, beyond being just a male."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found.

Melora Rivera says she managed to crawl out of a window Wednesday morning, in order to run and hide on her roof after Christian Hicks, 29, allegedly broke into her home.      “He managed to break one of these panels and reach in to unlock the door,” Rivera said. “Once I saw him in the house, I knew that we both couldn’t be there. I knew that I didn’t want to have a confrontation with him of any sort, you know, not knowing what his intention was.”      Rivera, who says she was in bed at the time of the intrusion, was wearing only a flannel shirt.      As she made her way to the roof, with Hicks reportedly pursuing her, Rivera was able to grab her phone and call 911.      She hid under an eave as she spoke with the dispatcher.      “The drop is, I would guess, more than 20 feet,” Rivera said. “So there was no safely jumping off the roof or coming down from the roof at that point.”      Officers soon surrounded the house.      “It was my biggest fear was that he was going to be forced by the cops to come hide in basically the same place I was hiding,” Rivera said.      Bystander Alexandria Thompson saw what was occurring and captured pictures of the event, posting them to her Twitter.      Police said that officers were able to get to Rivera less than two minutes after they had been dispatched.      The fire department, too, responded on scene, and helped Rivera down off the roof, as police worked to get Hicks to surrender.      Through the pictures posted to social media, residents were able to identify Hicks as a well-known homeless person.      It turns out one of Rivera’s neighbors had called police on Hicks at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday for wandering into a yard.      “I saw this guy this morning in handcuffs,” Thompson said. “I’ve seen him in my yard. I called the police.”      Officers had detained Hicks, but were required to let him go since the caller refused to identify him in person.      Meanwhile, Rivera says the overall problem of homelessness needs to be identified and addressed.      “I think it’s very obvious for most of us who live around here, when someone seems to be suffering from a mental illness, and to continue to let these people walk around without offering them assistance, to protect them and us. That, I think, is the heart of the problem.”      Hicks’ bail has been set at 50,000 and he has been charged with burglary. ||||| Melora Rivera grabbed her phone and ran onto roof.

That didn't keep Sam down, though. \\"All in all, I don't waste energy feeling bad for myself,\\" Sam said. \\"I surround myself with people that I want to be with. And I keep moving forward.\\" This boy from Boston was so amazing, famous people and athletes wanted to take him under their own. Last Saturday night could have been an amazing moment for Sam. One of his favorite teams, the New England Patriots, wanted to make him their honorary captain during a playoff game. Instead, it just was't meant to be. Sam passed away before he had a chance to stand next to his team, so they held a moment of silence before the game for him. Sam's unbelievable view on life, and his deep effect on others, is hard to forget. He was presented with so many challenges in life but he wasn't afraid to face them. Be more like Sam, this wonderful teen. Surround yourself with positive people, love them and move forward. According to the passage, Sam Berns was a boy   _  . A) of great intelligence B) of complete failure C) with an optimistic view on life D) with a passive view on life Answer:","output":"C) with an optimistic view on life Sam Berns was indeed a remarkable and inspiring young man. Despite facing numerous challenges due to his rare aging disease, progeria, Sam maintained an optimistic view on life. He chose not to feel bad for himself or waste energy on negativity, but instead surrounded himself with positive individuals and always moved forward. Progeria is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation that results in the production of an abnormal protein called progerin, which blocks normal cell function. This disorder affects approximately one in every 4 million to 8 million newborns, with only about 200 children suffering from it worldwide. Progeria causes rapid aging in affected children, leading to a loss of body fat and hair, and an inability to gain weight. Sam's unwavering optimism and determination allowed him to face the challenges brought on by progeria head-on, with both bravery and grace. His exemplary outlook on life caught the attention of many influential people, including famous celebrities and athletes. One such example was when the New England Patriots, one of his favorite teams, wanted to make him their honorary captain for a playoff game. Unfortunately, Sam passed away before he was able to join the team for the game, but they honored him with a moment of silence in his memory. In his TED talk, Sam emphasized the power of positivity and the importance of surrounding oneself with supportive and loving people. His indomitable spirit continues to inspire countless individuals worldwide, reminding them to face their challenges courageously, cherish their loved ones, and always move forward. By adopting Sam Berns' optimistic view on life, we, too, can learn to conquer our personal obstacles and lead a more positive and fulfilling life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Every kid wishes to be an adult. Do you remember playing houses as a child pretending to be a grownup like your parents? Did you imagine you were a doctor, a soldier or a teacher? At that time, anything seemed more exciting than young. But now as grownups, some adults find they cannot leave childhood behind. They become \\"kidults\\"(kid+adult). Being a kidult has become a lifestyle choice among young people across Asia. Some kidults collect toys they once played with. Hello Kitty, Garfield, and Snoopy have many adult fans around the world. It is not unusual to see a 20something woman with a big, Garfieldshaped cushion on her sofa or a Hello Kitty mobile phone accessory . Other kidults still enjoy children's stories and fairy tales. For example, even an edition of the Harry Potter novels with an adult cover came out in Britain. That way, no one else on the subway will know that an adult is actually reading a children's book! \\"Kidults can be like vitamins to society. Adults who value their childhood and hold on to pure, childlike emotion may be needed in such a rough and dry society,\\" said a professor in a Korean University. He added that kidult culture might fill the generation gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and cartoon shows to enjoy together. Tim Greenhalgh, a professor in London explained that some kidults just refuse to grow up. They cling to  childhood because life in a busy and stressful city frightens them. Kidults would like to forget their age and openly show their fear of society and adulthood. \\"So, they look for an escape from increasingly complex and stressful life that are hard to deal with,\\" Greenhalgh said.

Imagine that one day, someone very important to you suddenly vanishes without any reason. No one knows where they are or what happened to them.

Today, the UN human rights investigators are worried about what is happening in a place called Syria. They say that the Syrian government has been doing something very bad – they have been making people disappear. This is scary because if people suddenly go missing, their families and friends will be very scared and sad. The UN helpers think this is part of a plan to scare lots of people in Syria.

Era A was set in the present day. But era B was set in the year 2040. Mike was surprised to find how Arctic area would change in the coming years.  Would era B see less or more ice in the Arctic than era A? Answer:","output":"Era B, set in the year 2040, would see significantly less ice in the Arctic as compared to Era A, which is present day. There are several reasons for this, which can be analyzed through understanding the impact of climate change on the Arctic and how various factors contribute to the accelerated melting of the polar ice. 1. Global Warming: One of the primary reasons for the decrease in Arctic ice in the coming years is global warming. As the Earth continues to warm, the average temperature of the planet is increasing. This leads to the melting of polar ice at an accelerated rate. According to scientific predictions, if the current trend of global warming continues, the Arctic could experience ice-free summers very soon, possibly within the next couple of decades. 2. Albedo Effect: The albedo effect refers to the reflectivity of a surface. Ice and snow, being white, have a high albedo and can reflect as much as 80% of the sun's energy back into space. However, as the ice melts, more dark-colored water and land surfaces are exposed, consequently reducing the albedo effect. Dark surfaces absorb more of the sun's energy, causing temperatures to rise even further, which in turn results in more ice melt. 3. Ocean and Atmospheric Currents: The ocean and atmospheric currents play a critical role in distributing heat around the globe. However, with rising global temperatures, these currents are being altered, leading to further warming in the Arctic. For example, the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, extends its heating effect further into the Arctic, contributing to the melting of sea ice. 4. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The excess greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, emitted by human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere. This increased heat accelerates the warming of the planet and contributes to melting of the polar ice caps. 5. Permafrost Thawing: As the Arctic warms, the permafrost - which refers to the permanently frozen ground in polar regions - begins to thaw. As it thaws, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and carbon dioxide. These additional greenhouse gases further amplify the global warming effect, creating a feedback loop which exacerbates ice melting in the Arctic. In conclusion, Era B, set in the year 2040, will see a substantial decrease in Arctic ice levels as compared to Era A, which is present day. This loss of ice is primarily driven by global warming and the subsequent impacts it has on various environmental factors such as the albedo effect, changes in ocean and atmospheric currents, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and thawing of permafrost. Addressing climate change has become even more crucial, as the rapid melting of the polar ice is expected to have dire consequences for the Earth's environment, ecosystems, and overall climate stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I really really REALLY wanted to like this place! I came to Cherry out of convenience. I own a salon and many of my own clients go to cherry and have beautiful lashes. When my lash girl was unable to accommodate my hours I called cherry to set up my first appt. and I saw Ariana! I loved my lashes and I loved Cherry. I had a set of lashes on from my previous girl and Ariana said they were quality and could just do a full. I liked them so much I started referring my own clients and even called my mom in an appt. for a fill since she had the same lashes from the same girl I had been seeing and Ariana said she could fill them.  This is when it gets bad...  On the day of my moms appt about a half hour AFTER her appt was to begin she called me and asked if it was normal to be waiting so long. Turns out Ariana had gone home early. No one bothered to call or even tell my mom when she got there! Just let he sit and wait! Anyhow she rescheduled an appt with Ariana for they following day and cherry offered her a discount.   She shows up for her appt and a lash girl who she thought was Arian starts removing her previous lashes in a painful manor. While she was sucking back her snot (she must have been sick or partied to hard the night before) she applied a sparse set of lashes to my mothers lashes..after the appt my mother finds out this girl is not Ariana. I felt horrible I referred my mother to be treated this way:(  So the day arrives for my appt with Ariana. I sit down and a bit later a girl calls me back. It was NOT ARIANA! So I go to the desk and ask what's up. They tell me Ariana is no longer with them. Ok, well thanks for the heads up! Anyhow I follow the new girl back to get my fill. I think she spent half the hour prepping and combing. When she was done she explained she was adding a black coating to them. She showed me. They looked OK. I wasn't too impressed but was sick of complaining already and they were giving me a discount for not letting me know I was being sent to someone new. I After about a day I realized my fill was barely a fill and the coating must had coated my natural lashes and worn off to show I had hardly any lashes:( I called to see if I could schedule  another fill ASAP. I am pretty busy and couldn't find time to fit it in for about a week so I just scheduled my two week out for a fill plus thinking this was the only way to get nice full lashes. She promised me Taylor would be the best for me and I was looking forward to seeing her.   Today was my appt with Taylor. Just got a call she was going home early and they would like to reschedule me with someone  else. REALLY Cherry? I'm done. Bad business. I'll be going back to my girl.

Buying cheap clothes was normal for Eric but not Jason because  Select from: A). Eric was very rich.; B). Jason was very rich.;","output":"B). Jason was very rich. Buying cheap clothes was normal for Eric but not Jason because Jason was very rich. This statement brings to light the differences in their financial situations and how it impacted their choices when it came to purchasing clothes. While Eric was comfortable with and perhaps even preferred affordable clothing options, Jason's wealth led him to make different choices in terms of shopping for attire. Being very rich, Jason likely had more disposable income and thus the luxury to shop for higher quality, more expensive clothing options. Wealthier individuals often have more financial freedom, which can translate into making purchases that may not be deemed necessary or practical by those with less means. Additionally, being wealthy may come with social expectations that would encourage Jason to dress in a way that reflects his financial status. Clothing can be a visible indicator of one's social standing, and Jason might have felt obligated to dress in a manner that reflects his affluence. In contrast, Eric may not have had the same financial resources as Jason, leading him to prioritize affordability when shopping for clothes. Many people find it essential to budget carefully when it comes to clothing and other personal expenses, especially when one's income is limited. It's possible that Eric was completely content with his choice to buy cheaper clothes and didn't feel the need to impress others through his clothing choices, whether due to a lack of societal pressure or simply valuing different priorities. This difference in their financial situation might stem from various factors, such as career choices, inherited wealth, or opportunities they each had throughout their lives. It's important to acknowledge that wealth can be a complex, multi-faceted concept influenced by numerous factors, and understanding why someone might be very rich or not requires delving deeper into their personal experiences and circumstances. In conclusion, the sentence insinuates that the reason behind Eric's preference for cheap clothes and Jason's avoidance of them is rooted in their contrasting financial circumstances. As Jason was very rich, his attitude towards clothing might have been shaped by societal expectations, his desire to display his wealth, or the simple luxury of having more disposable income to spend on higher-priced clothing items. On the other hand, Eric, likely with more limited financial resources, might prioritize affordability, finding himself satisfied with cheaper clothes and perhaps valuing different priorities in life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Flogging harms offenders less than imprisonment Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"To evaluate the claim that flogging, or corporal punishment, harms offenders less than imprisonment, it is essential to analyze various aspects such as the impact on physical health, mental health, social repercussions, and rehabilitation potential. Here are some points to support this claim: 1. Duration: Flogging is typically a prompt and relatively short-lived punishment, while imprisonment can last for several years. While flogging may cause intense temporary pain, it does not involve prolonged suffering, allowing offenders to reintegrate into society more quickly. 2. Physical Health: In some cases, flogging may cause less harm to an individual's physical health than imprisonment. Flogging often results in injuries that can heal within a matter of weeks, whereas long-term imprisonment can lead to chronic health problems like obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease due to a lack of exercise and appropriate medical care. 3. Mental Health: A significant concern regarding imprisonment is the negative impact on an offender's mental health. Long-term incarceration can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. In comparison, flogging does not involve long periods of confinement, potentially reducing the risk of developing mental health issues. 4. Overcrowding in Prisons: Prison overcrowding is a significant issue, which often results in unsanitary living conditions and increased violence among inmates. By using alternative punishments like flogging, the strain on the prison system could be reduced, lessening the potential harm experienced by offenders. 5. Family Relationships: Those who are imprisoned for long periods are often separated from their families, leading to fractured relationships and negative consequences for spouses and children. On the other hand, flogging allows offenders to return to their families sooner, potentially preserving family bonds. 6. Employment opportunities: Imprisonment often results in the loss of employment opportunities as ex-prisoners face discrimination upon their release. In many cases, individuals struggle to find work and may be at risk of reoffending. Flogging, with its faster reintegration process, may allow offenders to retain their jobs or find new ones relatively easier. 7. Rehabilitation: Incarceration is often viewed as providing an opportunity for rehabilitation through education and job training programs. However, the effectiveness of these programs is debated, and many prisoners do not receive adequate rehabilitation services. Although flogging does not inherently offer rehabilitation, the shorter duration of punishment allows offenders to seek help and reintegrate into society sooner. 8. Stigma: While both flogging and imprisonment carry a social stigma, the long-lasting effects of imprisonment can lead to ostracism and marginalization that persist even after release. In contrast, flogging is a more immediate punishment with potentially less enduring social consequences. While these points suggest that flogging might harm offenders less than imprisonment in some aspects, it is crucial to recognize that the ethics and effectiveness of corporal punishment are widely debated. Human rights advocates often argue against flogging, as it could be seen as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Therefore, it is important to carefully balance and analyze these supporting points against criticism and concerns about flogging as a method of punishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A California school that stopped students from wearing American flag T-shirts on Cinco de Mayo didn't violate their constitutional rights, an appeals court ruled Thursday. The school's approach, according to the appeals court, kept students safe in a climate of racial tension. \\"The controversy and tension remained,\\" a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said in their opinion, \\"but the school's actions presciently avoided an altercation.\\" School officials were worried about violence and disruption of school activities \\"and their response was tailored to the circumstance,\\" the opinion said. The case dates back to May 5, 2010, when the principal of Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill, California, asked a group of students wearing American flag T-shirts to turn their shirts inside out or take them off. The students at the Northern California school refused, according to the appeals court's summary of the case, and later brought a civil rights suit against the school and two administrators, arguing that their rights to freedom of expression, equal protection and due process had been violated. Judges said the civil rights case forced them to weigh the difficult question of what takes precedence: students' free speech rights or school safety concerns? According to court documents, the incident occurred amid \\"ongoing racial tension and gang violence within the school, and after a near-violent altercation had erupted during the prior Cinco de Mayo over the display of an American flag.\\" The previous year, court documents said, a group of students carrying a Mexican flag had clashed with students who hung an American flag from a tree and chanted \\"USA\\" on Cinco de Mayo, a holiday marking a famous Mexican military battle that is often celebrated in the United States.

The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in. Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. Tarek has a car accident shortly before the experiment, after which he meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists. In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisonerâs name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and SchÃ¼tte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him. The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant.

A Detroit newspaper suggested that \\"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed.\\" Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as \\"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\\" Asked for a response, Presley said, \\"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ...

A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most? Options: A: A Frenchman just quarreled with the barber who did his hair badly in New York. B: An American just had a wonderful dinner in a well known restaurant in New York. C: A Japanese businessman asked for a pizza delivery from a Pizza Hut in New York. D: A Chinese student enjoyed his meal in a famous fast food restaurant in New York.

In this article, we will delve into how mobile technology is revolutionizing the dining experience for both customers and restaurants alike. Step 2: Discuss the convenience of restaurant discovery through mobile apps One of the most significant ways in which mobile technology has transformed the dining experience is by making it easier than ever to discover new restaurants. With apps like Yelp, Zomato, and Google Maps, users can conveniently search for restaurants based on their cuisine preferences, location, and budget. These apps not only provide detailed information and reviews of various eateries but also enable customers to make reservations and receive directions within the app itself. Step 3: Explore the benefits of mobile ordering technology Mobile ordering has been a game changer for the dining experience, allowing customers to conveniently place their orders and make payments within a few taps on their smartphones. This not only reduces waiting time for customers but also increases efficiency for restaurants. Furthermore, mobile ordering enables customers to customize their orders, ensuring that their preferences and dietary restrictions are accurately met. Many restaurants have now integrated their mobile apps and websites with popular food delivery platforms to reach a broader customer base and adapt to the growing demand for food delivery services. Step 4: Highlight the role of digital wallets and mobile payment platforms The rise of digital wallets and mobile payment platforms, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Venmo, have made it increasingly effortless for customers to pay for their dining experiences. The integration of these platforms within restaurant mobile apps and POS (point of sale) systems has made it possible for customers to complete their transactions securely and quickly, reducing the need for cash and physical cards. Step 5: Discuss the importance of loyalty programs and personalized offers Mobile technology has allowed restaurants to gather valuable insights about their customers' preferences and spending habits. By analyzing this data, restaurants can offer personalized promotions, discounts, and loyalty programs to incentivize customers to return. As a result, customers benefit from exclusive offers tailored to their tastes, and restaurants can foster strong customer relationships and improve their overall dining experience. Step 6: Touch upon future developments in mobile technology for dining As technology continues to advance, we can only expect further innovations in the way we dine out. Augmented reality experiences, the integration of voice assistants in ordering, and real-time artificial intelligence-driven recommendations are just a few possibilities on the horizon that could further reshape the dining landscape.

Начертание Божье, помещенное на каждом из Его детей, так же истинно, как и знак, помещенный на косяках дверей еврейских жилищ, чтобы сохранить их от [221 ] всеобщей гибели. Translate to English","output":"The divine imprint placed upon each of God's children is as true as the mark placed upon the doorposts of Jewish dwellings to protect them from [221] universal destruction. This statement emphasizes the significance and truth of the divine imprints or manifestations of God's love and design for each of His children, both individually and collectively. Just as the ancient Jews marked their doorposts with the blood of a lamb to signal their faithfulness to God and to secure their protection from the destructive plagues sent upon Egypt, each person carries within them a mark of God's love and purposive plan for their lives. The doorpost markings in the Old Testament were a powerful and prophetic symbol of faith, obedience, and provision. This not only demonstrated the faith of the people but also showcased the unwavering love and protection from God. Similarly, the divine imprints within every person reveal the uniqueness and purpose that God wants each individual to fulfill in their lives. In the contemporary world, these divine imprints can manifest in various ways. For instance, it may be seen through the talents and abilities that each person possesses, or through the purpose and calling in life that aligns with God's plan. Additionally, it may be observed in the range of physical and emotional attributes, which collectively reflect the diversity and creativity of God's design. The divine imprints, much like the ancient doorpost markings, are not only a source of protection and guidance, but they also serve as a reminder of the special relationship that God holds with each of His children. By recognizing these imprints and embracing them in their lives, individuals can find their true purpose and contribute meaningfully to the world around them in accordance with God's plan. These divine imprints are not limited to any specific race, religion, or social status, but rather can be perceived in every human being. This reinforces the idea of the universality of God's love and His intention to provide protection, purpose, and meaning to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. Thus, the statement underlines the significance and truthfulness of the divine imprint present in each of God's children, drawing a parallel to the mark placed on Jewish doorposts. It serves as a reminder that God's love and protection are continually at work within every individual, just as the doorpost markings symbolized God's protection in an ancient context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comments ranged from anguish and shock to an outpouring of support and concern for the injured Liu. The athlete, who won gold in Athens in 2004, crashed at the first hurdle but got up and hopped to the finish line. For many, it was a tragic repeat of the 2008 Beijing Games when he pulled out with an Achilles injury. \\"Ah Liu Xiang, my heart is broken,\\" said one user of the Twitter-like Sina Weibo website. News of Liu's fall dominated the front pages of many newspapers. Many lauded him as a hero despite his failure to progress to the final - unlike the general reaction to his withdrawal in Beijing four years ago, which spawned a slew of criticism. \\"Liu Xiang fell down, but he will be our hero for ever,\\" said one netizen, echoing the feelings of many who watched his dramatic exit. As Liu struggled down the track, he stopped at the last hurdle and kissed it, prompting the China Daily newspaper to dub that his ''last kiss''. He was then embraced by fellow competitors and helped off the track. ''He may not have cleared any of the hurdles, but he crossed the most difficult hurdle of his life,'' the official People's Daily newspaper wrote, paying tribute to Liu's persistence. Liu Xiang left the track in a wheelchair, after an Olympic build-up that had also been overshadowed by injury. He left London for Leverkusen after pulling out of the Diamond League London Grand Prix 110m hurdles final on 13 July - his 29th birthday - due to muscle pain. Reports said that Liu's right heel was protected with tape when he entered the stadium on Tuesday. After the race, Feng Shuyong, the head of China's track team told a press conference that Liu had ruptured his Achilles tendon. \\"What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit,\\" state media quoted him as saying. \\"Winning is not so important, participation is what matters.\\" Liu Yandong, a top Communist Party official, had called Liu to ''express sympathy and concern'', state media reported. The official told Liu that ''his spirit, will and attitude have deeply moved and highly inspired the whole nation\\", said the Xinhua news agency. Some netizens questioned why Liu, who is one of China's top sporting icons, was competing despite his injuries. \\"Liu Xiang was carrying too heavy a burden. Chinese sports officials know nothing about the Olympic spirit. For them, athletes are just machines and pawns,\\" one comment said. Among the outpouring of support, there were a handful of negative comments and allegations against the athlete, who is easily one of China's best-known faces, with a slew of product endorsements. Some lambasted him for failing to do his duty by his country. But by and large, the Chinese people's reactions reflected a level of maturity and compassion within society, said a commentary in the Chinese edition of the Global Times newspaper.

The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of spiders through genetic manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the school newspaper, one of these new spiders lands on his hand and bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the venom injected by the spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter. Meanwhile, General Slocum (Stanley Anderson) visits Oscorp to see the results of their new super soldier formula. When one of Norman's top scientists, Dr. Stromm (Ron Perkins) warns him the formula is unstable, General Slocum threatens to pull all of the military's funding from Oscorp. Later that night, Norman exposes himself to the formula. He gains superhuman strength and agility but is driven insane. He kills Stromm and steals two other Oscorp inventions, an exoskeleton and jet glider.Peter wakes up the next morning feeling better than ever.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  In 1942, Nazi Germany attempts to bring neutral Turkey into the war on its side by staging an assassination attempt on Franz von Papen, its own ambassador to the country. Much to the annoyance of Colonel Robinson, von Papen survives and the Russians that his agent provocateur was trying to frame have solid alibis, forcing him to turn to another scheme to inflame Turkey's traditional rivalry with Russia.  Meanwhile, American machinery salesman Joe Barton boards the Baghdad-Istanbul Express train at Aleppo and is attracted to another passenger, Ana Remzi. She is worried about being searched by customs agents once they reach the Turkish border; she asks Joe to hold on to an envelope containing some securities, all that remains of her inheritance. Joe obliges, but when he later examines the envelope, he finds maps of Turkey with writing on them. When they stop in Ankara, he goes to her hotel to return her property, only to find she has been fatally wounded. He hides when someone else approaches the room. He watches unobserved as Soviet spy Nikolai Zaleshoff searches the dead woman's luggage. Then, Joe exits through the window. Leaving the scene, he is seen by Tamara Zaleshoff, Nikolai's sister and partner in espionage. The Turkish police take Joe in for questioning, only it turns out that they are German agents. They take him to their leader, Colonel Robinson. Robinson wants the maps. Joe refuses to cooperate, and is taken away to be interrogated by Mailler. Before the Germans get very far, Joe is rescued by Nikolai. When the Zaleshoffs reveal that they are Soviet agents, Joe agrees to fetch them the documents. Unfortunately, he finds his hotel room has been ransacked and the documents stolen. Joe, it turns out, is also a spy (for the United States).

Bank customers of NatWest bank in Ipswich, England ducked for cover on Friday as a protective seagull swooped towards people as they approached the bank entrance, local news outlet the Ipswich Star reports. According to the report, a baby seagull fell from its nest overnight and was resting near the door of the bank before eventually making its way to a safer location. Fortunately, a spokesperson for the bank reported that the baby chick did survive the fall and was not removed from its natural habitat. To protect customers, a bak employee escorted people to and from the entrance using one of the best bird defensive mechanisms available: an umbrella. A spokesperson for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) told the Ipswich Star that in some cases it's better to leave the animal with its natural parents instead of taking it into captivity. Although two customers reported being hit by the bird, there were no serious injuries. Summary:","output":"A protective seagull at a NatWest bank in Ipswich, England, forced employees to escort customers under an umbrella to safeguard them from the bird's attacks. The seagull was defending its baby, which had fallen from its nest near the bank entrance. Despite a few customers being hit, no serious injuries were reported. The baby seagull survived the fall, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals advised against removing it from its natural habitat."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Maybe you don't have to put on a suit or sit opposite someone behind a big desk like at the bank, but taking out a loan from a friend should not be treated as a trivial matter. Lending and borrowing money is a big deal and should be treated as such.","output":"Start out by taking thorough stock of your own financial situation.  Evaluate why you are in need of borrowing money - Is it a one-off emergency or a sign of a more structural financial problem? This reflection is crucial to take into consideration, as it will assist in determining whether you're simply postponing a bigger issue that needs immediate attention.  Do some real soul-searching and evaluate if you genuinely need the loan. Assess what you need the money for - is it an absolute necessity or a want? Necessities comprise urgent situations like medical bills, crucial home repairs or putting food on the table. Wants, on the other hand, are things like vacations, luxury items or entertainment. Keep in mind that borrowing money for wants might strain a friendship and potentially lead to uncomfortable scenarios.  After you've conducted a proper self-examination of your financial situation, you must come up with a realistic plan to repay. Building a concrete payment schedule consists of calculating how much you can afford to pay back each month. Factor in your income, expenses, and potential changes in circumstances. Remember, your friend's kindness shouldn't become a burden; you need to ensure that you’re in a position to repay the loan in a reasonable time frame. Communication is paramount throughout the entire process. If you decide to approach your friend, plot out the conversation in advance. Explain your circumstance honestly and why you have come to them. Yet, make sure to give them ample space to consider their decision without any influence - it's important to remember not to force or guilt them into it.  Just as with any financial decision, the language you use to communicate your need for the loan should be precise and clear-cut. It's advisable to steer clear of vague languages, rather opt for clear statements about the amount needed, the reason for borrowing, and your solid plan to repay the loan. Keep everything from terms, conditions, interest (if any), and repayment schedule in writing. Documenting the loan agreement is a step that protects both parties involved. With everything in black and white, there are fewer chances of misunderstandings that could lead to hurt feelings or ruin relationships. Ultimately, borrow responsibly. Always remember that, while borrowing from a friend may not come with the financial fees that a bank might charge, it does have the potential cost of a relationship. Hence, demonstrating respect and professionalism throughout the entire process is a must. Make it your absolute priority to avoid any scenarios that could evoke stress, misunderstandings, or damage to your friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is Estonia is situated in the northern part of the temperate climate zone and in the transition zone between maritime and continental climate. a good answer to this question? Pick from: a). yes b). no","output":"b). no While the given answer is partially correct, it can be elaborated and improved for better clarity and understanding. Here is a more detailed and long answer to the question: Estonia, a country located in Northern Europe, primarily resides within the northern part of the temperate climate zone. Geographically, it is situated between latitudes 57° and 60° North and longitudes 21° and 29° East, which places it in the overlap area between the maritime and continental climates. This unique location results in distinct variations in the region's climate characteristics. The temperate climate zone, which Estonia lies in, is generally characterized by moderate temperatures—neither exceedingly hot nor excessively cold—making it a comfortable region for human habitation. Though Estonia's climate primarily falls within this zone, its specific positioning also exposes it to influences from both the Atlantic Ocean and the colder Eurasian landmass, accounting for the climate's transitional nature between maritime and continental conditions. The country's maritime climate influence, primarily from the Baltic Sea, leads to relatively mild, wet winters with stable temperatures. Oceanic influences also result in moderate summers, with occasional rainfall and generally pleasant conditions. However, Estonia's position on the eastern boundary of this maritime climate zone exposes it to the effects of the colder continental climate, which can cause rapid and sudden weather fluctuations. This climatic duality is particularly evident during the transition between seasons, where the weather tends to be more unpredictable. In conclusion, Estonia resides in the northern part of the temperate climate zone while experiencing a unique transitional climate due to its location between maritime and continental climate zones. This results in a range of weather patterns and conditions that embody influences from both maritime and continental sources, contributing to the diverse and interesting climate of the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about List of Presidents of the United States. Yes or no? Answer: Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected President more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once. Question: how many presidents of the us A:","output":"Your question seems to be incomplete, but based on what you provided, I assume that you want to know either 'how many presidents of the United States there have been' or 'how many times a person can be elected as President of the United States'.  If you're asking about the total number of US presidents, as of 2021 there have been 46 presidencies, which have been served by 45 different individuals. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and therefore is counted twice, as the 22nd and the 24th president. If you're asking about how many times a person can be elected as President of the United States, as per the Twenty-second amendment to the United States Constitution, a person can be elected to the office of the President only twice. In addition, a person who has already served more than two years of a term to which someone else was originally elected, can only be elected to the presidency once. This amendment was ratified in 1951 to ensure that no single individual could hold the presidency indefinitely, offering a response to Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office. It's also worth noting that, while the amendment places restrictions on being elected to the presidency more than twice, it does not restrict a person from serving as President for more than two terms. For instance, if a Vice President or another official assumes the presidency for less than two years of someone else's term (due to the original president's death, resignation, or removal from office), they can still be elected president twice in their own right.

This is because the question suggests a connection between moving up and down and the flow of current. In an electrical circuit, the flow of current is controlled by switches, which, as mentioned, can be moved up for \\"on\\" and down for \\"off\\". This is a crucial aspect of electronic devices, allowing users to control the power and functioning of the device. An electrical circuit is composed of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes, which are connected together to perform specific functions such as amplification, filtering, or voltage regulation. Circuits can be designed in various configurations or topologies, such as series, parallel, or a combination of both. The primary goal of the circuit is to control the flow of electric current through the components in a desired and predictable way. In contrast, the other answer choices do not directly relate to the flow of current being moved up and down. For example: 1. An electrical storm refers to a natural phenomenon that involves the development of lightning and thunder, which is not controlled by human intervention such as moving a switch up or down. 2. Veins and arteries are part of the circulatory system and are responsible for carrying blood throughout the body, not electrical currents. 3. The mouth of rivers refers to the point where a river meets an ocean, sea, or lake. It is not related to the flow of electrical current. 4. A short circuit occurs when an unintended low-resistance path in a circuit is formed, causing a large amount of current to flow through the path. This can lead to dangerous situations, such as electrical fires. 5. Circulatory systems transport nutrients, gases, and waste throughout an organism's body. They do not relate to electrical current. 6. Bad wiring refers to poor electrical connections or malfunctioning components, which can lead to electrical hazards. However, it does not directly pertain to the concept of moving current up and down. 7. A hydraulic system uses fluid power to transmit energy and perform work. While it may involve the movement of fluid in various directions, it is not directly related to the flow of electrical current.

Sonny later sneaks into the cafe and accepts the offer of a free hamburger from the waitress, Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), when Sam walks in and discovers him. Once Sam sees Sonny's genuine affection for Billy he accepts his apology. Duane and Sonny go on a weekend road trip to Mexico, an event that happens off-screen. Before they drive off, Sam comes to encourage them about their trip and gives them some extra money. In the next scene they return hungover and tired and eventually learn that during their absence Sam has died of a stroke. He left the town's movie theater to the woman who ran the concession stand, the cafÃ© to Genevieve, 1000 to Joe Bob Blanton, and the pool hall to Sonny.

The four animals below are now in danger. Tibetan Antelopes Tibetan antelopes   are medium-sized animals. They mainly feed on grass. They are usually found in groups of about 20. They are killed for their wool, which is warm, soft and fine and can be made into expensive clothes. Although people can get the wool without killing the animals, people simply kill them before taking the wool. The number of them is dropping year by year. There are less than 75,000 Tibetan antelopes left in the world, down from a million 50 years ago. Golden Monkeys       Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong. They are bigger than any other animals on land. They are grey and have long trunks and tusks. They have poor eyesight, but very good hearing and smell. They can lift heavy things and break down branches with their trunks. Elephants are very friendly towards each other and towards their neighbours. Normally, they live in a group for many years. Young male elephants do not leave the group until they are about 12 years old. Now, there are very few elephants in the world. The number of them is becoming smaller and smaller because their living areas are used for farming. Also, people hunt them for their tusks. Wolves Wolves are not very big. They have grey fur.

What is the answer??","output":"We are given the equation: 1286906 = -6*o + 1286912 Our goal is to find the value of o. First, we'll isolate the variable, o, by moving all of its terms to one side of the equation. In this case, we will move the -6*o term to the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding 6*o to both sides of the equation: 1286906 + 6*o = -6*o + 1286912 + 6*o Since -6*o and +6*o cancel each other out on the right side of the equation, we're left with: 1286906 + 6*o = 1286912 Now, we need to move all of the constants to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 1286906 from both sides of the equation: 1286906 + 6*o - 1286906 = 1286912 - 1286906 Since 1286906 - 1286906 equals zero on the left side of the equation, we're left with: 6*o = 1286912 - 1286906 Now, we'll calculate the difference on the right side of the equation: 6*o = 6 To find the value of o, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 6: (6*o) / 6 = 6 / 6 Since 6/6 equals 1, we're left with: o = 1 So, the value of o in the given equation is 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.  I am facing a new situation today: Greg is a physician working for the city hospital. Today he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. He noticed that patient A's blood vessels are constricted, but blood vessels of patient B are dilated. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his observation.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would patient B's blood vessels be narrower or wider than patient A's? Answer:","output":"Based on the information from the background article, patient B's blood vessels would be wider than patient A's. This is because patient B's blood vessels are dilated, which means the walls of the blood vessels are relaxed, resulting in an increase in blood flow through the vessels. On the other hand, patient A's blood vessels are constricted, meaning the muscular walls of the blood vessels have contracted, which reduces the amount of blood that can flow through them. In summary, patient B's blood vessels are wider due to dilation, while patient A's blood vessels are narrower due to constriction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The defense and prosecution were hammering out a plea deal Tuesday in the court-martial of Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, but no matter what the negotiations hold, the defense says three things are off the table.  First, Sinclair won't plead guilty to sexual assault, said Josh Zeitz, a spokesman for the general's defense team. Nor will he plead guilty to any charge that will land him on a sex-offender registry. And lastly, Zeitz said, Sinclair will not plead guilty to threatening his accuser or her family.  No developments are expected Tuesday or Wednesday, and Zeitz said the negotiations could last for weeks.  Col. James Pohl, the judge in the case, dismissed the jury \\"for the time being\\" Tuesday morning to return to their duty stations, a spokeswoman for Fort Bragg in North Carolina said.  On Monday, a day when Sinclair's accuser was slated to continue her testimony from Friday, Pohl dismissed the jury because of 22 pages of e-mails that emerged over the weekend.  The e-mails include a January communication in which a senior military lawyer wrote Fort Bragg's chief of military justice casting doubt on the credibility of Sinclair's accuser and a February correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the Judge Advocate General's Corps asked for a colonel's \\"thoughts/opinion\\" on Sinclair's offer to enter a plea.  Pohl indicated there may have been \\"undue command influence\\" by Pentagon officials. While Pohl would not grant the defense's request to drop charges against Sinclair, he ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal, in addition to several other options.

Read this: The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous. Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute MI and is often described as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing. Chest pain due to ischemia (a lack of blood and hence oxygen supply) of the heart muscle is termed angina pectoris. Pain radiates most often to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen, where it may mimic heartburn.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  zombies  for the following movie plot:  The film opens as Rose (Brooke Adams) is found drifting alone in a small rowboat. Two fishermen find the dinghy and pull her onto their boat, barely alive and in a horrible state. Her voiceover indicates she had been rescued from some terrifying experience. The film's events are flashbacks.Rose is seen previously as part of a small group of tourists aboard a small commercial pleasure boat. The Captain (John Carradine) seems to be having trouble with the boat. His mate, Chuck (Fred Buch), seems to share a mutual attraction with Rose. Also on board are Dobbs (Don Stout), who is the boat's cook; Keith (Luke Halpin), another tourist; and a bickering married couple named Norman (Jack Davidson) and Beverly (D.J. Sidney).After some trouble with the engine, the Captain and Chuck are faced with the fact that their navigation system is going haywire after they encounter a strange orange haze. The others sense that something is wrong and that they may be lost at sea. Norman in particular becomes very whiny about it, insulting the Captain and being generally abrasive to everyone. In the darkness of night, a hulking ship suddenly appears and brushes up alongside their boat, damaging it. The Captain sends up a flare, which momentarily lights up the eerie sight of a huge, rotting vessel wrecked nearby.The next morning, everyone wakes up to find the Captain missing. Realizing the boat is slowly taking on water, everyone evacuates in the lifeboat and makes for a nearby island.

Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a (not-so-heavy) metal song called \\"Hard Rock Hallelujah\\" and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters. But, let's face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents. The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event. The absolute last thing Lordi's first (and hopefully last) horror film brings is change and ingenuity. \\"Dark Floors\\", based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles, is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichés. The immense budget (\\"Dark Floors\\" supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art, but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people, among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness, become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown. When the doors open again, the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already. Trying to reach the exit, the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles, like eyeless corpses, screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors. The only three points I'm handing out to \\"Dark Floors\\" are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film. For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation, the atmosphere is quite creepy, but as soon as you realize the explanation will a) be very stupid or b) never come, the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards. Lordi's costumes never really were scary to begin with (except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans) and, in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost-horror, they just look downright pathetic and misfit. With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations, I personally always presumed Finland  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales, but I guess that's another disillusion on my account.

Let's analyze the situation in detail. In the scenario described, there are two main objects: 1. A bag of flour 2. A sack of potatoes The position of these objects is that the sack of potatoes has been placed above the bag of flour. Consequently, this makes the access to the bag of flour restricted because the sack of potatoes is blocking it. As a result, in order to access or move the bag of flour, one must first move the sack of potatoes out of the way. Doing so clears the pathway and grants easier access to the bag of flour. This indicates that the sack of potatoes must be moved before the bag of flour can be moved. In conclusion, the statement \\"The bag of flour had to be moved first\\" is incorrect based on the given information, as the proper sequence of actions would be to move the sack of potatoes first and then proceed with moving the bag of flour.

Question:   A person takes a deep breath and wants to know if the air outside their lungs is stronger than the air outside. The air outside the body, compared to the air in their chest, when they have a large chest, will be higher or lower?    Text:  During inhalation, because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. Answer:","output":"Based on the given text, when a person takes a deep breath, the chest volume increases, which results in a decrease in air pressure inside the lungs as compared to the air pressure outside. The text states that during inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside because of the larger chest volume. To clarify further, the human body uses the principles of atmospheric pressure and pressure differences to inhale and exhale air. When we inhale, our diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, resulting in an increase in the volume of our chest cavity. According to Boyle's law, the relationship between pressure and volume is inversely proportional, meaning that when the volume increases, pressure decreases.  In this scenario, the person has taken a deep breath, and their chest volume has become larger. Consequently, the pressure inside their lungs has dropped. The air outside the body is now at a higher pressure as compared to the pressure inside the lungs. This pressure difference causes the air to flow from a region of high pressure (outside the body) to a region of low pressure (inside the lungs) until equilibrium is reached. Therefore, when the person in question takes a deep breath and has a large chest, the air pressure outside their body is higher than the air pressure inside their chest cavity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The agricultural lands near Zone A contribute to this issue, as rain dissolves fertilizers rich in nitrogen from the soil, and runoff carries them into the water body. The excess nitrogen promotes the overgrowth of algae, which consume carbon dioxide. When the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone. On the other hand, Zone B is not classified as a dead zone and is situated near a national park, where there is likely less human impact and agricultural runoff. As a result, Zone B would have higher oxygen levels in comparison to Zone A, supporting a healthier aquatic ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The crew spotted particles of ammonia drifting away from the laboratory on Thursday. Liquid ammonia is used to extract the heat that builds up in electronic systems, dumping that excess energy to space through an array of radiators. Nasa says the crew is in no danger. A spacewalk might be needed to inspect and fix the site of the leak. The seepage is coming from the station's port side, at the far end of the backbone, or truss, structure that holds one of the laboratory's huge sets of solar arrays. Commander Chris Hadfield reported seeing \\"a very steady stream of flakes\\". \\"They were coming out cleanly and repeatedly enough that it looked like it was a point source they were coming from,\\" he added.

Does the sentence \\"Treaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.\\" answer the question \\"What formed an important part of European colonization?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Treaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.\\" answers the question \\"What formed an important part of European colonization?\\" The sentence explicitly states that treaties were an important part of European colonization. It goes a step further by explaining that these treaties were used as a tool for legitimizing European sovereignty in various territories around the world. Europeans sought to establish their authority by signing treaties with indigenous peoples who were already residing in those lands. In order to delve deeper into why treaties played such a pivotal role in European colonization, let's examine the process and objectives. European colonization began in the late 15th century with the Age of Discovery, which was driven by technological advancements in navigation. The primary goal of this period was to explore and secure direct sea routes to Asia for products like spices and silk, bypassing the traditional land routes. As European nations ventured into the unknown world, they encountered numerous indigenous societies with whom they came into contact. As Europeans continued their exploration and expansion, the need to establish order and control over the newly discovered territories became evident. Colonizers sought to achieve this by forming treaties with indigenous peoples. These treaties served various purposes, such as ensuring the safety and security of European settlements, obtaining rights to resources and land, and asserting political control in the region. Many European countries, such as Britain, Spain, France, and the Netherlands, made extensive use of treaties to help achieve their colonial aims. For example, the British Crown signed numerous treaties with Native American tribes during the colonization of North America. These treaties often entailed territorial cessions by the indigenous peoples, establishing military alliances, and creating trading relationships. The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between Britain and Māori chiefs of New Zealand, is another notable example. However, it is essential to note that not all treaties were fair or just, and the indigenous peoples' perspectives were often overlooked or misrepresented in these agreements. In many cases, Europeans used a combination of coercion, deception, and outright force to impose their will on indigenous peoples. As a result, treaties, while central to the European colonization process, have left a complicated and, at times, painful legacy. In conclusion, the sentence answers the question by identifying treaties as a vital part of European colonization. It further clarifies that Europeans used these treaties to legitimize their sovereignty, create relationships with indigenous peoples, extract resources, and control territories. The use of treaties, however, was not always fair or just, resulting in a complex legacy that still impacts many societies today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Democrat slams Donald Trump Jr. for ‘serious case of amnesia’ after testimony Skier Lindsey Vonn: I don’t want to represent Trump at Olympics Poll: 4 in 10 Republicans think senior Trump advisers had improper dealings with Russia MORE is done being nice.      The president on Thursday night gave an ultimatum to House conservatives, telling them he’ll leave ObamaCare in place unless they get on board with White House-backed legislation to repeal and replace the seven-year-old healthcare law.      At a dramatic closed-door House Republican Conference meeting, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, delivered the message to rank-and-file Republicans: After weeks of talks, Trump is done negotiating the bill and wants a vote on Friday, according to a source in the room.      ADVERTISEMENT      The House had been set to vote Thursday on the American Health Care Act (AHCA), but the vote was delayed after Trump and leadership couldn’t corral the necessary 216 GOP votes.      If the vote fails Friday, Mulvaney warned, Trump will move on to other priorities like tax reform, and ObamaCare will stay as the law of the land.      Mulvaney attended the Thursday night meeting in the basement of the Capitol along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and top Trump aides Stephen Bannon and Kellyanne Conway.      But Mulvaney was the messenger. That’s because Mulvaney, the Tea Party favorite from South Carolina, was a co-founder of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that Trump and GOP leaders believe is standing in the way of passage.      The Trump officials didn’t stay long. Shortly after delivering the message, Mulvaney, Priebus and Bannon stormed out of the room. Asked what their message was, Bannon told The Hill: “Vote.”      Once the White House officials left, several House members lined up to speak at the microphones to rally support for passage. Freshman Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), an Army veteran who lost his legs in the Afghanistan War, called on his colleagues to come together to defeat ObamaCare.      “I’d like to think I know a little something about battle,” Mast said as the room erupted in a standing ovation, sources in the room said.      “This was almost like one of those classic scenes in football movies where they kick the coaches out and the players start talking with one another. It might as well been ‘Remember the Titans,’ ” said longtime Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).      “This is about the members. This is about the team players. This isn’t about the coaches,” he said. “This is about whether we can play together and win.”      Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a close Trump ally, confirmed the Trump administration's message after the meeting.      “There are no more negotiations,” Collins told reporters. \\"We have to have a vote tomorrow. He expects it to pass, but he's moving on if for some reason it didn't.\\"      The developments set up a likely vote on the rule on Friday morning and a vote on the measure later that afternoon.      Dozens of centrist and conservative Republicans have vowed to oppose the bill, putting them in direct conflict with their new president.      With all House Democrats expected to vote against the bill, the GOP can afford only 22 defections.      Freedom Caucus leaders, including Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), have been demanding additional changes to the health bill, specifically the repeal of ObamaCare’s 10 essential health benefits and the law's Title 1 regulations. Those regulations include the rule that bans insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions.      These changes, conservatives argue, will lower premium costs.      But Trump has only been willing to offer repeal of the essential health benefits, which includes maternity care, pediatric services, hospitalization and prescription drugs, among other things.      Leaving a Freedom Caucus meeting in Rep. Jim Jordan's (R-Ohio) office late Thursday night, Meadows declined to comment on his position.      An amendment will be released Thursday night that would repeal the essential health benefits and also add 15 billion to the AHCA's Patient and State Stability Fund. The 15 billion will go toward mental health and maternity coverage, which will be paid for by keeping ObamaCare's 0.9 percent Medicare tax on high earners for six years.      But the effect of the Trump ultimatum on the vote remains to be seen. Many of the critics of the bill said they’re still opposed, including Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), who heads the Tuesday Group of centrist Republicans.      Meadows said the roughly 40-member Freedom Caucus would hold an emergency meeting Thursday night to digest what transpired in the meeting, but added: “I'm still a no.”      Rep. Louie Gohmert Louis (Louie) Buller GohmertThis week: Congress seeks to avoid a shutdown Lawmakers call on Treasury to take tougher stance on Hamas in Qatar Colbert spoofs Louie Gohmert's Uranium One chart MORE (R-Texas) said the inclusion of repealing ObamaCare's minimum insurance coverage requirements — at the Freedom Caucus’s request — wasn't enough to win his vote.      But he also said lawmakers were so energized by Thursday night’s meeting that he doubts the bill will fail.      \\"I’m rather broken-hearted right now,\\" Gohmert told The Hill.      \\"There’s too many federal aspects to this that remain in place that appear to make it pretty well certain it’s going to be here for the rest of this country’s life. That means I can’t get there.\\"      Failure of the bill on the House floor would be a humiliation for GOP leaders, raising questions about their ability to govern effectively given that they control the White House and both chambers of Congress.      Trump himself has said for months that the safest course for the Republicans, politically, would be to do nothing and let ObamaCare collapse on itself.      And many Republicans on Capitol Hill feel the same way.      “Politically, the smart thing for us to do would be to just say, ‘OK, we won’t do anything, we’ll just let ObamaCare fail. If we think it’s imploding … then let it implode.’ And then we’ll step in and rescue,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a supporter of the bill.      “That would be the politically smart thing to do,” he added. “It’s not the right thing to do, though.”      After huddling with rank-and-file members, Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanMcConnell names Senate GOP tax conferees House Republican: 'I worry about both sides' of the aisle on DACA Overnight Health Care: 3.6M signed up for ObamaCare in first month | Ryan pledges 'entitlement reform' next year | Dems push for more money to fight opioids MORE (R-Wis.) went to the microphones in the Capitol basement, where he made a brief statement. He did not make any predictions about the fate of the bill.      “For seven-and-a-half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law, because it’s collapsing and it’s failing families,” Ryan said. “And tomorrow we’re proceeding.”      This story was updated at 11:23 p.m. ||||| Rep.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Abandoning negotiations, President Donald Trump demanded a make-or-break vote on health care legislation in the House, threatening to leave \\"Obamacare\\" in place and move on to other issues if Friday's vote fails.      The risky move, part gamble and part threat, was presented to GOP lawmakers behind closed doors Thursday night after a long and intense day that saw a planned vote on the health care bill scrapped as the legislation remained short of votes amid cascading negotiations among conservative lawmakers, moderates and others.      At the end of it the president had had enough and was ready to vote and move on, whatever the result, Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers.      \\"'Negotiations are over, we'd like to vote tomorrow and let's get this done for the American people.' That was it,\\" Rep. Duncan Hunter of California said as he left the meeting, summarizing Mulvaney's message to lawmakers.      \\"Let's vote,\\" White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said as he walked out.      \\"For seven and a half years we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it's collapsing and it's failing families, and tomorrow we're proceeding,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said, then walked off without answering as reporters demanded to know whether the bill had the votes to pass.      The outcome of Friday's vote was impossible to predict. Both conservative and moderate lawmakers had claimed the bill lacked votes after a long day of talks. But the White House appeared ready to gamble that the prospect of failing to repeal former President Barack Obama's health law, after seven years of promising to do exactly that, would force lawmakers into the \\"yes\\" column.      \\"It's done tomorrow. Or 'Obamacare' stays,\\" said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a top Trump ally in the House.      Collins was among those predicting success on Friday, but others didn't hide their anxiety about the outcome.      Asked whether Republicans would be unified on Friday's vote, freshman Rep Matt Gaetz of Florida said, \\"I sure hope so, or we'll have the opportunity to watch a unified Democratic caucus impeach Donald Trump in two years when we lose the majority.\\"      One announcement after Thursday's meeting moved things the wrong way for Trump. Freshman Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., stated he would oppose the bill, saying, \\"I cannot support anything less than a clean repeal of Obamacare.\\"      Thursday's maneuvers added up to high drama on Capitol Hill, but Friday promised even more suspense with the prospect of leadership putting a major bill on the floor uncertain about whether it would pass or fail.      The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the Obama statute had expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies.      The measure would also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, another stumbling block for GOP moderates.      In a concession to the conservative House Freedom Caucus, many of whose members have withheld support, the legislation would repeal requirements for insurers to cover \\"essential health benefits\\" such as maternity care and substance abuse treatment.      The drama unfolded seven years to the day after Obama signed his landmark law, an anniversary GOP leaders meant to celebrate with a vote to undo the divisive legislation. \\"Obamacare\\" gave birth to the tea party movement and helped Republicans win and keep control of Congress and then take the White House.      Instead, as GOP leaders were forced to delay the vote Thursday, C-SPAN filled up the time playing footage of Obama signing the Affordable Care Act.      In a danger sign for Republicans, a Quinnipiac University poll found that people disapprove of the GOP legislation by 56 percent to 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided. Trump's handling of health care was viewed unfavorably by 6 in 10.      House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who as speaker was Obama's crucial lieutenant in passing the Democratic bill in the first place, couldn't resist a dig at the GOP disarray.      \\"You may be a great negotiator,\\" she said of Trump. \\"Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready.\\"      Obama declared in a statement that \\"America is stronger\\" because of the current law and said Democrats must make sure \\"any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans.\\" Trump tweeted to supporters, \\"Go with our plan! Call your Rep & let them know.\\"      Unlike Obama and Pelosi when they passed Obamacare, the Republicans had failed to build an outside constituency or coalition to support their bill. Instead, medical professionals, doctors and hospitals — major employers in some districts — as well as the AARP and other influential consumer groups were nearly unanimously opposed. So were outside conservative groups who argued the bill didn't go far enough. The Chamber of Commerce was in favor.      Moderates were given pause by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In an updated analysis Thursday, the CBO said late changes to the bill meant to win over reluctant lawmakers would cut beneficial deficit reduction in half, while failing to cover more people.      And, House members were mindful that the bill, even if passed by the House, faces a tough climb in the Senate.      ___      Associated Press reporters Alan Fram, Kevin Freking, Ken Thomas and Matthew Daly contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"President Donald Trump has issued an ultimatum to House conservatives, warning that he will leave ObamaCare in place unless they support White House-backed legislation to repeal and replace the healthcare law.

(CNN) -- Oil company BP says it has resumed pumping oil to a ship on the surface after a weekend setback that halted efforts to siphon off the crude spewing from a damaged well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. Crews re-inserted the tube into the well's riser stack Sunday. The 4-inch pipe is now connected to a ship on the surface, 5,000 feet above the sea floor, and is pumping oil back to the surface, BP spokesman Mark Proegler told CNN. If successful, the technique will capture most of the oil that is pouring out of the well.

Your answer accurately identifies the source of the quote and provides relevant contextual information. Patrick Henry was a Founding Father and a prominent figure during the American Revolution. The speech took place on March 23, 1775, at St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia, which was serving as a temporary meeting place for the convention. The objective of this gathering was to discuss the deteriorating relationship between the American colonies and the British Crown. In his speech, Patrick Henry argued that the colonists were entitled to their liberties and that they should be prepared to fight for them. He passionately urged the Virginia House of Burgesses (the colonial assembly) to take up arms and join the emerging rebellion against British rule, insisting that a militia should be formed in every county of Virginia. Henry's speech was a call to action for the colonists who were facing oppressive British policies. The phrase \\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\\" encapsulates the energy, determination, and commitment he put forth in rallying support for the American cause. His impassioned words resonated with those in attendance and contributed to the growing sense of urgency in the pursuit of colonial resistance. Patrick Henry's words continue to be remembered as one of the most powerful and iconic phrases in American history.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which company's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant, PepsiCo or Kettle Foods?  Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Input: Question: All atoms have equal numbers of what two particles? Answer: electrons and protons Output:","output":"Task: The task is to provide an explanation and supporting facts about why all atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons, given the scientific question and its correct answer. Guidelines: 1. Understand the scientific question: \\"All atoms have equal numbers of what two particles?\\" 2. Recognize the correct answer: \\"electrons and protons.\\" 3. Provide a brief background on atoms and their structure. 4. Explain what electrons and protons are, where they are located within an atom, and their charges. 5. Explain the reason behind having equal numbers of electrons and protons in an atom. 6. Provide any additional supporting facts that help explain the relationship between electrons and protons in an atom. Using the guidelines, here's how to answer the question: Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter. They are composed of three types of subatomic particles: electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus of the atom, which is composed of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. Equal numbers of electrons and protons are found in atoms to ensure that the atom remains electrically neutral since the charges of electrons (-1) and protons (+1) are equal but opposite. The balance between the negative charge of electrons and the positive charge of protons keeps the atom stable, preventing it from attracting or repelling other atoms or charged particles. An imbalance in the number of electrons and protons within an atom would make it an ion, with either a positive (more protons, fewer electrons) or negative (fewer protons, more electrons) overall charge. These ions can engage in chemical reactions and form bonds between atoms due to the imbalance in charge. In summary, an atom has equal numbers of electrons and protons to maintain electrical neutrality and overall stability. This balance is crucial for the atom's interactions with other atoms and particles, and it plays an essential role in forming different chemical structures and compounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sandberg was recruited as chief operating officer of Facebook after meeting founder Mark Zuckerberg at a Christmas party, and is largely credited with turning the social media platform into the highly profitable company it is today. Sandberg was the first woman on Facebook’s board of directors and has been active as a board member of several non-profit organisations, and has built the Lean In Foundation, a charity and online community for women. However it was her book Lean In, published in 2013, which caught the imagination of women around the world. Sandberg argues that, “Women should be encouraged to ‘sit at the table’”, seek challenges, take risks and pursue their goals with gusto, urging women “to set boundaries and abandon the myth of ‘having it all’.” Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington is a Greek-born American businesswoman and media entrepreneur who co-founded news website The Huffington Post. Under her stewardship, The Huffington Post has become one of the most influential and important news and comment websites in the US, the first purely digital publisher to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize. She left The Huffington Post in August this year to begin a new start-up, Thrive Global, promoting health and wellness in the workplace. Huffington says that the world as it is creates stress and burnout for both sexes, but especially for women, who tend not to thrive in male-dominated working environments. “We need to redesign it,” she says. “And women have a great opportunity to do that.” Aged just 23, Karren Brady earned her nickname “The First Lady of British Football”, when she was made the first female managing director of a British football club, Birmingham City.

Now vice-chairman of West Ham, Brady stars in BBC’s The Apprentice alongside host Lord Sugar and was the small business Ambassador for the UK during David Cameron’s government, as well as being a strong advocate and champion for women in business. In 2014 Brady was awarded a life peerage as Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge, and was in addition made a Commander of the British Empire for services to entrepreneurship and women in business. Says Brady, “Those women who have got to the top need to ensure there is a pipeline of younger women, whether by networking or mentoring, who in turn are encouraging those below them.” During her long and illustrious career with Nickelodeon, Fox and Disney, Anne Sweeney was often known as the most powerful woman in entertainment.

In 1996 Sweeney moved to The Walt Disney Company as president of the Disney Channel and became president of ABC Networks, responsible for Disney’s entertainment and news television properties worldwide. Hugely successful and respected wherever she has been, Sweeney recently surprised many in the industry by quitting her executive career for a new role as a director. Sweeney is a supporter of Girls Inc., a charity which “inspires all girls to be strong, smart and bold”, empowering girls to be healthy, educated and to succeed. Sweeney said: “Define success on your own terms, achieve it by your own rules, and build a life you’re proud to live.” Whoopi Goldberg once said: “We’re all here for a reason. I believe a bit of the reason is to throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.” An inspiration both to African Americans and women throughout her long career as a comedian, actress, and activist, Goldberg was the second black woman to win an Oscar, and remains one of the few entertainers to have won an Emmy, a Grammy and an Academy Award. A long-time patron of many different charities, she is a Goodwill Ambassador for Unicef, a powerful advocate for LGBT rights and for Aids charities, as well as for many children’s causes. She has also been central in the US version of Comic Relief since it began in 1986.

Uroš III's decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at the Battle of Velbazhd against Bulgaria resulted in the alienation of many nobles, who sought to expand to the south. By January or February 1331, Dušan was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Dušan sources, evil advisors turned Uroš III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Dušan of his inheritance. Uroš III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Dušan had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uroš III ordered Dušan to meet him. Dušan feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Dušan marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uroš III fled, and Dušan captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petrić. On 21 August 1331, Uroš III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Dušan's advisors, he was imprisoned. Dušan was crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. The civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria feared for the danger of Serbia as the situation there had settled, and immediately sought peace with Dušan. As Dušan wanted to move against richer Byzantium, the two made peace and an alliance in December 1331, accepting Ivan Alexander as ruler. It was sealed with the marriage of Dušan and Helena, the sister of Ivan Alexander. Answer this question: Who was king later, Uroš III or Dušan?","output":"Dušan was the king later, after he forced his father Uroš III to surrender and imprisoned him in August 1331.

If Contract management includes the steps required to ensure that the agency receives products and services within established costs and time frames., can we conclude that \\"The agency receiving products and services should be aware of their costs and time frames.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"The agency receiving products and services should be aware of their costs and time frames\\" because contract management is a comprehensive process that ensures the efficient delivery of products and services in line with established costs and time frames. To better understand the connection and importance of this conclusion, let's dive into the different aspects of contract management and the responsibilities of the involved parties. Contract management is a vital component of any business relationship that involves the exchange of products or services between parties. It encompasses the entire lifecycle of a contract, from drafting and negotiation to execution, implementation, and renewal or termination. This process helps ensure that both parties fulfill their contractual obligations and adhere to the agreed-upon terms. Key components of effective contract management include: 1. Contract creation: The initial stage of contract management involves drafting the contract, outlining the terms and conditions, the agreed-upon costs and time frames for product/service delivery, and the responsibilities of each party. This process typically involves collaboration between the involved parties to ensure that the contract addresses their specific requirements and expectations. 2. Contract negotiation: Both parties review the draft contract and may propose modifications or alterations to the terms and conditions. Negotiations continue until all parties reach a mutually agreeable final version of the contract. 3. Contract execution: Once both parties have agreed upon the terms and conditions, they sign the contract to formalize the business relationship. This legally binding document now serves as the basis for the parties' obligations and their rights in the agreement. 4. Contract implementation and monitoring: With the contract in place, the involved parties must adhere to their respective obligations. The agency receiving products and services should actively monitor the fulfillment of those obligations, such as verifying the quality of delivered products or services, tracking project progress, and ensuring the agreed-upon costs and time frames are adhered to by the suppliers. 5. Contract administration: Throughout the contract's lifecycle, any issues or disputes that may arise need to be addressed. Both parties should have mechanisms in place to resolve these issues in a timely and efficient manner. Any changes or amendments to the contract should also be documented. 6. Contract renewal or termination: As contracts may have specific end dates or provisions for extensions, the involved parties should be aware of these timelines and make decisions on whether to renew the contract or terminate the relationship. By being aware of the costs and time frames of the products and services they receive, the agency can effectively manage their budget and resources, as well as hold suppliers accountable for delivering within the agreed-upon constraints. This level of awareness also allows the agency to address any potential issues or roadblocks promptly and make informed decisions regarding contract renewals or revisions. In summary, contract management is a critical process for ensuring the successful delivery of products and services, and it is vital for the agency receiving these products and services to be aware of their costs and time frames. This awareness allows the agency to actively engage in monitoring and managing the contract, ultimately helping to ensure a successful business relationship that benefits all parties involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists have spent the past two years getting to grips with its data. And on Tuesday, they reported that             Cryosat  was now delivering an unprecedented view of the seasonal growth and retreat of sea ice spanning the entire Arctic basin. The researchers also released a map showing the difference in height across the Greenland ice sheet. Click the two tabs above to see visualisations of the satellite's data. \\"The message is that Cryosat is working extremely well. Its data are very reliable and the measurements we have match reality,\\" said Prof Volker Liebig, the director of Earth Observation at the European Space Agency (Esa). \\"We now have a very powerful tool to monitor the changes taking place at the poles,\\" he told BBC News. The Esa director delivered an update on the mission at London's Royal Society. The information was also being released here at the             European Geosciences Union (EGU)  meeting in Vienna, Austria. Several satellites have already detailed the             recent and rapid erosion of summer sea ice extent  as the Arctic has warmed. But Cryosat's innovation has been to provide a means to get at a figure for ice volume - a far more significant number in terms of understanding the long-term viability of the ice. To do this, the satellite carries one of the highest resolution synthetic aperture radars ever put in orbit. The instrument sends down pulses of microwave energy which bounce off both the top of the ice and the water in the cracks, or leads, which separate the floes. By measuring the difference in height between these two surfaces, scientists can, using a relatively simple calculation, work out the overall volume of the marine cover. The Cryosat team, led from University College London, has spent the period since launch working through the satellite's measurements, validating and calibrating them against a number of independent observations. These include data from plane-borne instruments, from direct on-the-ice assessments, and even from scientific sea-floor moorings that profile the ice floes as they pass overhead. \\"We can now say with good confidence that Cryosat's maps of ice thickness are correct to within 10-20cm,\\" said Dr Seymour Laxon, from             UCL's Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) . Tuesday's release shows a complete seasonal cycle, from October 2010, when the Arctic Ocean was beginning to freeze up following the summer melt, right through to March 2011, when the sea ice was approaching peak thickness. Cryosat found the volume (area multiplied by thickness) of sea ice in the central Arctic in March 2011 to have been 14,500 cubic kilometres. This figure is very similar to that suggested by             PIOMAS (Panarctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System) , an influential computer model that has been used to estimate Arctic sea ice volume, and which has been the basis for several predictions about when summer sea ice in the north might disappear completely. In addition to the announcement on sea ice, the Cryosat team also published a digital elevation model (DEM) of Greenland. The big island, too, has experienced some rapid changes of late and is losing tens of billions of tonnes of its ice cover to the ocean annually. The DEM is a map of varying height, and the visualisation on this page incorporates a year's worth of data. For Cryosat, it is another illustration of its capability. Radar satellites have traditionally struggled to discern the detail in the steep slopes and ridges that mark the edges of ice sheets, but the Esa spacecraft can recover far more information thanks to a special interferometric observing mode that uses two antennas. \\"This is really the first demonstration of the interferometer in action,\\" said             Prof Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University . \\"The DEM contains about 7.5 million data points, and we're pretty confident this will be the best elevation model for Greenland, by some margin. Our next step is to compare it to previous data to see how Greenland has changed.\\" Cryosat's principal investigator, Prof Duncan Wingham - formerly of UCL but now chief executive of the UK's National Environment Research Council - summed up: \\"We have years of data to come, but I think it's quite clear that we will provide synoptic, accurate, Arctic-wide thickness; and that we will be able to determine the accuracy of the predictions of when the Arctic will be ice-free in Summer. \\"And I think it's also clear we can now sustain coverage of [ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland] right down to the coast.\\" The Cryosat update was timed to coincide with this week's             50th anniversary of UK activity in orbit . April 1962 was the month Britain became a space-faring nation with the launch of its first satellite, Ariel-1. As part of the celebration, current capabilities and missions with strong UK interest             are being highlighted .

Review: Amazon reviewers warned me that it would be difficult so I expected hard work and some expertise with computers to get PC Relocator Ultra to work. I wasn't surprised then that I had to install, run, tweak, undo, clean up, uninstall, and start over 4 times. I wasn't surprised that it took one to three days to get a response to each of my \\"online\\" tech support inquiries (I couldn't get through by phone except to hear the announcement to leave a message and a time they could call back). But I did expect some expertise from tech support and thought I would have an external hard disk by now with a functioning clone of my Optiplex harddrive. Boy was I optimistic! To add insult to injury, PC Relocator announces \\"Your relocation has been successful!\\" at the end of each run. I finally gave up and used MIcrosoft XP's Files & Programs Transfer Wizard and it worked fine! Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is negative. The reviewer faces multiple challenges while trying to use PC Relocator Ultra, such as having to install and uninstall the software multiple times and experiencing slow response times from tech support.

Joy: The sentence doesn't seem to express happiness or pleasure, ruling out joy. 2. Confusion: While the speaker is questioning someone's opinion, the language use suggests more than mere confusion. 3. Sadness: The sentence doesn't express a sense of sorrow or despair, ruling out sadness. 4. Neutral: The intensity of the language use suggests a very non-neutral emotion. 5.

It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\"  - A wilderness area is a region where the land is in a natural state; where impacts from human activities are minimalthat is, as a wilderness. It might also be called a \\"wild\\" or \\"natural\\" area. Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated Wilderness Areas, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.  - An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a national park, national forest, state park, or similar publicly owned, protected area. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property.  In the United States, the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States. When the park system was formed, many of these now-called \\"in-holdings\\" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed.  Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the United States Congress to acquire private residences especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other federal lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas.  - The Pepperbox Wilderness Area , an Adirondack Park unit of the New York Forest Preserve , lies entirely within the town of Webb in Herkimer County . Stillwater Reservoir and the Beaver River Primitive Area form the southern boundary , while the north bank of the West Branch of the Oswegatchie River generally forms the northern boundary . The western boundary is the county line , and the eastern boundary is the Raven Lake Road and the Five Ponds Wilderness Area . It contains 46 bodies of water on 270 acres ( 1.1 km2 ) and 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) of foot trails . The terrain is generally flat with a few small , rolling hills . Swampland predominates with spruce , fir and red maple . Alder swamps , marsh and beaver flows are also common . The drier sites are vegetated with pole - size northern hardwoods . The entire area appears to have been heavily burned over and logged in the past and is not particularly scenic by usual standards . It is , however , ideally suited for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing . Several ponds are found in the area . They are generally of low productivity and some may even be sterile . The area is classed as wilderness because of its remoteness and also due to the extensive wetland ecosystems involved . The flora and fauna associated with moist ecosystems , such as found in the Pepperbox , seem to exhibit more species diversity than any others in the Adirondacks . Birdlife and small mammals are especially abundant . There is very little human use of the area at present , except for light hunting .

It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - The Adirondack Park is a part of New York's Forest Preserve in Upstate New York, United States. The park's boundary corresponds to the Adirondack Mountains. Unlike most preserves, about 52 per cent of the land is privately owned inholdings heavily regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency. This area contains 102 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and an active timber harvesting industry. The year-round population is 132,000, with 200,000 seasonal residents. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the great experiments in conservation in the industrialized world.  - The Saint Lawrence River (Tuscarora: \\"Kahnawákye\\"; Mohawk: \\"Kaniatarowanenneh\\", meaning \\"big waterway\\") is a large river in the middle latitudes of North America. The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin. It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U.S. state of New York. This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Oswegatchie River is a river in northern New York that flows from the Adirondack Mountains north to the Saint Lawrence River. Much of it is within Adirondack State Park. The city of Ogdensburg developed at the mouth of the river at its confluence with the St. Lawrence.  - The Five Ponds Wilderness Area, an Adirondack Park unit of New York's Forest Preserve, is located in the towns of Fine and Clifton in St. Lawrence County, the town of Webb in Herkimer County and the town of Long Lake in Hamilton County. It includes 1,064 acres (4.3 km) of private inholdings, 99 bodies of water covering 1,964 acres (7.9 km), 57.9 miles (93.2 km) of trails, and 14 lean-tos.  - Upstate New York is the portion of the American state of New York lying north of New York City. The region includes most of the state of New York, excluding New York City and its environs, as well as Long Island, though the precise boundary is debated. Upstate New York includes the major cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, and Syracuse.  - The Adirondack Park Agency (APA) was created in 1971 by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller as a governmental agency that performs long-range planning for the future of the Adirondack Park. It oversees development plans of private land-owners as well as activities within the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Development by private owners must be reviewed to determine if their plan is compatible with the park. The agency is headquartered in Ray Brook, New York.  - The Adirondack Mountains form a massif in the northeast of Upstate New York in the United States. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of Adirondack Park. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about in diameter and about high. The current relief owes much to glaciation.   - A lean-to is a type of simple structure originally added to an existing building with the rafters \\"leaning\\" against another wall. Free standing lean-to structures are generally used as shelters.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Mitchell's son, Max, is an up-and-coming artist with a rebellious spirit, while Fuller's son, Ethan, is a dedicated college student studying environmental science. The brothers, facing their own emotional struggles and yearning for connection with their sons, decide to bring their families together for a summer vacation in a secluded beach house. Mitchell's wife, Angela, and Fuller's wife, Diane, are both supportive of this initiative, hoping that the summer can serve as an opportunity to heal emotional wounds and eventually bridge the growing gaps between the fathers and their sons. At the beginning of their vacation, both Mitchell and Fuller realize the extent of the emotional damage caused by their lack of presence in their sons' lives. They struggle to understand their children's interests, dreams, and fears. In their quest for redemption, Mitchell and Fuller each take an interest in their sons' respective passions. Mitchell begins attending Max's art classes and even starts painting himself to show support for his son.

Options:  (A). yes.  (B). no.","output":"(A). Yes. Dr. Karl Clark developed the hot water removal process in the 1920s, and it is indeed a good answer to the question. The hot water process was a crucial development in the extraction of bitumen from oil sands. Dr. Clark, a chemist, and engineer from the University of Alberta, dedicated considerable time and effort into developing an effective yet practical method for doing so. To further explain the process, it consists of the following steps: 1. Mining: The oil sands are extracted using large trucks and shovels or hydraulic excavators to remove the material from the Earth.   2. Conditioning: Once the oil sand is mined, it is then mixed with hot water to create a slurry, making it easier to handle and process. This step helps in heating and softening the bitumen, allowing it to detach from sand particles. 3. Separation: The slurry is fed into a separator where the low density bitumen floats to the top, while the water, sand, and clay – commonly referred to as tailings – settle to the bottom. The liquid bitumen is then skimmed from the surface, and some additional processing is carried out to remove remaining water and impurities. 4. Upgrading: After the bitumen is separated, it undergoes further processing, known as upgrading. In this step, the heavy, viscous bitumen is converted into various lighter crude oil products by using various processes, such as coking, hydrocracking, and hydrotreating. This makes the bitumen suitable for further refining into gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products. Dr. Karl Clark's hot water removal process revolutionized the way bitumen was extracted from oil sands, making the exploitation of resources in areas like the Canadian oil sands commercially viable. As a result, Clark's work paved the way for significant growth in the oil sands industry, providing a valuable boost to the economies of countries such as Canada that possess vast oil sands deposits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal.

Adeline Virginia Woolf (; nee Stephen; 25 January 1882 - 28 March 1941) was an English writer who is considered one of the most important modernist twentieth century authors and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Virginia Stephen was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London. She was the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Stephen, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, had three children from her first marriage, her father Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter, and four children were born in her parents' second marriage, of whom the most well known was the modernist painter, Vanessa Stephen (later Vanessa Bell). Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when Virginia was only 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially, her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother's death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where a number of their mother's family lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother's role in caring for Virginia's mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister.  George Duckworth also assumed some of their mother's role, taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa, then Virginia, in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage which resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virgina regarding the conventional expectations of young upper class women \\"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires - say to paint, or to write - could be taken seriously\\". Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \\"room of one's own\\" to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \\"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\\".  The death of Stella Duckworth, her pregnant surrogate mother, on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to Virginia's sense of self, and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her mother and Stella as \\"1897-1904 -- the seven unhappy years\\", referring to \\"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should, normally and naturally, have made those years, not perhaps happy but normal and natural\\". In April 1902 their father became ill, and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. Virginia's father's death precipitated a further breakdown. Later, Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a \\"broken chrysalis\\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolf's writing but the \\"broken chrysalis\\" was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. An Afghan villager who risked everything to save the life of a Navy SEAL is seeking asylum in the U.S. after his life came under threat in his home country. Mohammed Gulab could have left heavily injured Marcus Luttrell to die in the mountains, but instead took him to his village and protected him from the Taliban. In the extraordinary story depicted in the movie 'Lone Survivor', Luttrell was the only one of four Navy SEALs to survive a nightmarish firefight in northeastern Afghanistan in June 2005. Scroll down for video. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell (left) was the lone survivor of a firefight with the Taliban in northeastern Afghanistan in June 2005. Gravely wounded, he was protected by Mohammad Gulab until his rescue by U.S. forces. When Gulab found Luttrell he had been shot twice, suffered several cracked vertebrae and had shrapnel wounds to his leg. Speaking through a translator to CBS's '60 Minutes' in 2013, Gulab said: 'I knew I had to help him; to do the right thing, because he was in a lot of danger.' 'He very well could have just left me laying there on the side of that waterfall and let me die,' Luttrell said. 'But he didn't.' Marcus Luttrell, pictured third from right, was operating in Afghanistan supporting Operation Red Wings, when the rest of his team (pictured with him) were killed in a firefight with the Taliban in June 2005. Luttrell was rescued by American forces and came home to the US, back to his native Texas. Now Gulab needs help from the U.S. After his crucial role in Luttrell's survival, Gulab and his family had to go into hiding as they received death threats from the Taliban, their house was burned down, and his cousin was killed. These threats had worsened after the release of the movie 'Lone Survivor' depicting the events surrounding Gulab's heroism and Luttrell's dramatic survival. Once audiences in Afghanistan had seen the movie and understood the role Gulab had played, it became dangerous for him to stay in the same place for longer than a night. Mark Wahlberg (second from left) played Luttrell in the 2013 movie 'Lone Survivor'. Once it had been seen in Afghanistan, threats against Gulab's life intensified as his role in Luttrell's survival became more widely known. Last Saturday, with the help of the U.S., he managed to escape Afghanistan with family members to a neutral, undisclosed, third country. He is now working with New York immigration attorney Michael Wildes to gain refugee status to enter the U.S. – the first step towards being granted asylum, CBS reports. Wildes is working on the exceptionally complicated case on a pro bono basis. Mohammad Gulab (left) attended the 'Lone Survivor' New York premiere in December 2013. Immigration lawyer Michael Wildes (right) has said that if he had applied for asylum then he probably could have stayed in the U.S. Much of the complexity comes from the number of agencies involved, from the United Nations to the Department of Homeland Security – and ultimately it is the latter that will make the decision. Ironically, the process could have been made much simpler. Gulab has been to the U.S. before, occasionally visiting Luttrell on his ranch in Texas, and attending the movie's premiere in New York in December 2013. Wildes said Gulab probably could have stayed had he applied for asylum on one of those visits. Despite a language barrier between the two of them, Luttrell and Gulab have become friends and have even gone shooting together on the Texas ranch. Gulab (left) pictured on a December 2013 visit to Luttrell's (right) Texas ranch where the two have enjoyed going shooting together.

Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Mission Movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson). The Jesuit missions were safe because they were... My question: How does Rodrigo Mendoza make his living ? ? A:","output":"Rodrigo Mendoza, a character played by Robert De Niro in the film \\"The Mission,\\" makes his living as a mercenary and a slaver. His primary activity involves kidnapping natives from various communities, including the Guarani community situated in the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle, and selling them to nearby plantations. These plantations where Mendoza sells the natives are colonial establishments meant for producing goods like cotton, rice, tobacco, sugar, etc., where labor-intensive farming is done by enslaved people. Among the plantation owners who use these natives as slaves is the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza, a character played by Chuck Low. In essence, Mendoza's income is generated from the brutal business of human trafficking, which allows him to profit off the suffering and displacement of indigenous communities.  However, Mendoza's actions lead to significant personal change when he experiences a moral and religious crisis, following the murder of his younger half-brother Felipe in a fit of rage. He spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his sins, which Father Gabriel, a character played by Jeremy Irons, provides him with an opportunity to seek penance. His journey towards redemption involves physically and symbolically carrying the burden of his past sins (his armour and sword), indicating a transition from mercenary and slaver to a penitent man seeking forgiveness. Over time, Mendoza transforms from a purveyor of violence and slavery to someone trying to protect and save the Guarani community he once exploited, eventually becoming a Jesuit under Father Gabriel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

The problem is: 53*j - 177 = -143 + 735 + 768 1. First, we need to add the numbers on the right side of the equals sign: -143 + 735 + 768 - Think of it like adding up your candies from three different bags. -143 + 735 = 592 (You can think of it as having 735 candies and eating 143 of them)  Now, we have 592 + 768. 592 + 768 = 1360 So now, our equation looks like: 53*j - 177 = 1360 2. Now, we need to get rid of the -177 on the left side. To do that, we will add 177 to both sides: 53*j - 177 + 177 = 1360 + 177 -177 + 177 becomes 0, so now we have: 53*j = 1537 3. Now, we need to find the value of 'j'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 53: j = 1537 ÷ 53 4.

It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more. Can we draw the following conclusion? The modern with pegs of Mastermind was not invented until 70 years after the start of the 20th century","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the modern peg-version of Mastermind was not invented until 70 years after the start of the 20th century.  As mentioned, the modern game of Mastermind was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. Considering that the 20th century began in the year 1900, we can calculate the time elapsed from the start of the 20th century to the invention of the game as follows: 1970 – 1900 = 70 years Thus, it took 70 years from the beginning of the 20th century for the modern peg-based version of Mastermind to be developed. This implies that the within pegs version of Mastermind was not around for a significant portion of the 20th century, having only arrived on the scene with the invention by Mordecai Meirowitz.  It is important to note that the Mastermind game we know today with colored pegs is inspired by the earlier pencil and paper game Bulls and Cows, which possibly dates back a century or more. Despite sharing similarities, the two games are distinct from one another in their gameplay mechanics and materials used. While Bulls and Cows was a mathematical game played with numbers and relied on players manually writing their guesses and results, the modern Mastermind features colored pegs, with one player creating a code using these pegs and the other player attempting to break the code by deducing the correct sequence of colors. In conclusion, given that the modern Mastermind game was invented in 1970, it is accurate to state that this peg-based version was not developed until 70 years after the start of the 20th century. Although it has roots in an older game, the modern implementation with pegs fundamentally transformed the game, giving it a unique identity and ensuring its place in history as a fascinating and engaging code-breaking challenge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unclear or insufficiently descriptive 2. Has grammatical or spelling errors 3. It is phrased awkwardly or contains informal language 4. It is overly broad or lacks specificity Now, to improve the question in question, the following steps can be taken: 1. Clarity and Descriptiveness: Ensure that the question is clear and easily understandable. Provide enough context and details to guide the respondents in the direction of what information you are looking for. 2. Grammar and Spelling: Review the question for any grammatical or spelling errors and correct them. Users are more likely to engage with well-written questions. 3. Proper phrasing and language: Reframe the question using formal and appropriate language. If needed, restructure the question to make it more readable and easier to understand. 4. Specificity: Narrow down the scope of the question and make it more specific, so potential answerers will know precisely what you are asking. If there are several aspects to the question, consider breaking it into multiple separate questions. Providing an example of an improved version of the first question: “What steps can be taken on Quora to effectively edit and improve a question that has been marked as 'needs improvement'?” Question 2: Is there a way on Quora to ask why a specific question was marked as needs improvement? Asking why a specific question was marked as \\"needs improvement\\" can help the user get more insight into how to enhance and modify their question. Unfortunately, Quora does not provide a direct or built-in way to ask for the reasoning behind why a particular question received this designation. However, there are still a few options that you can consider to gain some insight: 1. Reach out to experienced users: You can directly message or ask experienced Quora users in a related topic to review your question and provide feedback. They might provide valuable advice or guidance on specific improvements. 2. Observe other questions: By looking at similar questions in the same topic, you can compare and make changes to your question based on the trends and successful questions you see. This process can help you identify what works best on Quora and optimize your question accordingly. 3. Use the \\"Edit\\" feature: Even if you're unsure why your question has been marked as needing improvement, you can still try to optimize it by following the guidelines for improving questions (as discussed in response to the first question). Once you've made your edits, you can resubmit the question to see if it receives a more positive response from the community. In conclusion, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is asking for recommendations on how to improve a question, while the second question is looking for ways to understand why a particular question was marked as \\"needs improvement\\" on Quora.

Title: Rashomon Movie plot: The film opens on a woodcutter (æ¨æ¨µã; Kikori, played by Takashi Shimura) and a priest (ææ³å¸«; Tabi HÅshi, Minoru Chiaki) sitting beneath the RajÅmon city gate to stay dry in a downpour. A commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) joins them and they tell him that they have witnessed a disturbing story, which they then begin recounting to him. The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit. The woman, filled with shame, then begged him to duel to the death with her husband, to save her from the guilt and shame of having two men know her dishonor. TajÅmaru honorably set the samurai free and dueled with him. In TajÅmaru's recollection they fought skillfully and fiercely, but in the end TajÅmaru was the victor and the woman ran away.

It moves to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Unlike all other standard chess pieces, the knight can \`\`jump over'' all other pieces (of either color) to its destination square. It captures an enemy piece by replacing it on its square. The knight's ability to \`\`jump over'' other pieces means it tends to be at its most powerful in closed positions , in contrast to a bishop. The knight moves alternately to light and dark squares. Is the following statement correct based on the text in chess can a knight jump over two pieces","output":"Yes, the statement is correct based on the text. The knight in chess can \\"jump over\\" all other pieces (of either color) to its destination square.

US President Herbert Hoover belonged to which political party?","output":"Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States, belonged to the Republican Party. Born on August 10, 1874, Hoover was a prominent and successful engineer and businessman before entering politics. As a member of the Republican Party, Hoover believed in supporting a limited government with minimal intervention in daily life and an emphasis on individual responsibility. His political stance was grounded in the principles of American conservatism, and he endeavored to prioritize free enterprise, economic growth, and efficient governance. Hoover's tenure as president lasted from March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933. His term began in an era marked by economic prosperity, but it was cut short by the onset of the Great Depression, which started in October 1929 following the stock market crash. The Great Depression would ultimately take a heavy toll on his presidency and redefine U.S. politics for decades to come. Initially, Hoover tried to combat the economic crisis using typical Republican strategies – he advocated for voluntary state and local responses while trying to maintain a balanced budget. However, as the Great Depression deepened, he was ultimately forced to intervene more directly and drastically to address the country's dire economic conditions. Some of his interventions included the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and a series of agricultural policies aimed at stabilizing food prices. Unfortunately for Hoover and the Republican Party, these efforts were not enough to turn the economy around, and the American public largely blamed Hoover for the severity and duration of the depression. In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover lost by a landslide to Democratic nominee, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who introduced the New Deal, a series of economic relief and social programs that promised sweeping reforms to alleviate the effects of the depression. Herbert Hoover's presidency, marked by the Great Depression and a failed attempt at recovery, contributed to the Democrats' dominance in American politics during the subsequent decades. Nevertheless, the Republican Party continued to evolve, ultimately reasserting its status as one of the two major political parties in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first crest featured three cannon viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich (nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannon. This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, The Gunners, inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down. What was the Arsenal crest from 1913 to 1921? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Alright, let me explain this simply for you. Arsenal is a football team, and they have a symbol called a crest. Before 1913, their crest had pictures of three big guns called cannons. But when they moved to a new place called Highbury in 1913, they didn't have a crest. This lasted until 1922 when they brought the cannons back in their crest.

Translate to English.","output":"If you reduce the percentage of use of the movable property for commercial purposes, you may need to repay a portion of the Input Tax Credit (ITC) already received. Here's the detailed explanation: In the context of Value-Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST) systems, businesses can claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) for the tax paid on goods or services used to provide their own commercial goods or services.  Movable property, also known as chattels, refers to tangible personal property that can be moved from one place to another. In a business context, this typically includes items like furniture, machinery, and equipment used for commercial purposes. In certain situations, the use of movable property may change over time. For instance, if a business originally used a machine 100% for commercial purposes but later decreases its usage to 80%, the percentage of use for commercial purposes has been reduced. As a result, the tax credit previously claimed may no longer be fully applicable. If you decrease the percentage of use of movable property for commercial purposes, you may need to adjust the Input Tax Credit you claimed accordingly. This could involve repaying a portion of the ITC already received to the tax authority. To do so, you would generally have to recalculate the tax credit according to the new percentage of commercial use and compare it to the original amount claimed. The difference would be the amount that potentially needs to be repaid. It is essential for businesses to monitor changes in their use of movable property and ensure that their tax credits claimed reflect actual commercial usage. Failure to account for these adjustments appropriately could result in penalties or interest charges by the tax authorities. It is always recommended to consult a tax professional or an accountant if you are unsure about how to adjust your Input Tax Credits due to changes in the commercial use of movable property."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Le programme en question visait à lutter contre plusieurs formes de violence, à savoir la violence physique, sexuelle et mentale, tant dans le cadre familial qu'au sein des établissements scolaires. Ainsi, les créateurs du programme ont mis en place des dispositifs pour venir en aide non seulement aux personnes qui subissent déjà ces types de violences, mais également à celles qui se trouvent dans des situations à risque, et qui pourraient devenir victimes à leur tour. Tout d'abord, pour aborder la question de la violence physique, le programme met l'accent sur la prévention et la sensibilisation. Il est ainsi question de promouvoir le dialogue et la communication non violente entre les membres de la famille et les élèves, afin de désamorcer les conflits avant qu'ils ne dégénèrent en agressions physiques. De plus, des formations sont proposées aux enseignants, aux travailleurs sociaux et aux professionnels de la santé, dans le but de leur fournir les outils nécessaires pour identifier et intervenir dans des situations de violence physique. En ce qui concerne la violence sexuelle, le programme vise à déconstruire les stéréotypes de genre et les préjugés qui peuvent favoriser ce type de violence. Ainsi, des ateliers sont organisés pour sensibiliser les jeunes et les adultes à l'égalité des sexes, au consentement, et au respect de l'intégrité physique et morale de chacun. De même, un accompagnement et un soutien psychologique sont proposés aux victimes de violences sexuelles, afin de les aider à surmonter les traumatismes subis et à entreprendre des démarches juridiques si nécessaire. Enfin, en ce qui concerne la violence mentale, le programme cherche à prévenir et à combattre les comportements toxiques, tels que le harcèlement, l'intimidation, le mépris ou la manipulation, qui peuvent avoir des conséquences dévastatrices sur la santé mentale des victimes. Pour cela, des formations sont dispensées aux éducateurs et aux professionnels de la santé, afin de leur permettre de détecter ces comportements nuisibles et d'apporter un soutien adapté aux personnes concernées. Par ailleurs, des campagnes de communication sont menées pour encourager les témoins et les victimes à dénoncer ce type de violence et à chercher de l'aide. En somme, le programme aborde de manière globale et complète les différentes facettes de la violence au sein du foyer et des établissements scolaires, en mettant un accent particulier sur la prévention, la sensibilisation et le soutien aux victimes.

Q:When can I get a cell phone?\\" The answer is when your parents think you need one, though many kids seem to be getting them around age 12 or 13. Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access  to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK.

Please answer a question about the following article about Hunting: Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom; in fact, \\"hunting\\" without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other countries is called \\"hunting\\" is called \\"shooting\\" (birds) or \\"stalking\\" (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers.

It implies that there will be multiple items presented to illustrate the point or concept being discussed. 2. \\"Work\\": In the context of this sentence, \\"work\\" likely refers to academic assignments, projects, or other tasks completed by students. It may encompass a variety of outputs, such as essays, art, presentations, research, or group projects. 3. \\"Produced\\": This keyword indicates that the students have generated or created something. It suggests that the focus is not merely on the students themselves, but on their output and what they have accomplished in their academic pursuits. 4. \\"Students\\": This term specifies that the subject of the sentence is the population of learners or individuals enrolled in an educational program. Given the context of the other keywords, this most likely refers to students within a Bachelor of Arts (BA) program, but it's not clear since the sentence is incomplete. 5. \\"Across the ba\\": As mentioned earlier, this portion of the sentence is most likely incomplete.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The... A:","output":"The system that pairs the eight songs off against each other in the context provided is called the Second Chance round or Andra chansen in Melodifestivalen, which is the Swedish music competition to choose their entry for Eurovision. This round is held to determine the final four entries that will move forward to the final round, as the 3rd and 4th placed songs from each of the four semifinals (totaling eight songs) compete in this event. The Second Chance round has gone through multiple format changes over the years. Initially, in 2002, a panel of former winners would decide the two finalists, but the format evolved and changed with time. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four, followed by another round determining the two finalists.  In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full-blown semifinal, taking place in a venue similar in size to those hosting the other semifinals and featuring a knock-out system for voting. This new format extended the event's timetable by adding an extra week. In the knock-out system, the eight songs are paired against each other, and the viewers vote to decide the winners of each pair. The four winning songs from these pairings then proceed to the final round of Melodifestivalen. Overall, the Second Chance round or Andra chansen plays a significant role in the Melodifestivalen competition, as it allows eight songs that didn't initially qualify for the final a chance to compete for one of the final spots. This system not only offers more exposure and opportunities for the competing artists and songs, but it also encourages greater audience engagement and interest in the competition."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Which farmer didn't provide a good environment for weeds?  Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops. Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method.  Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Answer:","output":"The farmer who didn't provide a good environment for weeds is Jake. This is because he uses the conventional tillage method for his farming practices, while Todd uses the no-tillage method. As mentioned in the provided information, no-till farming can provide a conducive environment for pathogens, insects, and weeds, potentially leading to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control.  On the other hand, the conventional tillage method used by Jake involves turning and breaking up the soil, which may be less hospitable to weeds compared to the no-tillage method. It is important to note, however, that the choice between no-till and conventional tillage depends on various factors, and agroecologists do not necessarily advocate for one method over the other. Instead, they consider the specific challenges and conditions each farm faces and may recommend intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till, or ridge-till, which are all forms of conservation tillage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Use a sharp knife to shave the beef into very thin slices. Cut the onion and shiitake mushrooms into moderately thin slices, as well.  To save yourself time and effort, ask the butcher to slice the beef very thinly before packaging it. If the butcher does not slice the beef, freeze it for 1 hour before slicing it yourself. Partially frozen meat is easier to cut than fully thawed meat. The slices of beef should be just a little thicker than cold cut lunchmeat is. This thinness is key. Beef that is too thick will not cook quickly enough. The slices of onion and mushroom should both be approximately 1/3 inch (1 cm) thick. Place the butter in a medium saucepan and set it on the stove. Heat over medium for a few minutes, just until the butter is completely melted. Add the sliced onions and sliced shiitake mushrooms to the melted butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for 4 to 5 minutes. The onion should become translucent and the shiitake mushrooms should feel notably tender. Add both alcohols to the saucepan. Cook for another 2 minutes. During this time, most of the actual alcohol should burn away, leaving only the flavor behind. Add the water, Dashi powder, soy sauce, sugar, grated ginger, and minced garlic to the contents of the saucepan. Stir to combine. Allow the contents of the pan to reach a steady simmer before continuing. Place the thin slices of raw beef in the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and cook gently for 3 to 5 minutes.  Use cooking chopsticks or tongs to carefully separate the beef slices as they cook. Doing so can help prevent the beef from sticking together. This may seem like an abnormally short cooking time, but if the beef has been sliced to an adequately thin size, it should be plenty. Do not overcook the beef since it can easily become dry. Fill two serving bowls with freshly steamed white rice. Divide the gyudon evenly and spread it over the rice in both bowls. For an even more authentic experience, prepare Asian-style sticky rice or sushi rice instead of relying on instant rice. Top each serving of gyudon with an organic raw egg. Crack the egg directly over the beef, allowing the yolk to remain intact in the center of the bowl when you serve the dish.  Please exercise caution when consuming raw eggs. Organic eggs from a clean, reliable source might be safe to eat, but the USDA discourages the consumption of raw eggs altogether due to the risk of salmonella. If you feel squeamish about consuming raw eggs, you may skip this step. If you do opt to include the raw egg, mix it into the beef and rice as you eat the gyudon. Doing so can give the taste of the dish a rich, creamy undertone. Gyudon is frequently topped with a bit of shichimi togarashi and beni shoga. Pair it with sides like miso soup and steamed vegetables. A combination of broccoli, cauliflower, and sliced carrots will pair especially well with this dish, but you can serve it with any vegetables you prefer. Consider steaming the vegetables for a few minutes, allowing them to become tender-crisp without turning into mush. Summary:","output":"To make gyudon, thinly slice beef, onions, and shiitake mushrooms. In a saucepan, melt butter and cook the onions and mushrooms until tender.

Biker gangs cleaned streets, volunteers planted trees and politicians spent 67 minutes on worthy projects - to mark Mr Mandela's 67 years of public service.      Children in schools around the country started the day by singing \\"Happy Birthday\\" to Mr Mandela.      Thursday also marks 15 years since the anti-apartheid leader married his third wife Graca Machel.      The UN declared the Nobel peace laureate's birthday Mandela Day in 2010, but for many this year takes on extra poignancy.      Winnie Madikizela-Mandela with a giant birthday cake      Mr Mandela has spent the last 41 days in a Pretoria hospital in a critical but stable condition after being admitted for a recurring lung infection on June 8.      His youngest daughter told Sky News her father has been able to communicate and watch television.      \\"He is making remarkable progress,\\" said Zindzi Mandela, adding that when she visited him on Tuesday he was \\"watching TV with his headphones\\".      \\"He responds very well ... with his eyes, and he nods and sometimes he lifts his hand like to shake your hand.\\"      Granddaughter Ndileka Mandela poured soup for poor children at a charity event and said her family had been unsure about whether her grandfather would live to see his birthday.      Mr Mandela's granddaughter Ndileka serves soup in a poor community      \\"But because of the fighter that he is, he was able to fight a repressive system, and he was able, through God and everybody's prayers, to make it today,\\" she said.      President Zuma opened low-cost housing for poor black and white families in the Pretoria area, while Retired archbishop Desmond Tutu helped to paint a school outside Cape Town.      US President Barack Obama also urged people to honour Mr Mandela on his birthday \\"through individual and collective acts of service\\".      \\"Through our own lives, by heeding his example, we can honour the man who showed his own people - and the world - the path to justice, equality and freedom,\\" Mr Obama said.      Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu helps paint a school      The South African government is hosting a ceremony for the symbolic handing over of Mr Mandela's new high-tech ID card, which will be received by Zindzi Mandela.      The event is laden with meaning in a country where apartheid was enforced by pass books, which black citizens were forced to carry and which limited movement to certain areas at certain times.      \\"On behalf of government and all the people of South Africa, we wish Madiba a joyous 95th birthday,\\" said Mr Zuma, using Mr Mandela's clan name.      A group of young South African artists and designers unveiled a project celebrating Mr Mandela's life through paintings and posters.      Mr Mandela's grandson Zondwa gives out food parcels to children      The group whittled down 700 posters submitted by designers from more than 70 countries, to 95 for each year of Mr Mandela's life.      A single special edition of the posters will be auctioned off to raise money for a proposed children's hospital that will be named after Mr Mandela, the group said.      \\"He carries across this concept of humanity and selflessness,\\" said Mohammed Jogie, a co-founder of the project.      Elsewhere world leaders, pop stars and companies also pledged their support for Mr Mandela.      \\"I will also be giving my 67 minutes to make the world a better place, one small step at a time,\\" said Sir Richard Branson.      The anti-apartheid leader's face has been captured in corn in Kent      In the UK, a giant portrait of Mr Mandela's face has been etched into the English countryside to celebrate his birthday.      The two-acre maze in corn crops in Birchington, near Margate, Kent, was the idea of Karen Botha and Dawn Tilley who have spent the past five years working on the design.      Meanwhile, 50 abandoned street children in the Philippines will get to tour a Manila television studio and see performances by local artists.

The country has been on edge since the former president and father of the multi-racial 'Rainbow Nation' established at the end of apartheid in 1994 was admitted to hospital on June 8 with recurring lung problems that kept him in a critical condition.      It was his fourth stay in hospital in six months and has reminded South Africans that the man who is globally admired as a moral beacon against injustice and a symbol of racial reconciliation will not be with them forever.      But the mood was of celebration on Thursday as thousands of South Africans sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" and took part in charitable initiatives in a global outpouring of support for the Nobel Peace Prize laureate on U.N.-designated 'Nelson Mandela Day'.      At a United Nations event in New York marking the day, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed Mandela as \\"a giant of our times\\".      Throughout the day, crowds of well-wishers outside the Pretoria hospital where the retired statesman is being treated sang \\"Happy Birthday, Madiba\\" - using Mandela's traditional clan name - brought cakes and birthday cards and danced.      \\"Thank you for all that you have done for this country,\\" said one well-wisher, Margaret Chechie.      Many South Africans also commemorated the birthday with 67 minutes of public service to honor the 67 years Mandela served humanity by first fighting against white-minority rule and then consolidating racial harmony when he was president.      As part of the public service initiative, office workers, students, soldiers and ordinary citizens spruced up orphanages, painted walls at schools and delivered food to the poor.      President Jacob Zuma visited Mandela at the hospital and said he was making steady progress. \\"I was able to say 'Happy Birthday' to him and he was able to smile,\\" he told reporters.      Hours earlier, his office had cited Mandela's doctors saying \\"his health is steadily improving.\\"      Mandela's victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system. Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony.      His former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela called the 95th birthday \\"a gift to the nation\\".      Family members had lunch together at the hospital where the revered patriarch is being treated and his daughter Zindzi said they gave him a collage of family photographs for a present.      \\"Tata (our father) is making this remarkable progress and we look forward to having him back home soon,\\" Zindzi said.      Grandson Ndaba Mandela was more cautious about Mandela's condition. \\"He's still critical ... he's just a lot more alert now, a lot more aware of his surroundings,\\" he told CBS News.      \\"FIRST CITIZEN\\"      Mandela Day celebrations in the United States included a special event at U.N. headquarters in New York, where figures such as former U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Reverend Jesse Jackson added their voices to the global tributes.      Clinton, a personal friend of Mandela, recalled the nearly three decades the nonagenarian spent in apartheid jails.      \\"Mandela walked out of prison after 27 years a greater man than he went in,\\" Clinton said. \\"Though he is old and frail and fighting for his life ... what is in his heart still glows in his smile and lights up the room through his eyes.\\"      Volunteers in New York handed out South African oranges.      In South Africa, Ethiopian and Nigerian asylum seekers who had settled their fleeing persecution and conflict in their own countries cleaned streets in Johannesburg expressed their praise for the personality considered \\"a father of Africa\\".      \\"In this country, Mandela is the reason all of us blacks are free, so that's why we love him as the first citizen,\\" said Kennedy Uzondu, 30, a Nigerian trader in South Africa.      Despite the adulation on his birthday, Mandela's post-apartheid 'Rainbow Nation' has not fulfilled all expectations.      Enormous gaps still persist in income, employment and access to education and these inequalities largely follow racial lines, according to the government's own data. White households in 2012 earn on average about six times more than black households.      Nevertheless, quality education and employment opportunities have also been opened up to tens of thousands of blacks.

In January 10, the batteries of the Nizam began bombarding the outer blockhouses of Chaul, reducing them to rubble after a few days. One such piece earned from the Portuguese the nickname \\"Orlando Furioso\\". At the same time, about 2,000 horsemen of the Nizam proceeded to devastate the lands owned by Portuguese around Bassein and Daman, but were repelled trying to assault a small Portuguese fort at Caranjá near Bombay, defended by 40 Portuguese soldiers. In February, a small fleet of 5 half-galleys and 25 smaller craft with 2,000 men from Calicut, commanded by Catiproca Marcá, arrived in Chaul to meet up with the forces of the Nizam, under cover from the night. The Portuguese had five galleys and eleven foists in the harbour, but the Malabarese avoided clashing with the Portuguese galleys. Fighting around Chaul broke down to trench warfare, as the army of Ahmadnagar dug trenches towards Portuguese lines to cover from their gunfire, amidst frequent Portuguese raids. The Portuguese dug counter-mines to neutralize them. In late February the Nizam ordered a general assault on the city, but was repelled with heavy losses, just as the Portuguese received important reinforcements by sea from Goa and Bassein. Fighting continued over the possession of the outer strongholds along the months of March, April and May, as the army of the Nizam suffered heavy casualties. Following a sortie of the Portuguese in April 11, the Nizam ordered the city to be subjected to a general bombardment, which demolished several strongholds and sunk the Viceroy's galley anchored in the harbour. In June 29, the Nizam ordered another mass assault but after six hours fighting, they were repelled, suffering over 3,000 dead. Following this setback, the Nizam requested peace on July 24, 1571, and withdrew his army. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - A photovoltaic cell is created with two layers of semiconductor material - The top layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; with impurities to allow a negative charge - The bottom layer are &#x27;doped&#x27; to allow for a positive charge - This produces an electric field that allows electrons to flow from negative to positve - Sunlight enters the cell - Energy from sunlight knocks electrons loose in both fields - This prevents the flow of electrons from negative to positive - Adding an external circuit allows the exchange to continue - Give the cells owner a flow of electricity.  Question: suppose less sunlight enters the cell happens, how will it affect electrons flow more.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When less sunlight enters the photovoltaic cell, it will result in fewer photons available to interact with the semiconductor material, specifically the electrons within the material. Consequently, fewer electrons will be knocked loose in both the negatively charged (n-type) layer and the positively charged (p-type) layer. This reduction in the number of free electrons directly correlates to a decrease in the amount of energy that can be converted by the photovoltaic cell. As mentioned in the process, sunlight is required to allow the energy from photons to dislodge electrons and prompt the flow of electricity. With less sunlight, there will be a reduced amount of energy available to initiate this process. In comparison to the original scenario with more sunlight, the process of transferring electrons from the n-type to the p-type layer will still occur, albeit at a slower rate or with fewer electrons being transferred. Therefore, the electric field's ability to facilitate electron flow from the negative to positive layer is comparatively less effective. Now, let's consider the second effect mentioned in the process - the prevention of electron flow from the negative to the positive layer. Under normal circumstances, energy from sunlight is responsible for knocking electrons loose in both layers to create free electrons, which then creates an electron-hole pair that prevents their flow from negative to positive. However, given that less sunlight is entering the cell, the rate at which electron-hole pairs are formed is reduced. When there are fewer electron-hole pairs, the hindrance to electron flow from the negative side to the positive side is weakened. However, since less sunlight also results in a diminished overall availability of free electrons to flow through the external circuit and generate electricity, the overall electrical output of the photovoltaic cell will be lower. In summary, in the case where less sunlight enters the photovoltaic cell, there will be less energy available to knock electrons loose in both the n-type and p-type layers, resulting in a reduced electric output. Although the second effect mentioned, the prevention of electron flow from negative to positive, is slightly mitigated by the decrease in electron-hole pairs, this does not increase the overall electricity produced by the cell due to fewer free electrons available for transfer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Good evening to all who are gathered on today for the commencement of Southwest High School’s 2017 graduating class. My name is Marvin Wright and I am delighted to be standing here as your senior class president.      First and foremost, I want to thank God for making all of this possible. Secondly, I would like to thank all of the parents and family members for the unconditional love you have provided my classmates and I during our unpredictable phases of life, for ultimately sticking with us through thick and thin, and giving us constant guidance. I would like to also thank the faculty and staff of Southwest for instilling knowledge and preparing us for the next chapter that we will soon embark on. And lastly, but certainly not least, I wouldl like to personally thank my mother, Jokita Wright, for all of the sacrifices you have made for my 2 siblings and I. Selfless, strong, determined, humorous, provider, protector are only a few attributes that exhibit who you are, which motivates me day to day. So, Thank you Mom! For without you I would not be standing here today.      Now, class of 2017.... this it it! We have finally made it. There are no other people I’d rather have spent my high school years with than all of you. Most of the students in our graduating class have known each other since elementary school, which is an accumulation of 13 consecutive years.      When we take a walk down memory lane we can all visualize ourselves being young, naïve, tiny elementary school kids who relied on nap time throughout Kindergarten, who look forward to recess every day, and counted down the days and minutes until the biggest event of elementary school…field day.      Then we moved onto middle school where things didn’t work in our favor, such as me not hitting my intended growth spurt. Middle school was a transition period of having your own locker, having multiple teachers, dress codes were challenged in trying to figure out how to come up with your own “style” by also following the uniform guidelines, and athletics became an outlet for students who sought competition.      Finally, we made it to high school. There was more freedom, better lunch choices, and opportunities for us to explore, to figure out who we are.      It seems like yesterday we were timid freshmen excited to be part of the mature crowd, but unsure where we would fit in. For many of us, our first year in high school was a time where the temptation to look at your cell phone was unbearable and sometimes we caved in, which resulted in us getting our phones taken. Or how about when we attended our first Friday Night Lights football game in which we were able to stay out late and hang with our friends.      Sophomore year then quickly approached us where we knew the routine and thought we knew it all, but in reality we were still being overlooked because we were still considered under classmen.      Junior year, reality sunk in. We did all that we could to build up our resume by being committed to our academics, participating in varsity sports, and taking leadership positions in different clubs. We also took the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the SAT and ACT, as well as faced the immense task of figuring out a timeline that will prepare us for after high school. I think it is safe to say that although junior year was the most stressful and challenging, it was the most rewarding.      Once the class of 2016 walked across the stage we were finally seniors! The year we had been dreaming of since freshmen year, was finally here. There was so many things to look forward to: seniority, senior prom, senior picnic, receiving our caps and gowns, and the list goes on. As seniors everything seemed different…teachers became mentors, friends became family, and Southwest High School became home. Little did we know that this year would come at a blink of an eye and the past four years would boil down to this day where all the hard work, laughs, tears, and long hours will have paid off.      Even though today is an accomplishment for the entire 2017 class and all of those who have helped us on this journey, it is going to take a lot of adjusting to get use to not seeing every single one of you on a daily basis. Even though I can't predict the future I know that we all have the ability to make a difference in this world. For you should have the mindset that not only will you graduate today, but everyday is a graduation. This ultimately means that graduation is a continuous process in which you should strive to true lifelong learning of continuous, self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for personal improvement.      I am no expert in this journey we call life but we all have the ability to make a difference and to be that change the world needs. The past 13 years have equipped us for a time as this to stand bold in who we are. So I say to my classmates, cherish these last few minutes we spend here and the memories we have created and get ready for the journey ahead.      Thank you guys for making my senior year better than I could ever imagine and for all the moments I will always hold dear to my heart. Thank you, and congratulations to the class of 2017!!! ||||| You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters      Message: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/18KAC      — High school graduation day should be a celebration, but for one Edgecombe County senior, it is a day he will never forget.      As Southwest Edgecombe County High School's senior class president, Marvin Wright was allowed to write a speech and read it aloud at graduation.      \\"I really worked hard on this speech,\\" he said.      Wright said on the day of graduation, he was told by school administrators that he would not be able to read his speech. He would have to read one the school wrote for him.      \\"I think my classmates would like to hear what I have to say instead of the one you wrote for me,\\" Wright said.      While on stage during the ceremony, Wright said he followed his heart and chose to read his speech instead.      Read Marvin Wright's full speech      In a video, the principal and other staff members are seen talking behind Wright, clearly upset he wasn't following orders given at graduation rehearsal.      \\"My thing to him was to follow your heart,\\" his mother, Jokita Wright said. \\"He put God first. He spoke about parents, his classmates and spoke about his mom.\\"      When Marvin Wright left the stage, he discovered the principal had taken his diploma.      \\"(He said) 'Mom, they took my diploma, they won't give it to me,'\\" Jokita Wright said. \\"At that moment I was totally upset. I was upset.\\"      \\"I only have one chance to graduate from high school and it was really an embarrassing moment,\\" said Marvin Wright.      Jada Barnes, a fellow classmate, called the principal's actions disrespectful.      \\"His diploma was taken...it was hurtful not only to him and his family, but to all of us,\\" Barnes said.      The school system gave no specific reason for wanting Wright to recite their simple, short paragraph.      Sources told WRAL News Wright's speech was too long and that he failed to meet an approval deadline. Wright said he was not aware of any deadline.      In a statement to WRAL News, a school spokesperson said there was nothing wrong with the content of Wright's speech.      \\"The expectation is that all graduation speakers read the speech that has been prepared and placed at the podium...It is very unfortunate that his diploma was pulled and it should not have happened. An apology has been issued to Marvin and his family,\\" the statement said.      Wright said that since it was a last-minute decision to read his speech, he did not have a hard copy and had to read it off his phone. This violated school guidelines.      Wright's principal, Craig Harris, hand-delivered his diploma to his home Sunday afternoon, and the superintendent apologized via phone. WRAL News reached out to school administrators for additional comments, but no additonal information was made availible.      Wright is now headed into the Navy this fall. ||||| Marvin Wright's high school diploma was withheld on June 9 after he refused to read a speech written by the school's administrators. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)      Marvin Wright, president of his high school senior class, spent two weeks working on his graduation speech, staying up till 5 on the morning of the event to finish.      But later that day, the principal of Southwest Edgecombe High in Pinetops, N.C., told him he would be giving a different address, a five-sentence paragraph prepared by the school administrators. He gave him no explanation.      “I felt robbed of a chance to say my own words,” Marvin, 18, told The Washington Post. His mother, classmates and teachers urged him to give his speech anyway.      When he stepped onto the stage at the end of the commencement ceremony Friday, he opened up a folder under the podium containing the school’s prepared remarks:      I would like to thank all of our friends and family for being here tonight. I would also like to address my fellow graduates one last time before we leave this gym. Although we may all never be in the same room at the same time again, we will always share the memories that we created within these walls. And no matter what we all do after graduation, never forget that this is one place that we all have in common, this place is home. Congratulations graduates, we did it!      But instead of delivering those words, he took out his cellphone and read a copy of his original speech, with his friends in the audience nodding to him in encouragement.      Sitting behind Marvin, the principal, Craig Harris, immediately turned to another staff member, whispering with a look of disapproval, video footage shows.      After the applause and final procession, all of the students lined up to receive their official diplomas. But one folder in the stack was missing: Marvin’s. His senior adviser informed him the principal had removed the diploma because Marvin had read the wrong speech.      “All my friends were outside with their big yellow folders taking pictures and I was still inside, trying to get my diploma,” Marvin said. “I was really hurt and embarrassed, basically humiliated.”      The teenager and his mother, Jokita Wright, accused the school of not only censoring a student’s words but then retaliating against him by withholding his diploma. The mother complained to the principal, who explained to her that her son had missed a deadline to submit the speech to the school. Marvin says he never knew about it.      Marvin did not receive his diploma for another two days, when the principal dropped it off at his home at the request of the superintendent. The principal handed him the diploma, saying only, “If your mom has any questions just give me a call.” Then he left.      [N.Y. subway breakdown inspires makeshift graduation on the E train]      Edgecombe County Schools Superintendent John Farrelly called Marvin on Monday to apologize for the way the school handled the situation on commencement day.      “I have communicated with the family to apologize on behalf of the school,” Farrelly said in a statement to the Wilson Times. “The diploma never should have been taken from the student.”      Farrelly said he did not have any problems with the content of the teenager’s speech but was concerned about Marvin’s use of a cellphone and the decision to change course at the last minute.      “There is an expectation that is communicated to all graduation speakers that the prepared and practiced speech is the speech to be delivered during the ceremony,” Farrelly said. “That was made extremely clear to the speakers. The student did not follow those expectations.”      In the fall, when Marvin was elected senior class president, his adviser informed him he would have to write a graduation speech. He says he wasn’t given any guidance, so he sought out tips from the previous year’s senior class president, and listened to numerous commencement speeches online for ideas.      His English teacher told him she approved of the speech. Marvin even left a copy of the remarks on his principal’s desk for review on commencement day.      Still, administrators insisted he should read the address they prepared.      But Marvin gave the speech he wanted to give, recounting memories he shared with his classmates through elementary, middle and high school. Though he stumbled a few times — distracted by the conversations taking place behind him and struggling to read from his phone — Marvin’s speech was welcomed with cheers and laughs from the audience.      [ICE nabs teenager hours before his senior prom, days before his graduation ceremony]      In his approximately five-minute address, he thanked God, the family members of the graduates, the school’s faculty and his mom — who was watching in the bleachers in tears.      “This is it,” Marvin said. “We have finally made it.”      He talked about playing at recess in elementary school, dealing with the “transition period” of middle school, when “things didn’t work out in our favor.”      Finally, he talked about his senior year.      “Everything seemed different,” he said. “Teachers became mentors, friends became family, and Southwest Edgecombe High became home.”      “I am no expert in this journey we call life, but we all have the ability to make a difference and to be that change the world needs,” Wright continued. “The past 13 years have equipped us for a time as this to stand bold in who we are. So I say to my classmates, cherish these last few minutes we spend here and the memories we have created and get ready for the journey ahead.”      Marvin was his mother’s last child to graduate high school. His relatives drove to watch him speak and receive his diploma. While she’s glad he gave an address in his own words, Jokita Wright wished her son could have left the school that day with the diploma he rightfully earned, she said.      “He can’t get that day back,” his mother said. “That was a special moment for me, it was a special moment for him.”      Luckily, Marvin received the diploma just in time for the day he needed it most. On Monday, he officially committed to entering the U.S. Navy, after which he hopes to study pediatric surgery.      The high school graduate will report for duty on Oct. 10. ||||| Thank you for being one of our most loyal readers. Please consider supporting community journalism by subscribing.

Despite spending two weeks writing and perfecting his commencement speech, he was told by the school principal, Craig Harris, that he had to read a speech written by the school administrators instead. The school's decision to replace Marvin's speech was allegedly due to its length and because he failed to meet an approval deadline - a deadline Marvin claims he was unaware of.  Nonetheless, Marvin decided to follow his heart and read his original speech instead of the one provided by the school. As a result, his diploma was temporarily withheld after the ceremony, causing him embarrassment. Marvin's mother spoke with the principal, who eventually returned the diploma after an apology from the school superintendent, John Farrelly. Farrelly stated that while there was no issue with the content of Marvin's speech, his use of a cellphone and last-minute change were the main concerns.  Marvin's speech thanked his classmates, teachers, family, and friends for the years they spent growing and learning together. He highlighted the highs and lows of their time at Southwest High School and encouraged his peers to embrace the future and make a difference in the world. His diploma was returned just in time for him to officially commit to the U.S. Navy, where he plans to study pediatric surgery after completing his service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Though the iPod was released in 2001, its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004. The iPod line came from Apple's \\"digital hub\\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \\"big and clunky or small and useless\\" with user interfaces that were \\"unbelievably awful,\\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone.

But aside from the usual displays of canine agility and obedience, what have been the stand-out moments of the Birmingham-based event? 1. When it comes to accessories, less is more Whether you think they're cute or cringeworthy, dogs with hair bows risked being disqualified this year. Pat Maul, a shih tzu judge, said any dogs with \\"bows\\" or \\"adornments\\" would be refused from the ring. Her recommendation that owners use a \\"plain elastic band holding the topknot only please\\" was prompted by new rules set out by the Kennel Club, which runs Crufts. 2. This year's fashion must-have: Dog onesies It may be March but cosy \\"onesies\\" were spotted on many a fashion-forward dog at the four-day event, including this tiger print number. Other owners stuck to the more-traditional dog jacket. 3. Youngest ever Crufts handler? Jessica Allen, four, was the youngest dog handler at Crufts 2017 when she competed with her pet terrier Cariad - who is a year older than her. The Kennel Club said it thought Jessica, from Stafford, was the youngest person ever to have taken part in the 125-year-old competition. \\"As soon as she could walk she was into dogs,\\" said her mother, Felicity Freer. \\"It brought a tear to my eye\\". 4.

Caddie and his owner, Joel, are finalists in the Crufts Friends for Life hero dog competition. 5. Public displays of affection Crufts isn't all serious, as these pictures of pedigree pets and their owners show. 6. But breeding remains an issue Crufts comes with its fair share of controversy, with some people claiming it does not place enough emphasis on the welfare of dogs. Campaign group Peta said the show was \\"all about celebrating dogs who have been bred by humans to have unnatural, exaggerated features\\". Last year, a German Shepherd with a sloped back appeared to struggle walking was awarded a Best in Breed prize. The Kennel Club has said dogs can only be exhibited if they can \\"stand freely and unsupported\\" and show \\"structural balance\\". It has also said that it takes any cases of animal cruelty seriously.

Republicans say seniors would still have the choice of remaining in the traditional government-run Medicare program, but Democrats view the GOP plan as a transition that would shift future cost increases in medical care to seniors.

However, it seems to be incomplete on its own. If it's an independent sentence, it must end with a period to complete the sentence.

When it comes to English grammar, periods are used to indicate the end of a sentence, which is the full expression of a single thought.

Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

Q: I heard that Cameron believed Ash's hazel eyes even though there wasn't any direct evidence for the fact.  And I was wondering How would Cameron feel afterwards? A:","output":"To determine how Cameron would feel after believing Ash's hazel eyes without any direct evidence, we will follow these steps: 1. Consider Cameron's personality traits and how they relate to trust and beliefs. 2. Analyze the context of the situation and the relationship between Cameron and Ash. 3. Reflect on the potential outcomes of the belief and how they could impact Cameron's emotions. Step 1: Considering Cameron's personality traits Let's assume that Cameron is a trusting person who tends to believe people, even without concrete evidence. This characteristic could make them more likely to believe Ash's hazel eyes claim without needing proof. Step 2: Analyzing the context and the relationship between Cameron and Ash Now, we need to understand the context of the situation and the nature of their relationship. If Cameron and Ash are close friends, it's more likely that Cameron trusts Ash and their feelings about the hazel eyes. If they are strangers or acquaintances, Cameron might feel more uncertain. Step 3: Reflecting on potential outcomes and their emotional impact on Cameron Lastly, we need to consider how believing Ash's hazel eyes without evidence could play out. There are a few possible scenarios here: - Scenario 1: Ash is telling the truth, and Cameron feels satisfied and glad that they trusted their friend. - Scenario 2: Cameron discovers evidence later that corroborates Ash's claim, leading to a sense of relief and validation. - Scenario 3: Cameron learns that Ash was not being truthful or was mistaken, leading to feelings of betrayal and disappointment. Conclusion: Cameron's feelings after believing Ash's hazel eyes without direct evidence would depend on their personality, the context of the situation, and the outcomes of the belief. If Cameron is naturally trusting and the outcome is positive, they will likely feel satisfied and trusting. If the outcome reveals that Ash was untruthful or mistaken, Cameron might feel disappointed or betrayed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A team of masked robbers, dressed as painters who call each other by variants of the name \\"Steve\\", seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the employees and patrons hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms.

The police supply pizzas whose boxes include listening devices; these pick up a language which the police finally identify as Albanian.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva.  - The Prättigau Valley, in the canton of Graubünden (Grisons), Switzerland, is home to the world-famous ski resorts of Klosters and neighbouring Davos in the Landwasser Valley.  At its heart is the river Landquart. The valley extends upwards from Landquart, a key transport terminal just north of Chur, the capital of Grisons.

The Swiss-Austrian border follows the historical bed of the Rhine, but today the river follows an artificial canal within Austria for the final . The Rhine Valley in this area extends to about . Its upper third has the character of an Alpine valley, enclosing a bottom plain of about across. Downstream of Vaduz, the valley widens considerably, developing into a broad plain, measuring some across at its lower end along the southern shores of Lake Constance. From the point of the Rhine's emergence from Lake Constance, it is known as High Rhine.

The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the school that was attended by the person who was notable for being involved in the Profumo affair?  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

As they work to gather local residents' accounts of the site's utilization, their efforts exemplify the ongoing struggle between economic progress and environmental conservation. Background and Context In a bid to accommodate the growing traffic demands and improve motorist experiences, plans for a new, state-of-the-art £40 million service station near the M1 have been revealed. This development, while promising economic gains and better roadside facilities, presents significant potential repercussions for the surrounding environment and local communities. The proposed site, which is located within a pristine and biodiverse woodland area, has long been a natural refuge, a haven for wildlife, and a cherished leisure space for nearby residents. Faced with potential negative impacts on the environment and local quality of life, campaigners have taken up the mantle of protecting the woodland from destruction. They now seek to present compelling evidence demonstrating the importance and widespread use of the woodland by residents, hoping to protect its integrity and support sustainable alternatives. Perspectives of the Campaigners At the heart of the campaigners' arguments is the value of preserving the natural environment for present and future generations. For them, safeguarding the woodland from encroaching development is about defending a natural legacy, nurturing a healthy relationship with nature, and promoting an ecologically sound vision for the future. Critics of the service station proposal point to a range of environmental concerns, including: 1. Habitat Destruction: The construction of a large commercial facility in a wooded area would invariably result in significant habitat loss. This could lead to the displacement or even extinction of local fauna and flora, ultimately disrupting the delicate balance of the woodland ecosystem. 2. Pollution: The introduction of a service station would mean an increase in pollution from vehicle emissions and lighting, further degrading the quality of the local environment. This could have ripple effects on surrounding habitats, impacting air and water quality and wildlife health. 3. Urban Sprawl and Loss of Green Spaces: The development of a service station could trigger urban sprawl, as other businesses and infrastructure projects follow suit. This could lead to further loss of green spaces and undermine local efforts to preserve biodiversity, reduce pollution, and ensure access to natural spaces for recreation and relaxation. The Evidence-Gathering Effort In their appeal for evidence of the site's use by residents, the campaigners are pursuing a two-pronged approach: 1. Collecting Testimonies: Compiling personal stories, accounts, and experiences of local residents who have long enjoyed the picturesque woodland can effectively paint a vivid picture of the site's cultural and social significance, bolstering the case for its preservation. 2. Documenting Recreational Use: Gathering data on the frequency, variety, and types of recreational activities that take place in the woodland, such as hiking, birdwatching, and picnicking, can illustrate the significant role the area plays in promoting wellbeing and fostering community connections. Considering Alternative Solutions As public sentiment and global trends increasingly lean toward environmentally-conscious policies and urban planning, exploring alternative solutions that prioritize sustainable growth becomes all the more pressing. In the case of the £40m service station, this might mean identifying alternative locations that present fewer ecological risks or investing in greener infrastructure to minimize environmental impact. Conclusion The passionate campaign driven by concerned residents against the £40m service station development highlights an ongoing tension between modern development plans and environmental preservation. As they gather evidence to support their case and present feasible alternatives, these campaigners encourage a broader conversation about our collective responsibility to value and protect our natural landscapes for the sake of a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: According to the Internal Revenue Service, a FMV is an estimate of the sales amount that a private seller and buyer would agree to for a vehicle. In contrast, a trade-in value is what a dealership would offer. It’s also important to note that the FMV is calculated based on the actions of willing buyers/sellers, not ones under duress. Trade-in values for used cars are also often altered by dealers to boost vehicle sales. An FMV estimate is more consistent.

Stochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by von Neumann in 1953. However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.

In our everyday lives whenever we meet people, we always try to judge them in terms of their statuses. For example, we must judge whether the person in the library is a reader or a librarian, whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman and so on. Our statuses often vary with the people we meet, and change through life. Most of us can, at very high speed, assume  the different statuses that various situations require. Much of social communication consists of recognizing and selecting among proper statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us. This means that we fit our actions to those of other people, based on a constant mental process of assessment and understanding. Although some of us find the task more difficult than others, most of us perform _ rather easily. A status has been compared to ready-made clothes. Within certain limits the buyer can choose style and material. But an American is not free to choose the clothes of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince. We must choose from among the clothing presented by our society. Furthermore, our choice is limited to a size that will fit, as well as by our wallet. Having made a choice within these limits, we can have certain changes made. But apart from small adjustments, we tend to be limited to what the stores have on their shelves. Statuses too come ready-made, and the range of choice among them is limited. Question: What can be the best title for this text? Options: A: Proper Relations. B: Limited Choices.

Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between 1880 and 1910, emerging in Japan in the 1920s.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights.

Today, I want to tell you about a really cool rugby game that happened. Sometimes, when we watch our favorite sports, we see exciting matches where teams work super hard and win in the end. That's exactly what happened in this rugby game! In the beginning, there were two rugby teams that were going to play a game. One team was called Connacht, and the other team was called Newport Gwent Dragons. Both teams were really good at playing rugby, and they both really wanted to win. The name of the competition they were playing in is called Pro12. Do you know how rugby is played? It's like when you and your friends are playing tag, but there's also a ball you need to run with, and sometimes you need to catch it or pass it to your friends on the same team. It's really fun, and sometimes the games can be really close, just like this one. During this rugby game, the Newport Gwent Dragons were playing really well at the start. But the Connacht team didn't give up. They kept trying and working hard, just like how you should never give up when you're playing a game or doing a task. Then, something amazing happened! The Connacht team started to play even better, and they started to score more points, which means they were getting closer and closer to winning the game. This is called a \\"late surge\\" because they started playing better later in the game. At the end of the game, Connacht continued to play really well and even scored some extra points. This is called a \\"bonus-point win\\" because they got more points than they needed to win the game. It was a really big victory for Connacht, and now they moved to the top of the Pro12 competition. So, what can we learn from this great rugby game? It's important to never give up and always try your best, just like the Connacht team did! And when you and your friends play games together or do anything else in life, remember that working hard and never giving up can lead to big victories!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Close cooperation between regional law enforcement agencies and intelligence services was at the heart of the fight against terrorism, he said. Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\". Choices: -0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5","output":"Based on a close examination of the two sentences, it is clear that they convey a similar meaning. However, there are certain discrepancies that prevent them from being identical. Let us dissect each sentence to juxtapose their message. Sentence 1: \\"Close co-operation between law-enforcement agencies and intelligence services lie at the heart of the ongoing fight against terrorism,\\" Mr Howard said. In this sentence, Mr. Howard emphasizes the importance of \\"close co-operation\\" between law-enforcement agencies and intelligence services in the \\"ongoing\\" fight against terrorism. The term \\"ongoing\\" suggests that the battle is continuous and is still happening at the time of the statement. Sentence 2: Close cooperation between regional law enforcement agencies and intelligence services was at the heart of the fight against terrorism, he said. Here, Mr. Howard underscores the significance of \\"close cooperation\\" involving \\"regional law enforcement agencies\\" and intelligence services in the fight against terrorism. However, the use of \\"was\\" indicates a past event or a statement referring to a particular point in time. From this analysis, the key differences are: 1. Sentence 1 describes the cooperation as a crucial element in an \\"ongoing\\" fight against terrorism, while Sentence 2 alludes to a past event or a specific moment in time. 2. Sentence 2 specifically mentions \\"regional law enforcement agencies\\", adding a geographic aspect to the cooperation. In contrast, Sentence 1 does not specify the scope of the law enforcement agencies involved in the cooperation. Despite these differences, the overall message conveyed in both sentences—that close cooperation between law enforcement agencies and intelligence services is essential in combating terrorism—is quite similar. Consequently, on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", the comparison between these two sentences would be rated as a 4.

Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations.

While the app provides a clean user interface and solid messaging features such as end-to-end encryption, it struggles in areas like group management and media sharing. One of the aspects I appreciate most about this app is its dedication to privacy. The encryption feature offers a sense of security when discussing sensitive topics. Furthermore, the clean and straightforward user interface makes for a seamless and enjoyable messaging experience. I find the app's performance to be smooth, rarely experiencing any glitches or stutters on my device. However, the org.telegram.messenger app falls short when it comes to group management. As an admin, it often proves difficult to configure settings, moderate the chat, and keep track of members. Additionally, while the app does offer the ability to share various media files, this capability appears to be somewhat limited. I have occasionally experienced slow upload speeds and a lack of support for certain file formats, resulting in cumbersome exchanges with others. In conclusion, the org.telegram.messenger app delivers satisfactory performance in most areas, but a few minor shortcomings prevent it from being a truly top-tier messaging service. With some targeted improvements to group management and media sharing, I believe this app could earn an even higher rating.

This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how to do spin painting OPT: -- place your canvas on a pottery wheel, and slowly drip the paint as its spinning. -- place your canvas on a drill bit, and slowly pour paint on the drill while the canvas is spinning.","output":"Spin painting is an exciting and creative art technique that involves spinning a canvas while applying paint to create unique designs and patterns. The centrifugal force generated by the spinning motion distributes the paint, resulting in a mesmerizing, abstract artwork. Here are two methods you can use to create spin paintings, which include using a pottery wheel and a drill with detailed explanations: Method 1: Using a Pottery Wheel 1. Gather necessary materials: You'll need a pottery wheel, preferably with speed control, a canvas (choose a size that fits comfortably on the pottery wheel), acrylic or any liquid paint, paintbrushes, cups, and a drop cloth to protect your work surface. 2. Prepare your workspace: Lay out the drop cloth on the floor or table as spin painting can be quite messy. Set up the pottery wheel on the drop cloth and ensure it is securely fastened and stable. 3. Attach the canvas: Place your canvas on the pottery wheel's surface. You can use a non-slip mat, or if needed, some clay to hold the canvas in place and prevent it from sliding. Make sure the canvas is centered and secure. 4. Test the wheel's speed: Start spinning the pottery wheel at a low speed, adjusting it as needed. It's crucial to find a comfortable pace to work with; not too fast that the paint will fling off the canvas, and not too slow, so the paint migrates. 5. Apply the paint: Pour paint into cups and dilute slightly with water, if necessary, for a better flow. Begin spinning your canvas and slowly drip or pour paint onto the canvas using a brush, squeeze bottle, or directly from the cups. You can use multiple colors and layer them to create more depth and contrast. 6. Experiment with techniques: Try rotating the canvas at different speeds, using various paint application techniques, or tilting the canvas to manipulate the paint's flow.  7. Dry and finish: Once you achieve the desired look, stop the wheel and carefully remove the canvas. Allow the paint to dry completely; this may take several hours to a full day, depending on the paint's thickness. When dry, you can coat the painting with a varnish or sealant for added protection, if desired. Method 2: Using a Drill 1. Gather necessary materials: You'll need a drill (preferably cordless) with a flat drill bit or attachment that fits the canvas size, a spare bolt and wing nut, a canvas, acrylic or liquid paint, paintbrushes, cups, and a drop cloth to protect your work surface. 2. Prepare your workspace: Lay out the drop cloth on the floor or table and set up the drill. Make sure to keep the drill at a comfortable working height. 3. Attach the canvas: Drill a hole in the center of the canvas, then thread the bolt through the hole and secure it with the wing nut. Attach the bolt-end to the drill, making sure the canvas is centered and stable. 4. Test the drill's speed: Hold the drill firmly in place and steadily increase the speed. Adjust the speed to find a comfortable pace to work with, considering the canvas size and the flow of paint. 5. Apply the paint: Pour paint into cups and dilute slightly with water, if necessary, for better flow. Start spinning the canvas by turning on the drill. Slowly drip, pour, or use brushes to apply paint onto the spinning canvas. You may want to wear protective gloves to avoid paint splatter. 6. Experiment with techniques: Vary the canvas's spinning speed and use different paint application methods to create unique designs, patterns, and color combinations. 7. Dry and finish: Once satisfied with your painting, stop the drill and carefully remove the canvas from the attachment. Allow the paint to dry completely. When dry, you can coat the painting with a varnish or sealant for added protection, if desired. Both methods offer different experiences, and experimenting with each one will allow you to find your unique spin painting style.

The correct answer is that Thames Water could now launch an appeal against the decision because they are the ones affected by Ofwat's decision to block the eight per cent rise in water bills. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Mailonline is a news organization, and the decision of the water regulator does not directly affect them. - Matt Chorley is a journalist and not a party involved in the decision-making process, so he would not be appealing the decision. - Ofgem is the regulator for gas and electricity; it is not involved in water regulation decisions and would not have a reason to appeal this decision. - Ofwat is the water regulator that made the decision to block the price increase, so it would not appeal its own decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Thebaid ( ; Latin: \\"Thēbaïs\\") is a Latin epic in 12 books written in dactylic hexameter by Publius Papinius Statius (AD c. 45 – c. 96). The poem deals with the Theban cycle and treats the assault of the seven champions of Argos against the city of Thebes. Can we draw the following conclusion? The poem treats the assault of the seven champions.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the poem treats the assault of the seven champions, but it is important to delve deeper into the context, themes, and structure of the epic to gain a better understanding of its complexities and the story it narrates. The Thebaid, written by the ancient Roman poet Publius Papinius Statius circa 45-96 AD, is an epic poem consisting of 12 books. It is composed in dactylic hexameter, a metrical pattern commonly used in epic poetry. The poem centers around the Theban cycle, which is a collection of myths and legends pivoting on the city of Thebes in ancient Greece. The main story of the Thebaid revolves around the events leading to the assault on the city of Thebes by seven champions of Argos. These events unfold as the result of a power struggle between two brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, who are both sons of King Oedipus of Thebes. When their father is forced into exile after his destined tragic events, his curse casts its dark shadow on the sons, leading them to engage in a struggle for the throne of Thebes. The brothers strike a deal to alternate their rule each year. However, Eteocles refuses to yield the throne to Polynices after his year is up, which sets the stage for the epic battle that is the focus of the poem. Polynices, feeling betrayed, flees to the city of Argos, where he seeks the support of King Adrastus. The king agrees to aid Polynices in his quest to reclaim the throne of Thebes, and together, they assemble a mighty force. This army is composed of seven champions - each representing and leading a great contingent of warriors - to attack the seven gates of Thebes. Throughout the poem, Statius incorporates various themes and motifs common in Greco-Roman epic poetry, such as divine intervention, heroism, family bonds, and fate. The seven champions themselves are portrayed as heroes, each with their own unique skills, attributes, and personal history. These seven champions include Polynices, Tydeus, Amphiaraus, Capaneus, Hippomedon, Parthenopaeus, and Eteoclus. Their respective destinies, individual goals, and interpersonal relationships intertwine to form the epic narrative of the Thebaid. In conclusion, the poem indeed treats the assault of the seven champions, as it narrates the story of their assault on the city of Thebes in an attempt to overthrow the rule of Eteocles and to place Polynices on the throne. The Thebaid, with its complex characters and multifaceted themes, explores the nature of power, loyalty, fate, and heroism as it offers readers a rich and elaborate account of the events involved in the Theban cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems.  - The , stylized as NINTENDO and often referred to as N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is the industry's last major successive home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, as all succeeding home consoles up until the Nintendo Switch used an optical format. In addition, current handheld systems (such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003.  - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - Body Blows is an Amiga versus fighting game. It was released in 1993 by Team17. The game is compatible with all Amiga systems, including the CDTV system with joystick support. It was followed by \\"Body Blows Galactic\\" and \\"Ultimate Body Blows\\". A version for DOS was also released.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - The is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe as the successor to the successful Sega Genesis. The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original titles.  - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS.

A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems.  - Body Blows Galactic is a fighting game developed and published by Team17 in for the Amiga computers. It is a sequel to 1992's \\"Body Blows\\". Opponents and background graphics from both games were later merged into the compilation release \\"Ultimate Body Blows\\".  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86.

In his tent on the beach, Zurga notes that the storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (\\"L'orage est calmé\\"). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (\\"Je suis jaloux\\"). Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace. Outside the temple, Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn and the coming double execution (\\"Dès que le soleil\\"). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals that he is the man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee.

Speer and Murphy were once good friends, which changed after Murphy left the force.[1] On a rainy night, Speer comes to a diner for coffee. Two goons arrive, looking for Murphy. They pounce the minute Murphy arrives, starting a fistfight. Speer, no fan of Murphy's, ignores the fight until a goon causes him to spill his coffee. Both goons are thrown through the front door. Murphy sarcastically thanks Speer for saving his life. The two rivals have eyes for Murphy's secretary Addy (Jane Alexander).

OPTIONS:  A). no  B). yes","output":"A). No, the questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"What is the world’s best tongue twister?\\" seeks an answer identifying the most challenging or well-known tongue twister in the world. A tongue twister is a phrase that is designed to be difficult to articulate properly, particularly when repeated quickly. They often rely on similar but distinct phonemes or rapid shifts in pronunciation. One contender for the world's best tongue twister is the Guinness World Record holder, \\"The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick.\\" This tongue twister is considered the most difficult to articulate due to its phonetic complexity and the repetitive use of similar but distinct sounds that can easily trip up the speaker. Another popular tongue twister, often cited as one of the most difficult, is, \\"How can a clam cram in a clean cream can?\\" This tongue twister combines a variety of similar consonants and vowel sounds, making it challenging to pronounce accurately and quickly. However, the concept of the \\"world's best\\" tongue twister is subjective, as people might consider different factors that determine the difficulty and effectiveness of a tongue twister. The second question, \\"Why do we have tongue twisters?\\" explores the reason behind the existence of tongue twisters in language and culture. There are several reasons why tongue twisters exist and continue to be popular: 1. Linguistic curiosity: Tongue twisters play with the phonetic features of languages. They challenge the brain and the speaker's ability to manipulate and produce complex linguistic combinations. By experimenting with various combinations of sounds and words, tongue twisters offer an insight into the flexibility and intricacies of human language. 2. Language learning and practice: They can be used as a fun and informal way to practice pronunciation, diction, and fluency in speaking. They help speakers become more aware of their articulatory habits and can improve precision in pronunciation and enunciation of specific phonemes. 3. Brain and speech development: Tongue twisters can contribute to the development of cognitive skills, such as memory, attention, and focus. They can also help in speech therapy, fostering motor coordination and control over the articulators involved in speech production, benefiting those with speech impediments or difficulties. 4. Entertainment and social interaction: Tongue twisters have long been a popular form of amusement. They serve as an engaging challenge that can be shared in a group setting, fostering laughter and connection among people who attempt to say them correctly and quickly. In conclusion, the two questions are different in terms of meaning, as the first one asks for the identification of the world's best tongue twister, while the second one seeks the reasons and purposes behind the existence of tongue twisters in language and culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The bed should be reserved as a place for sleep, but people tend to read an iPad a lot in bed before they go to sleep. Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues got a small group of people for an experiment. For five days in a row, the people read either a paper book or an iPad for four hours before sleep. Their sleep patterns were monitored all night. Before and after each trial period, the people took hourly blood tests to paint a day-long picture of just how much melatonin   was in their blood at any given time. When subjects read on the iPad as compared to the paper books, they reported feeling less sleepy at night and less active the following morning. People also took longer to fall asleep on the iPad nights, and the blood tests showed that their melatonin secretion   was delayed by an hour and a half. The researchers conclude in today's journal article that given the rise of e-readers and the increasingly widespread use of e-things among children and adolescents, more research into the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed. Czeisler and colleagues go on, in the research paper, to note:\\"Reading an iPad in bed may increase cancer risk.\\" However, software has been developed that can reduce some of the blue light from the screens of phones and computers according to time of day, and there are also glasses that are made to filter   short wavelengths.

This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers:  This short has a \\"story\\" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here. My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ. The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were. This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. Recommended, particularly if you like good animation.

Breakdown: First I identify the different parts of the sentence. The subject is \\"A new security system\\", the action or verb is \\"is being developed\\", and the location \\"in the buildings housing the Turkish parliament in Ankara.\\"  2. Translation: The next step involves translating each segment to Turkish: - \\"A new security system\\" translates to \\"Yeni bir güvenlik sistemi\\" - \\"is being developed\\" translates to \\"geliştiriliyor\\" - \\"in the buildings housing the Turkish parliament in Ankara.\\" translates to \\"Ankara'daki Türk parlamentosunu barındıran binalarda.\\" 3. Reassembly: In Turkish, the sentence structure slightly differs; it generally follows the subject-object-verb (SOV) turnover. Hence, the sentence would be reassembled as:  \\"Ankara'daki Türk parlamentosunu barındıran binalarda yeni bir güvenlik sistemi geliştiriliyor.\\" So, \\"A new security system is being developed in the buildings housing the Turkish parliament in Ankara.\\" translates to \\"Ankara'daki Türk parlamentosunu barındıran binalarda yeni bir güvenlik sistemi geliştiriliyor.\\" in Turkish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The only complaint Jose Mourinho could possibly have after this astonishingly one-sided contest was the fact that there was so little to complain about. Not a hint of controversy. Not a booking he could blame on a referee. Barely a misplaced pass that might have given him an excuse to criticise one of his players. It was, Mourinho was moved to declare, a perfect performance from his Chelsea side; a ‘perfect game’ with no possible reason to cry conspiracy or point to an ongoing campaign against his team. He could not even moan about Wilfried Bony’s transfer to Manchester City when the absence of the Ivorian striker was clearly to Chelsea’s advantage.

Instead, a stunned Liberty Stadium witnessed Chelsea returning to the campaign that remains Mourinho’s true focus beyond the diversionary tactics of his recent outbursts; the campaign to propel his side back to the summit of the English game. However strong Manchester City might be, Chelsea will be hard to stop on this evidence. This time two first-half goals apiece for Oscar and Diego Costa and a further second-half strike from Andre Schurrle secured three more points, with some quite extraordinary defensive errors contributing to Swansea’s demise. But to suggest simply that Swansea were the architects of their own downfall would be to seriously undervalue just how wonderful a performance this was from the Premier League leaders. Swansea were awful. ‘Horrible’ was how Garry Monk described a first 45 minutes he rated their worst of the season.

Mourinho has assembled the Chelsea side we are enjoying this season and right now they are playing as well — and as attractively — as any team in Europe. The manager was invited to praise Costa and Oscar afterwards but he quite rightly pointed to the fact that every player in the side deserved praise. He mentioned John Terry, Filipe Luis and Branislav Ivanovic in response but he could just have easily pointed to the commanding midfield display of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic. The finishing of Oscar and Costa was nevertheless superb. The opening Chelsea goal, scored after just 49 seconds, might have owed much to Gylfi Sigurdsson’s wayward pass — one seemingly intended for Ashley Williams but one that was diverted into the path of Oscar when it struck Tom Carroll — but it remained a marvellous strike. There was the briefest glimpse of a riposte when Sigurdsson sent a shot crashing against the angle of post and crossbar in the second minute but after that Swansea pretty much folded. When Fabregas, so composed and confident alongside the marvellous Matic, executed a delightful one-two with Willian before feeding the ball into Costa, goal number two arrived in the 20th minute. Costa, much like Oscar, produced a fierce, low finish Lukasz Fabianski was powerless to stop. Chelsea were so in control, with Willian seeing one shot bounce off a post and another rebound off the crossbar. But when Federico Fernandez contrived in the 34th minute to knock a back-pass into the path of Costa, the Spaniard extended Chelsea’s lead with another deadly strike.

For Monk it was clearly proving very painful, Swansea’s manager watching in despair as another goal arrived within two minutes. This time Willian sparked the move with a burst from midfield and a delightful pass out to Costa on the right flank, with Costa then delivering to the ball into the path of a rapidly advancing Oscar and so inviting the Brazilian to smash it home. He did so with ease. It enabled Chelsea to stroll through the second half, even if there was a moment when Costa and Williams threatened to become embroiled in an ugly exchange. But it remained a game without controversy and without much of a fight from the hosts. With one eye on Tuesday’s League Cup encounter at Liverpool, Mourinho eventually made changes. But a fifth Chelsea goal, scored in the 79th minute, still came, with Eden Hazard and Ivanovic inviting Schurrle to compound Swansea’s misery from close range.

Premise: 1. The speaker may run out of money at the end of the month. 2. If there is no money, no milk will be purchased. Hypothesis: 1. There is no need to worry about money. The hypothesis claims a state of financial stability and no need to worry about money. However, the premise explicitly states two facts - one of which is the speaker running out of money at the end of the month. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis, as the speaker's experience suggests that there is a financial concern. The second part of the premise states a logical event that follows the previous condition - if there's no money, no milk will be purchased. It further emphasizes the significance of money in this scenario and possibly hints at a monthly occurrence where this individual runs out of funds, leading to a lack of essential items like milk. Upon examining the links between the assertions in the premise and the hypothesis, it is obvious that there is no entailment between the two. The hypothesis suggests a state of no worry about money, while the premise explicitly highlights a concern regarding money.

Scottish midfielder has started just five games this season. Adam has been linked with a move to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.","output":"Title: Scottish Midfielder Charlie Adam Considering Moving Abroad Amidst Limited Game Time Body: Scottish midfielder Charlie Adam has recently expressed his openness to moving abroad in search of more game time as his appearances for his current club have been limited this season. The talented playmaker has only managed to start in five games so far, sparking discussions about his future and possible destinations. One club that has gained attention in regards to Adam's possible transfer is David Moyes' Real Sociedad, as the former Premier League manager looks to rebuild his team around experienced campaigners. Charlie Adam, 35, began his professional career in Scotland with Rangers before enjoying stints at Blackpool and Stoke City subsequently. He quickly gained a reputation as both a goal-scoring midfielder and reliable creator with a lethal left foot. Despite his advanced age, Adam still possesses the qualities that made him a valuable asset for his former clubs, including top-notch set pieces and a keen eye for a defense-splitting pass. However, his limited game time this season has raised concerns among fans and pundits alike that Adam needs a change of scenery to fully utilize his skills. The prospect of moving abroad could offer the Scottish veteran a new lease on life and rejuvenate his career, as adapting to different leagues and playing styles can indeed be a challenge, but a fruitful one at that. A potential move to David Moyes' Real Sociedad has been making headlines, as Moyes' familiarity with the Scottish Premiership during his time as manager at Everton and Manchester United could be an attractive factor for Adam. Real Sociedad, a Spanish side that competes in La Liga, has historically been known for its development of young talent, but the presence of experienced players like Adam could add some much-needed depth and tactical knowledge to the squad. Having previously worked with Premier League talent, Moyes is well aware of the skillset that Adam could bring to a team, and his ability to foster resilience and determination may be what the Spanish side needs to push for domestic success. If Adam does decide to move abroad, it will be a significant moment for Scottish football. For years, the country's most talented players have preferred to remain within the familiar surroundings of the United Kingdom, with a select few venturing into the European football scene. However, in recent times, there has been a slow but steady shift in mindset as Scottish players have started to acknowledge the potential benefits that playing abroad can offer, such as broadening footballing horizons and a diverse approach to the game. In conclusion, as Charlie Adam contemplates a potential move abroad in search of more game time, he is inadvertently paving the way for fellow Scottish talent to consider overseas ventures too. Not only could the midfielder's transfer to a team like Real Sociedad add an insightful touch to their setup, but it could also be a symbolic gesture for the evolution of Scottish football and potentially give Adam the chance to revitalize his distinguished career. Whatever the outcome, the Scottish football fraternity will be keenly watching Adam's next moves, as it could very well be a turning point in the midfielder's illustrious career."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: The Seattle Seahawks kicked off their 2013 campaign with a hard-fought, ugly win over the Carolina Panthers, 12-7. This game marked Russell Wilson's first 300-yard passing game, and Cam Newton's worst career performance, posting 125 yards through the air, a career low. The first quarter ended equal for both teams, as both sides exchanged a couple of punts. Seattle took their third drive of the game in the second quarter, and drove into the red zone, capping it with a Steven Hauschka 27-yard field goal. Carolina responded immediately, and taking advantage of a couple of Seattle penalties, and some big runs by DeAngelo Williams, with Cam Newton hitting Steve Smith for a 3-yard TD. Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but Charles Godfrey sacked Russell Wilson and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7-3, Carolina. The second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a Steven Hauschka 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7-6. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of Russell Wilson passes, followed by a Robert Turbin 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line. Russell Wilson overthrew receiver Stephen Williams on first down, but on second down and 10, by using exactly the same play, Wilson connected with second-year man Jermaine Kearse for a 43-yard score, with 10 minutes left to play. They failed the two-point conversion however, so Seattle had a 12-7 lead. Carolina responded by using DeAngelo Williams on some big runs. Inside the Seattle 35 yard line, Williams took off for a 24-yard scamper, and looked like he was going to score, however at the last possible moment, Earl Thomas forced Williams to fumble inside the 10 yard line. Who scored the most points, the Seahawks or the Panthers?","output":"Based on the context of the provided information, the Seattle Seahawks scored the most points in the game. They scored 12 points total, compared to the Carolina Panthers who scored 7 points. Reasoning: 1. I found information about point distribution for the Seattle Seahawks: a 27-yard field goal (3 points), a 40-yard field goal (3 points), and a 43-yard score (6 points). Adding up these points gives a total of 12 points. 2. For the Carolina Panthers, I found information about a 3-yard TD (Touchdown), which scores 7 points including the extra point.

Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in?

Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Embryo is C - Embryo grows and develops into a fetus inside the woman&#x27;s womb - The fetus is born - Begins to grow and develop through infancy and childhood - In the teenage years the human experiences puberty - Reaches sexual maturity - At 18 the human becomes an adult - Adult may procreate continuing the cycle. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the above process is: A - The successful fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down this entire process into its proper stages: A. Fertilization: This is the process in which a sperm cell from a male unites with an egg cell from a female during sexual reproduction. The fusion of these two cells, known as the spermatozoon and ovum, respectively, creates a single-celled, fertilized egg called a zygote. Fertilization typically takes place in the Fallopian tubes of the female reproductive system, after the sperm has traveled through the cervix and uterus. B. Creation of an Embryo (Embryo is C): The zygote starts to divide and multiply through the process of cellular replication called mitosis. This process continues as the cells undergo differentiation, which allows them to take on specialized roles and functions. This stage of growth and development forms an embryo, which will eventually develop into a fetus. C. Growth and Development inside the Woman's Womb: The embryo continues to grow and differentiate as it implants itself into the woman's uterine wall. The placenta, amniotic sac, and umbilical cord all form to provide nourishment and protection to the developing fetus. Throughout the pregnancy, the fetus will further develop all essential organs and body systems to prepare for life outside the womb. D. Birth of the Baby: Following a successful gestation period of approximately 40 weeks, the baby is born through the process of labor and delivery. The baby may be born via vaginal birth or cesarean section, depending on the specific circumstances of the pregnancy and the health of both the mother and baby. E. Growth and Development through Infancy and Childhood: After birth, the baby enters the stages of infancy and childhood, characterized by rapid growth, development, and various physical and cognitive milestones. During this time, they will learn to crawl, walk, talk, and achieve countless other developmental milestones as they gain more independence and understanding of the world around them. F. Puberty and Adolescence: As the child transitions into their teenage years, they will undergo puberty, a period marked by hormonal changes and the maturing of the body's reproductive system. Both males and females will experience physical changes, such as growth spurts, the development of secondary sexual characteristics, and emotional changes. G. Reaching Sexual Maturity: Upon completing puberty, individuals reach sexual maturity, meaning their bodies are capable of producing viable sperm or eggs for reproduction. This stage of life allows for the possibility of engaging in sexual activity and beginning the cycle anew through potential procreation. H. Adulthood and Potential Procreation: At the age of 18, individuals are typically considered adults, taking on new responsibilities, and potentially forming relationships that may lead to procreation. If a couple decides to have children, the cycle of life, as outlined above, continues, ensuring the ongoing development and survival of the human species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Great Britain, also known as Britain, is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest of the British Isles, the largest European island, and the ninth-largest island in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan.

On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company.

Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk.
