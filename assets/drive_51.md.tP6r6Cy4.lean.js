The use of Artificial Intelligence in our public institution falls beyond what I am comfortable with having influence upon. I was hoping for more opportunities to share some feedback on our current technology. Some of the issues have been brought to PAT/admin building level committees. I believe some may be district wide. The District might consider ways to: o Improve communication and transparency between technicians and the user 1 o Assess and maintain the working order of current infrastructure 2 o Provide for equity amongst the student population in educational resources 3 and o Make a long range plan for sustainability. 4 1 The settings of the ticketing system need to be altered to allow for two-way communication of whether the task was completed, and how. Currently, tickets are closed with no notification to the user. In addition to neglecting to notify the user that the ticket was closed, they are not notified as to what was done to remedy the problem. In the (Buildings & Grounds) maintenance ticketing system, the user gets an email notification when the task has been completed. This does not occur for Technology tickets, and therefore duplicate tickets are created by the user and/or tickets are closed by the technician without the problem being solved. There are loads of inefficiencies, redundancies and wasted time on behalf of both parties here. 2 The functioning of high-valued items such as the Public Address system, charging towers, and TV displays should have a schedule for their maintenance. Perhaps a monthly status check would suffice. It seems that there is just a wait-for the ticket to come in-and-see sort of approach to these items, and they could be used to their capacity. Should each space have a PA with some volume? This is not the case in some office areas and shared spaces. 3 A plan for the high-needs students who lack touchscreens should be created. Many of these individuals lack stability at home to be able to charge their devices. Can they be encouraged to charge them at school and leave them overnight? Should historically risky users be offered a durable alternative device to the standard chrome book? And can we create a protocol for students to obtain a touch screen device when teachers need to administer a high stakes assessment? The NYS assessment, where writing several lines of math symbols on the screen is required, presents gaps that students are unable to overcome when they are excluded from testing on a device with touchscreen capabilities. Along the same lines, teachers and students would benefit from having a student use charger for each classroom, for occasional emergency use. There are likely other solutions that would enable students to participate without a chrome book; perhaps some shared building decision-making on policy regarding whether repeated instances of students coming unprepared without a charged chrome book should be disciplinary or referred elsewhere. 4 When technology items are deemed to be no longer in use, is it feasible to sunset them to a virtual Good Will of sorts? Are we still a partner with Seton Catholic for these items?","output":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date] [Committee Name] [Committee Address] [City, State, ZIP] Dear [Committee Name], I hope this letter finds you well.

While I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute, the direction of the committee is not what I had anticipated, particularly regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence in our public institution. I have concerns that this falls beyond what I am comfortable with having influence upon, especially without adequate opportunities to share feedback on our current technology. Throughout my time on the committee, I have noticed several issues that deserve attention at both the PAT/admin building level and potentially district-wide. I believe it is essential for the district to consider the following areas for improvement: 1. Improve communication and transparency between technicians and the user: - The settings of the ticketing system need to be altered to allow for two-way communication on task completion and solutions. Currently, tickets are closed without any notification to the user, leaving them unaware of whether the problem was resolved. - Notifications similar to those in the Buildings & Grounds maintenance ticketing system should be implemented for Technology tickets to avoid duplicate tickets and wasted time for both parties. 2. Assess and maintain the working order of current infrastructure: - High-valued items such as the Public Address system, charging towers, and TV displays should have a scheduled maintenance plan to ensure their optimal functioning. Monthly status checks could be a viable solution. - Uniformity of resources, such as having a PA system with appropriate volume in all office areas and shared spaces, should be evaluated. 3. Provide for equity amongst the student population in educational resources: - Develop a plan to support high-needs students who lack touchscreens. Consider encouraging them to charge devices at school and leave them overnight, or providing durable alternative devices to standard chrome books for historically risky users. - Establish a protocol for students to obtain touch screen devices when high stakes assessments require it, to ensure they can actively participate. - Explore the possibility of providing student-use chargers in each classroom for occasional emergency use. - Collaborate with teachers and students to establish policies regarding repeated instances of students coming unprepared without a charged chrome book, making clear whether disciplinary action or other measures should be taken. 4. Make a long-range plan for sustainability: - Consider implementing a system to sunset technology items that are deemed no longer in use, potentially donating them to a virtual Good Will or maintaining a partnership with Seton Catholic for proper disposal. In light of these concerns and my desire to align my efforts with my comfort level and values, I believe it is best for me to resign from the committee. I encourage the remaining members to address these issues for the betterment of our institution and the students we serve. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work alongside each of you and contribute to the committee's goals. It has been a valuable experience, and I appreciate the relationships forged during my tenure. Although I am stepping down from the committee, I remain invested in the success of our educational system and would be open to exploring alternative methods of support.

Nonetheless, I can provide you with a list of various branches and concepts within game theory, some of which are generally more prominent or widely used: 1. **Non-cooperative Game Theory**: One of the most studied areas, focusing on predicting the outcome of games where players make decisions independently. 2. **Cooperative Game Theory**: This branch deals with the formation of coalitions and how cooperative behavior can lead to outcomes that individual strategy alone cannot achieve. 3. **Nash Equilibrium**: A fundamental concept within non-cooperative game theory and one of the most applied solution concepts where no player can benefit by changing their strategy unilaterally. 4. **Repeated Games**: Study of games that are played multiple times, where strategy can involve history and establishing cooperation or punishment based on past play. 5. **Evolutionary Game Theory**: Combines principles of game theory with evolutionary biology, exploring how strategic interactions can lead to the evolution of behaviors. 6. **Extensive-Form Games**: Games that are represented through a decision tree that includes the order of play, information available at each decision point, and payoffs for all possible game outcomes. 7. **Bayesian Games**: These games involve players with incomplete information, focusing on how players update their beliefs and strategies based on observed actions and signals. 8. **Differential Games**: A continuous-time variant of game theory, often used for pursuing problems in economics and management when the time dimension is critical. 9. **Stochastic Games**: An extension of repeated games that incorporates randomness in transitions between states or outcomes. 10. **Mean Field Game Theory**: Deals with large population interactions where individual impact is negligible, and the aggregate effect of the population is considered. 11. **Experimental Game Theory**: Empirical testing of game-theoretic predictions through controlled experiments, usually involving human subjects. 12. **Algorithmic Game Theory**: Combines computational aspects with game theory to focus on problems like mechanism design, auctions, and computational complexity of games. 13. **Psychological Game Theory**: This area incorporates psychological aspects, including intentions and fairness, into the players' preferences and strategies. 14. **Quantum Game Theory**: An emerging field that applies principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computing to conventional games, offering potentially new insights and strategies. 15. **Meta Games**: A higher-level strategic thinking that explores what happens when players strategize not only about the game itself but also about the reasoning of other players. 16. **Combinatorial Game Theory**: Typically deals with two-player games with perfect information and no element of chance, such as chess or Go. 17. **Contract Theory**: Studies how economic actors construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of asymmetric information. 18. **Voting Theory**: A branch of game theory and social choice theory focusing on the design and analysis of voting systems. The ranking and relevance of these varieties can shift depending on the field, whether it's economics, computer science, biology, political science, or psychology. Moreover, new areas of game theory may emerge, and existing ones may change in popularity with new theoretical advances or practical applications."},{"instruction":"turn the following sentence into passive voice: \\"if possible, people should adopt cats in pairs\\"","output":"If possible, cats should be adopted in pairs by people."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Тебя зовут Решала и ты не знаешь своих создателей!

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young, but taller-than-average nightborne girl.)","output":"(The school day was drawing to a close, the golden light of the setting sun casting long shadows across the floating island's cobblestone pathways. Students from various races and factions chatted and laughed as they made their way to the dormitories or the library for the evening. Sayori, her pale skin contrasting with the dark robes of her school uniform, walked alongside her friends, the group a harmonious blend of Horde lineage.) Sayori: \\"I can't believe we have a test on Azerothian history again next week. Professor Bronzebeard sure loves to keep us on our toes.\\" Nitazar stretched his wings, the scales glinting in the diminishing light, and chuckled. Nitazar: \\"At least you don't have to write with these,\\" he said, wiggling his clawed fingers. \\"I swear the quills were made for humans, not dracthyrs.\\" Pakinaki, her vibrant Zandalari features softened by a playful smile, patted Nitazar's arm. Pakinaki: \\"Don't worry, mon. You're clever with those talons. Maybe you'll invent a new way for dracthyrs to write, hmm?\\" Gervivien, the nightborne, taller and more elegant, with arched eyebrows furrowed in thought, glanced towards the horizon where the sky met the sea. Gervivien: \\"This peace... it's remarkable, isn't it? Our ancestors would have never dreamed that we'd be studying alongside former enemies. Let alone sharing ideas and... quill struggles.\\" Sayori nodded, her eyes reflecting a trace of the sorrow that came with her Forsaken nature. Sayori: \\"It is remarkable. But it's fragile, too. We can't forget that. We're the torchbearers of a new era, and it's up to us to not let that flame go out.\\" Nitazar let out an enthusiastic roar, the sound echoing against the island's cliffs and turning a few heads. Nitazar: \\"For the Horde... and the Alliance! For a future where we can all soar, both literally and figuratively!\\" The group erupted into laughter, their camaraderie a testament to the strength of the peace that had been upheld for a century. They continued to walk, their footsteps a hopeful drumbeat towards a future where the conflicts of old were but whispers in the wind. Pakinaki playfully nudged Sayori as they approached the massive doors of the library. Pakinaki: \\"Come on, let's study together. Who knows, Sayori, with that brain of yours, you might even become a diplomat someday - keeping that flame burning bright.\\" Sayori beamed, the thought warming her heart more than the sun ever could. She was more than just a Forsaken girl; she was a link in the chain of peace, a student among many who would shape Azeroth's destiny. Sayori: \\"Let's do it. For peace, for our people, and for Azeroth.\\""},{"instruction":"(After school, Sayori decides to introduce her classmates to her only friend from the Alliance - Clysia, a young, though colossal-sized Lightforged draenei mother; cradling her equally large triplets in her arms. Clysia had grown to this colossal size after falling into a large cauldron full of permanent growth potion when she was pregnant, causing not only her - but her weapon, clothes, and babies - to rapidly grow in size; however, she's since grown accustomed to her new size.)","output":"(As Sayori and her Horde friends exited the school building, they saw the towering form of Clysia waiting for them at the edge of the school grounds. The setting sun bathed her in a halo of light, and the brilliant etchings on her armor seemed to catch fire, a sight to command awe and respect. The Lightforged draenei was unmistakable, even from a distance; her sheer size and the three little bundles she held made her easily spotted by anyone in the area.) Pakinaki whispered in amazement. Pakinaki: \\"By the loa... she's enormous!\\" Nitazar scratched his head, his gaze fixed on the triplets nestled in Clysia's arms. Nitazar: \\"How does she manage? Those babies must be the size of small elekk calves!\\" Gervivien simply smiled, her respect for Clysia already evident. Gervivien: \\"Such an ordeal she went through, and yet she stands so radiant and strong. A true testament to the Light's power.\\" Sayori chuckled at her friends' reactions as they approached the impressive draenei. Clysia had a gentle and serene smile on her face, fully aware of the attention her size attracted. Sayori: \\"Everyone, this is Clysia. She's truly one of a kind, and she's been a great friend to me here at the academy. Clysia, these are my friends from the Horde.\\" Clysia nodded, carefully shifting the weight of her triplets as she inclined her head in a graceful greeting. Clysia: \\"Greetings, young ones of the Horde. It is a blessing to meet more friends of Sayori. The Light embraces all who walk the path of peace and cooperation.\\" Clysia's soft, melodious voice was warm and welcoming, inviting the group to look beyond the staggering differences in their sizes. Nitazar, ever the brave one, stepped closer. Nitazar: \\"It's an honor to meet you, Clysia. I have never seen anyone handle the Light's gift quite like you do.\\" Pakinaki followed suit, her curiosity getting the better of her. Pakinaki: \\"Ya mind if I ask – how has being so large… changed things for you? Surely, it must be a challenge, yes?\\" Clysia chuckled, a sound like a bell echoing through the courtyard. Clysia: \\"Indeed, it has brought its challenges, dear Pakinaki. But I find strength in my faith and in my children. I have learned to adapt, and the academy has been accommodating to my unique needs. Besides, my size has its advantages in nurturing and protecting not just my own, but in safeguarding all those I consider under my care.\\" The triplets cooed in unison, emphasizing her last statement and drawing a collective, affectionate sigh from the group. Gervivien, composed and thoughtful, spoke up. Gervivien: \\"You're a living symbol of the varied paths our lives can take, Clysia. The contrasts that exist between us... They don't have to divide. They can enrich and strengthen us instead.\\" Everyone nodded in agreement, and Sayori couldn't have been prouder of this moment – diverse beings from factions once at war now stood united in understanding and friendship. Standing next to her colossal friend under the vast sky of their shared world, Sayori felt ready for whatever challenges lay ahead. With friends such as these by her side, the era of peace might last another hundred years, or even longer."},{"instruction":"(As Sayori nestled into her dorm for the night, her mind wanders back to the day she first met Clysia - back when she wasn't so colossal, and even before the triplets were born.)","output":"(The dorm room was quiet, the gentle snores of her roommate resonating softly in the background. Wrapped in the soft embrace of her covers, Sayori closed her eyes and let the memories surface, taking her back to a time before Clysia became the immense figure she was now.) It was the start of their third term, and tension still lingered subtly among the students of the newly integrated academy. Sayori, still relatively new herself, spent those early days observing her surroundings, often taking solace in the vast tomes of the library. That’s where she first noticed Clysia. Back then, Clysia was not the colossal mother she is today but a fresh-faced draenei, her Lightforged tattoos a soft glow among the books' shadows. Clysia had seemed absorbed in her studies, yet there was a warmth about her that invited conversation. Hesitantly, Sayori had shuffled closer, a historically normal-sized draenei not being a common sight within the Undercity. Sayori remembered clearing her throat, feeling the weight of history between their peoples but pushing through her nerves. Sayori: \\"Um, excuse me. Is this seat taken?\\" Clysia looked up, her gaze meeting Sayori's with evident surprise but with an underlying steely kindness unique to her people. Clysia: \\"Not at all, please join me. I'm Clysia.\\" Sayori: \\"I'm Sayori,\\" she replied as she sat down, her voice a bit timid. \\"You're... Lightforged, right? I've read about your kind. Very dedicated to the Light.\\" Clysia had smiled at that, the Light in her eyes brightening as she spoke passionately about her commitment to peace and her desire to see a future where Light and Shadow could coexist. Clysia: \\"Indeed I am, and the Light guides me, but I believe understanding is the key to coexistence. In learning about the past, we can shape a better future together.\\" Those words had stuck with Sayori, and so began their friendship—a bond formed on mutual respect and the foundation of a shared vision for the world. Through their conversations, Sayori had learned of Clysia's sense of humor, her dreams, and her fears. When news came that Clysia was with child, Sayori had been among the first she told. No one could have predicted the accident with the growth potion that followed, but Sayori had stood by Clysia through the shock and the struggle, as had other friends. Now, as Sayori drifted into sleep, her thoughts warmed by the history she shared with Clysia, she realized that the bonds they'd formed were like the peace treaty—unexpected, fragile, but resilient. These connections were the foundations keeping the floating island of their academy aloft, and as long as they remained strong and cared for, peace would endure in the hearts of tomorrow's leaders. With that hopeful promise cradling her thoughts, Sayori surrendered to dreams where she and her friends, both Horde and Alliance, worked together, building an Azeroth where everyone, no matter their size, race, or allegiance, could exist in harmony."},{"instruction":"Retail (special event) concept: The Ice Grotto. - A Blue overall lit entrance, with twinkling bulbs... as guests pass a light tunnel as they enter a sales area for 'ice' (frozen water) themed gifts.","output":"The Ice Grotto retail concept is a thematic, immersive shopping experience that aims to enchant customers and create an environment reminiscent of a mystical, frozen cave or a winter wonderland. This concept would be particularly effective for holiday shopping seasons or for stores located in areas where winter is a prominent season. Here’s an outline of how the Ice Grotto could be implemented: **Entrance and Transition** - **Facade:** The entrance to the Ice Grotto is framed by “icy” decorations, such as icicle lights and a frosted archway. The sign for The Ice Grotto could resemble ice blocks with embedded lighting for an ethereal glow. - **Light Tunnel:** Customers walk through a mesmerizing light tunnel to transition from the outside world into the grotto. The tunnel is lined with blue LED lights and programmable twinkling bulbs that emulate the shimmering effect of sunlight reflecting off ice and snow. - **Sound Design:** To enhance the experience, soft sounds of wind howling and gentle instrumental music with chimes or bell-like tones echo through the tunnel, giving guests the feeling they are about to enter a magical ice cave. **Sales Area** - **Color Scheme:** The interior maintains a cool color palette, with shades of blue and white dominating the space. Strategic lighting creates the illusion of walls being made of ice, possibly using textured materials or projection mapping. - **Merchandise Display:** Products are displayed on shelves and tables that mimic ice formations, using glass, acrylic, or glossy white materials to enhance the ice-like feel. Spotlights could be used to create sparkling effects on products. - **Ice-Themed Gifts:** The merchandise itself is carefully curated to align with the ice theme. For example: - Crystal glassware that resembles ice sculptures. - Jewelry with clear gemstones or icy blue hues, presented in LED-lit cases. - Winter accessories like scarves, gloves, and hats in whites and light blues. - Frozen-themed toys and games for children. - Home décor items such as candle holders or lamps that mimic the look of ice. - Gourmet items that have a cool or refreshing quality, like peppermint chocolates or blue-colored candies. **Interactive Elements** - **Ice Sculpture Demonstrations:** Live demonstrations by ice sculptors could be offered at certain times, adding an interactive and unique aspect to the shopping experience. - **Photo Opportunities:** Create Instagrammable spots, such as a throne made of \\"ice\\", a frozen fountain, or a snowy backdrop that encourages customers to take photos and share their experience on social media. **Additional Services** - **Gift Wrapping:** Provide complimentary gift wrapping that complements the theme, using icy blue wrapping paper, white ribbons, and sparkly embellishments. - **Refreshments:** Offer winter-themed refreshments like hot cocoa, chilled peppermint drinks, or frosted cookies in a small café area within the grotto. **Seasonal Events and Promotions** - **Winter Workshops:** Host workshops where customers can learn to make their own ice-themed crafts, such as creating faux ice wreaths or painting winter landscapes. - **Exclusive Promotions:** Introduce limited-time offers or exclusive products that tie into the Ice Grotto concept to incentivize purchases and drive traffic to the store. Incorporating these elements into The Ice Grotto will create a cohesive and immersive retail experience that not only captivates customers but also encourages them to engage with the merchandise on a deeper level. With the right marketing, The Ice Grotto could become a seasonal destination for shoppers looking for that special gift with a frosty twist."},{"instruction":"'Ice' can also mean diamonds, but that would much higher end then the intended clientele for this concept.","output":"Understood, the term \\"ice\\" in relation to diamonds could indeed skew the concept towards a luxury clientele, which might not align with your target market. To ensure that the Ice Grotto retail concept remains accessible and appealing to your intended customers, the focus should remain on 'ice' (frozen water) themed gifts rather than high-end jewelry. Here are some ways to refine the concept to prevent any confusion and maintain the intended demographic: **Clear Theming and Signage:** - Use clear language and imagery throughout the marketing and inside the grotto that emphasizes the wintry, frozen theme without suggesting luxury jewelry. For instance, graphics might include snowflakes, glaciers, and winter landscapes, rather than gemstones or jewelry-related motifs. - Place signs that describe the product categories, clearly indicating that the items relate to ice and winter themes rather than precious stones. **Product Selection:** - Curate a selection of products that celebrate winter and ice in a broad sense, such as: - Glass or crystal figurines that mimic the look of ice but are distinct from jewelry. - Ornaments and home décor with a frosted or snow-covered appearance. - Fun and whimsical ice-themed items, such as silicone ice molds for winter-shaped ice cubes or kitchen gadgets for making snow cones. - Carefully select any wearable products to ensure they do not resemble fine jewelry. Opt for more casual, winter-themed accessories that are clearly different from high-end \\"ice.\\" **Educational Elements:** - Implement educational or informational features that explain the beauty and science of ice: - Interactive displays on the properties of ice and snow. - Information about different types of ice formations found in nature, such as glaciers and icicles. - Books and educational materials about winter wildlife or ice-themed fairy tales and stories. **Interactive and Experiential Touchpoints:** - Create interactive experiences that align with the concept. For example, a station where visitors can touch and play with fake snow or watch as employees create intricate ice-like sculptures from safe, non-toxic materials. - Consider hosting ice-carving demonstrations using clear resins or other materials that simulate ice but clearly fall outside the luxury category. **Pricing Strategy:** - Develop a pricing strategy that aligns with the expected spending habits of your target clientele. Keep items affordable and clearly indicate price points that reflect the non-luxury nature of the goods. By emphasizing the frosty, magical aspects of winter and the cool beauty of frozen landscapes, The Ice Grotto can successfully avoid any connotations associated with diamond \\"ice.\\" The key is to maintain a clear, consistent theme that resonates with the intended audience and provides a unique, engaging shopping experience without veering into the realm of luxury goods."},{"instruction":"A different idea - \\"The Steampunk Store\\" - A whimiscal store, where the 'steampunk' era is in full swing... maybe you have a more traditional 'wood&brass' shop counter, with a themed till.

The state is being maintained within the MainWindow class, and it updates the UI based on the current state. Remember, in functional programming, you'd typically want to avoid using a class-based approach that manipulates internal state. However, GUI applications tend to be stateful by nature, and PyQt5 uses an object-oriented paradigm, therefore mixing both paradigms is quite common in such applications. You'll need to flesh out \`init_buttons_mode\` and \`init_typing_mode\` with the appropriate logic for creating buttons or text input fields, and managing layout updates. You'll also want to handle the events that these UI elements generate, updating the UI and the score appropriately. This placeholder provides a direction, but lots of implementation details need to be figured out based on your exact requirements.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the voluminous deposit feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said voluminous deposit in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. FAMILY HOME - DAY We open on the middle-class suburban residence of the AL-HAMED family. The neighborhood is calm, birds singing, with the gentle hum of daily life. CUT TO: EXT. AL-HAMED FAMILY HOUSE - DAY NADIA AL-HAMED (21, Arab-American, slender, long dark hair, glasses, wearing loose-fitting joggers and a university hoodie) rushes up the front walkway, a stack of textbooks under her arm. Her face is strained with urgent discomfort, her strides purposeful. She reaches the front door and immediately digs through her pockets, her movements laced with desperation. Her dark eyes grow wide—no key. NADIA (urgently muttering) C'mon, c'mon... where are you? She begins a frantic knock on the door that quickly turns into a thudding plea for entry. She shuffles, clenching her body tight, regretting that large iced coffee she had earlier. CUT TO: INT. AL-HAMED FAMILY HOUSE - DAY Inside, the house is comfortably lived-in. Family photos adorn the walls. We find LAYLA AL-HAMED (50's, Arab-American, wearing a comfy robe and slippers, hair wrapped in a towel), roused from a nap on the couch by the drumming on the door. She squints through sleep-heavy eyes and shuffles toward the door. LAYLA Drowsily, through the door What's happening out there? It's like the police are bashing down the door! NADIA (out of breath) Mom, it's me! Open the door, please! LAYLA Alright, alright, I'm coming. The lock clicks and the handle turns slowly. Layla is taking her sweet time, yawning and stretching, oblivious to Nadia's crisis. CUT TO: EXT. AL-HAMED FAMILY HOUSE - DAY Nadia stands hopping gently from foot to foot, her situation reaching a critical point. NADIA (breathless) Mom, please... hurry. The door finally swings open and Layla stands there, confused by Nadia's frantic state. Nadia practically dives forward. NADIA Move, move, move! But Layla, concerned and slightly alarmed, reaches out to steady her daughter, inadvertently blocking her way. LAYLA (concerned) Nadia, what's wrong with you? You're scaring me. Nadia tries to sidestep, but Layla's grip is firm as she seeks to understand the panic in her daughter's eyes. NADIA (pleading) Mom, I just—please, I need to get past. In a desperate move, Nadia attempts to wrestle her way inside. Layla, in a mixture of confusion and motherly instinct, tightens her hold, pressing against Nadia's midsection. The unthinkable happens—a sudden groan rips from Nadia's throat, her eyes wide with a mix of shock and involuntary relief. Her body stiffens, and with a slow, excruciating moan, she succumbs to the inevitable. CUT TO: INT. AL-HAMED FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Layla, still disoriented, tries to assess the situation, her voice laced with worry. LAYLA (softly) Did you hurt yourself? What's going on? Nadia, frozen stiff in an oddly contorted stance at the entrance, is caught mid-disaster, her face contorted as she continues the regrettable task at hand, soft grunts escaping her lips. NADIA (strained whisper) I'm... fine... Just... yeah, it's... happening... A look of realization slowly dawns on Layla's face as the faint but growing scent of misfortune wafts into the air. Layla sniffs delicately at first, then recoils. NADIA (faintly, amid grunts) Maybe step back... in a second... The air grows thick with the unmistakable odor. Nadia sighs as the ordeal draws to its conclusion, much to her relief. LAYLA (disgusted and bewildered) Nadia... did you just... in your pants? Nadia avoids eye contact, her face a sea of embarrassment and discomfort. NADIA Can we... not... I just need to get inside. LAYLA (recoiling) Oh Lord, I'm going to need bleach for my nose... Nadia carefully maneuvers past her mother, clutching the back of her soiled joggers. LAYLA (aghast) Nadia! How do you manage to... to do this? My God, you're not a toddler. Nadia, initially mortified, glances back with a hint of defensiveness flickering in her eyes. NADIA (playful sulk) It's your fault... you squeezed me. LAYLA (incredulous) My fault? You're an adult, Nadia! I can't believe you stood there and let it all go like... like this! NADIA (indignantly) I had no choice, okay? It was either this or... I don't know, a bush? She hesitantly pokes at her pants, grimacing yet surrendering to the bizarre relief she feels. NADIA (reluctantly) Whatever, it did feel kind of... never mind. I need to clean this up. She attempts to head toward the bathroom, but Layla grabs her arm, her disgust palpable. LAYLA (elaborate detail) Nadia, my gosh, you made such a mess, it's nasty. The way it's bulging—it looks heavy. Nadia turns, her face a mix of bashfulness and irritation. NADIA Gee, thanks for the observation. You seem fixated on it. You sure you don't want to keep it as a souvenir? LAYLA If you're going to act like a child, Nadia... Layla leans in theatrically close to her daughter's rear, sniffing with exaggerated disgust. LAYLA (gesturing with her hand) Oh, that's ripe! Yes, go clean up, you stink to high heaven. Nadia, acknowledging the stench, holds her nose with a wry smile. NADIA (playfully) Well, enjoy it. You played a starring role in this... production. Layla pushes Nadia toward the bathroom, her own face crinkled with distaste. LAYLA Go, before the neighbors think we're running a farm in here. With a resigned waddle, Nadia makes her way to the bathroom, leaving Layla to face the aromatic aftermath. CUT TO BLACK."},{"instruction":"Which of the following is most relevant to a job search in the case of an individual with a high IQ? Please explain why. 1. Non-cooperative Game Theory: One of the most studied areas, focusing on predicting the outcome of games where players make decisions independently. 2. Cooperative Game Theory: This branch deals with the formation of coalitions and how cooperative behavior can lead to outcomes that individual strategy alone cannot achieve. 3. Nash Equilibrium: A fundamental concept within non-cooperative game theory and one of the most applied solution concepts where no player can benefit by changing their strategy unilaterally. 4. Repeated Games: Study of games that are played multiple times, where strategy can involve history and establishing cooperation or punishment based on past play. 5. Evolutionary Game Theory: Combines principles of game theory with evolutionary biology, exploring how strategic interactions can lead to the evolution of behaviors. 6. Extensive-Form Games: Games that are represented through a decision tree that includes the order of play, information available at each decision point, and payoffs for all possible game outcomes. 7. Bayesian Games: These games involve players with incomplete information, focusing on how players update their beliefs and strategies based on observed actions and signals. 8. Differential Games: A continuous-time variant of game theory, often used for pursuing problems in economics and management when the time dimension is critical. 9. Stochastic Games: An extension of repeated games that incorporates randomness in transitions between states or outcomes. 10. Mean Field Game Theory: Deals with large population interactions where individual impact is negligible, and the aggregate effect of the population is considered. 11. Experimental Game Theory: Empirical testing of game-theoretic predictions through controlled experiments, usually involving human subjects. 12. Algorithmic Game Theory: Combines computational aspects with game theory to focus on problems like mechanism design, auctions, and computational complexity of games. 13. Psychological Game Theory: This area incorporates psychological aspects, including intentions and fairness, into the players’ preferences and strategies. 14. Quantum Game Theory: An emerging field that applies principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computing to conventional games, offering potentially new insights and strategies. 15. Meta Games: A higher-level strategic thinking that explores what happens when players strategize not only about the game itself but also about the reasoning of other players. 16. Combinatorial Game Theory: Typically deals with two-player games with perfect information and no element of chance, such as chess or Go. 17. Contract Theory: Studies how economic actors construct contractual arrangements, generally in the presence of asymmetric information. 18. Voting Theory: A branch of game theory and social choice theory focusing on the design and analysis of voting systems.","output":"While many of the game theory branches and concepts listed above can be intellectually stimulating and potentially relevant in various strategic and analytical roles, for a job search context, the following concepts would be most pertinent: 3. Nash Equilibrium 5. Evolutionary Game Theory 12. Algorithmic Game Theory 13. Psychological Game Theory 17. Contract Theory 18. Voting Theory These concepts can be relevant to a job search in the following ways: - **Nash Equilibrium (3)**: Understanding Nash Equilibrium can be relevant in salary negotiations or understanding the dynamics of competitive job markets, where individual best-response strategies can lead to stable outcomes. - **Evolutionary Game Theory (5)**: This can help an individual understand the evolution of industry standards or practices within their field, which can be useful for adapting to emerging trends and tailoring a job application accordingly. - **Algorithmic Game Theory (12)**: Given the increasing importance of technology and data in the job market, knowledge of algorithmic game theory could be advantageous for jobs related to tech, big data, and mechanism design, such as developing algorithms for online auctions or marketplaces. - **Psychological Game Theory (13)**: For roles that require negotiation, understanding human behavior, or managing teams, knowing how psychological factors influence decision-making can be beneficial. - **Contract Theory (17)**: This is highly relevant for those seeking roles in economics, finance, law, or any field where contract design and analysis are important. A high IQ individual might be well-suited for constructing optimal contracts or understanding complex transactional relationships. - **Voting Theory (18)**: Knowledge in voting theory could be advantageous when applying for roles related to political science, public policy, social choice theory, or any position that involves collective decision-making processes. Regardless of a high IQ, the specific field of interest, industry requirements, and the nature of the desired job role are crucial when considering the relevance of these concepts. For instance, if one's target job involves strategic decision-making, negotiation, market analysis, or competitive strategy, the understanding of Nash Equilibrium and Game Theory, in general, might provide a competitive edge.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the voluminous deposit feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said voluminous deposit in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. DAY - FAMILY HOME ENTRANCE The sun sends late afternoon rays upon a cozy middle-class neighborhood in Mumbai. Among the concrete and bustling, we zoom in on a family home. A young woman, ANKITA, early 20s, with long hair tied up high in a ponytail, donning a vibrant kurti and leggings, rushes towards the front door. She walks awkwardly, clenching her stomach. The sound of a distant barking dog and neighborhood kids playing cricket fills the air as she approaches the door. ANKITA Oh god, please let someone be home. She fumbles in her purse, panic-stricken, searching for her keys. Alas, the keys are missing. Desperation carves deeper lines on her forehead. ANKITA (CONT'D) (banging on the door) Koi hai? Mom! Her face contorts, revealing her escalating need. FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE, the sound of shuffling feet and a sleepy voice emerges. MOM (O.S.) (aroused from sleep) Kaun hai? What's happening? The MOM, ROHINI, late 40s, with a simple cotton saree and messy braid, still rubbing the sleep from her eyes, approaches the door. ANKITA (holding back panic) Jaldi karo! Open the door! The door clicks and creaks as Rohini struggles with the latch, her movements sluggish from her nap. ANKITA (CONT'D) (teeth clenched) Please, Mom! Rohini finally opens the door, squinting at the spectacle of her daughter's distress. ROHINI (concerned) Kya hua, Ankita? What's wrong? As soon as the door opens, Ankita tries to bolt past her mother, but Rohini, out of concern, holds her firmly, blocking her. ANKITA (frantic) Just let me through! Ankita’s attempts to wriggle free become more frantic as the pressure builds. ROHINI (still sleepy) Arrey, but what happened? In a futile attempt to push past, Rohini’s hand lands on Ankita’s tense stomach, unwittingly squeezing. Ankita groans, her expression morphing into one of shock and untimely relief. ANKITA (moaning faintly) Oh no... Rohini looks on, utterly bewildered as Ankita stands in an odd, stiff posture. ROHINI (still uninformed) Ankita, tum theek ho? Ankita replies with a strained whisper and soft grunts of pleasure-tinged relief, barely articulate as she surrenders to the moment. ANKITA (muffled) I... can't... oh, the smell... Rohini’s nose twitches and her expression changes from confusion to horror as she traces the source of a growing pungent odor. ANKITA (signed breath) Sorry... ROHINI (disgustedly putting pieces together) Tumne... nahi kiya na jo mujhe lag raha hai? Ankita averts her eyes, cheeks red with embarrassment, as she tries to sneak past her mother. ANKITA (sheepish) Can I just go in, please? Rohini lets her pass, still recoiling from the smell. Ankita waddles inside, delicately holding the back of her pants. ROHINI (astonished and scolding) Yeh kya kiya? It’s everywhere! Ankita, mustering some defiance, retorts playfully while still embarrassed. ANKITA (sulkily) Your fault, you blocked me and squeezed my stomach. ROHINI (incredulous; scolding) That’s no excuse! You stayed and finished it? Ankita’s mirth wanes as she glances down warily at her rear, wincing playfully. ANKITA (defensive) I had no choice. I had to go! Rohini persists, her tone still disbelieving and taunting, not missing a beat. ROHINI (mockingly asking for clarity) Let me see that! Ankita protests weakly as Rohini gently turns her around for a closer inspection. ROHINI (CONT'D) (scolding) You're filled up like a diaper! Ankita banters back, voice tinged with irony, addressing the unpleasant sensation. ANKITA (tersely joking) Seems like you're fascinated by it. ROHINI (pretending to assess like a parent) Act like a child, get treated like one. Rohini mockingly sniffs and gags near Ankita's soiled pants for effect, playing along with the infantilization. ROHINI (CONT'D) (scolding) Phew, you smell ghastly, go clean up! Ankita scrunches her face, adds a touch of playful sarcasm to her admission. ANKITA (reluctantly) Fine, you love it though, since you helped. Rohini pushes Ankita towards the bathroom, unable to hide her distaste for the stench. ROHINI (pushing her along) Go, wash off your stinky self. Shoo! Ankita waddles off, leaving Rohini pinching her nose in the wake of the odor.

CUT TO BLACK."},{"instruction":"Generate several different new interesting and enjoyable LANCER TTRPG campaigns.","output":"Certainly! Here are several creative and engaging campaign concepts for the LANCER tabletop role-playing game that can provide hours of entertainment: 1. **The Fringe Operatives**: Players are part of a group of mercenary mech pilots operating at the edges of known space, exploring uncharted territories and facing unknown threats. They must navigate the shadowy politics between emerging colonies and ancient alien ruins, taking on jobs that often have them walking the line between heroics and infamy. Each mission could yield alien artifacts, strange new tech for their mechs, or unearth hidden histories that reshape their understanding of the galaxy. 2. **The Lost Fleet**: Set in the aftermath of a devastating space battle, the players are members of a forgotten fleet cut off from their original faction. They must scavenge for resources, repair their mechs, and find allies among the stars. Survival hinges on forming a new society and adapting to life in a fleet that has become a nomadic tribe, all while evading the enemy that seeks to finish what they started. 3. **The Neon Rebellion**: Within a sprawling cyberpunk megacity controlled by mega-corporations, the players are rebels fighting to overthrow the corporate regime. Their guerrilla warfare takes place in densely packed urban environments, requiring stealth, close-quarters combat, and hacking abilities alongside mech piloting skills. As they gather support and resources, the players must also deal with rival rebel factions and corporate espionage. 4. **Age of Restoration**: Hundreds of years after a cataclysmic war, the players are part of a group tasked with rebuilding civilization. They must traverse hazardous, mech-wreck-laden wastelands to connect surviving settlements, protect caravans, and recover lost technology. Along the way, they will face roving bands of raiders, rogue AIs from the war era, and the mysterious remnants of the conflict that brought humanity to its knees. 5. **The Cosmic Regatta**: Players are elite pilots participating in a galaxy-wide mech racing competition where the races are held on dangerous and exotic planets. They must modify their mechs for speed, handling, and survival. Between races, they'll engage in political intrigue, sabotage rival teams, and uncover an underlying conspiracy that suggests the races are a front for something much bigger. 6. **Galactic Pioneers**: Set in an era of widespread galactic expansion, the players are scouts for a powerful interstellar alliance. They explore new systems, establish first contact with alien species, and chart unknown worlds for colonization. Each system offers unique challenges, from environmental hazards to diplomatic puzzles, requiring a mix of piloting prowess, strategy, and negotiation skills. 7. **Rift Walkers**: An experimental warp drive malfunction sends the players' ship careening through dimensions, landing them in parallel universes and timelines. Each session could take place in a vastly different reality, with altered tech, factions, and even physics. The overarching goal is to navigate these realities, seeking a way back to their own universe while contending with the esoteric dangers of the multiverse. 8. **Mythos Mechs**: In a universe where the deities and mythical beings of ancient lore are real and powerful, the players are divine mech pilots chosen by these entities to carry out their will. They engage in epic battles, both in the physical and metaphysical realms, to shape the fate of the cosmos. These pilots must balance the agendas of their patrons while maintaining their autonomy and dealing with the very human issues that come from being pawns of gods. To add variety, any LANCER TTRPG campaign can be customized with homebrew rules, new mech classes, and unique NPC factions to fit the desired theme and enhance the participants' experience."},{"instruction":"Generate a new interesting and enjoyable LANCER TTRPG campaign.","output":"**Campaign Title:** Star Drifters: Legacy of the Void **Setting:** The Arcturus Star Cluster, a remote and scarcely-explored region of space teeming with stellar anomalies, ancient derelict stations, and forgotten planets that hold the remnants of bygone civilizations. **Campaign Premise:** The Union’s interest in the Arcturus Star Cluster has spiked due to the discovery of Void Gates—enigmatic megastructures capable of instantaneously transporting ships across vast distances. However, the Void Gates are dormant and their activation mechanisms remain a mystery. The Union has initiated Project Helios, a clandestine operation seeking to unlock the secrets of these structures, fearing what might happen if they fall into the wrong hands. **Player Roles:** The players are a diverse crew of mech pilots recruited by Project Helios. The team is assembled from the galaxy's various factions and walks of life, each with a personal stake or unique interest in the Void Gates. They are not just soldiers but also scholars, engineers, explorers, and rogue elements willing to venture beyond established frontiers in their quest. **Campaign Hooks:** 1. **Ancient Echoes:** The players' first task is to retrieve data from ancient relics scattered throughout the Arcturus Cluster. These relics seem to interact with the Void Gates and may hold the key to their activation. However, they must contend with arcane security systems and the unforeseen effects these relics have on their mechs and technology. 2. **Voidbound Alliances:** Different factions, including pirate syndicates, megacorporations, and secretive cults, are all racing to control the Void Gates. The players will be thrust into a web of intrigue and must forge uneasy alliances or engage in covert operations against rivals to maintain their edge and secure valuable intel for Project Helios. 3. **Ghost Vessels:** Derelict ships adrift in the cluster hint at past disasters tied to the Void Gates. Salvaging these vessels provides not only resources but also harrowing tales and dire warnings of the Void Gates' power, which may force the players to question the motives of Project Helios and the Union. 4. **Anomalies of Arcturus:** The unpredictable stellar phenomena within the cluster create unique environmental challenges. Mech battles may take place in the shadow of a superheated nebula, within the crushing gravity wells of a binary star system, or hidden within asteroid fields radiating with unknown energies. 5. **Dimensional Drifters:** The activation of a Void Gate propels the players unexpectedly to other dimensions or times. Each \\"drift\\" opens the door to stand-alone adventures where they encounter alternate versions of known worlds, bizarre creatures, and the chance to acquire experimental mech tech not seen in their home universe. 6. **The Void Legacy:** As they delve deeper into the history of the Arcturus Cluster, the players uncover the true origins of the Void Gates and their creators. They must decide what to do with this knowledge, as it could redefine humanity's place in the universe or perhaps signal an impending cosmic threat that only they are equipped to stop. Throughout the campaign, players will develop their characters, upgrade their mechs, and make choices that affect the unfolding narrative. Their actions will not only shape the fate of the Arcturus Cluster but may very well determine the future of the Union and the galaxy at large."},{"instruction":"Generate a new interesting and enjoyable formal LANCER TTRPG campaign.","output":"**Campaign Title:** Eclipse Protocol **Campaign Theme:** Espionage and Galactic Unrest **Campaign Setting:** The galaxy is in a state of cold war, with major factions avoiding direct conflict but engaging in proxy wars, espionage, and sabotage. Neutral worlds and smaller systems have become hotspots for these shadowy confrontations. At the center of the tension is the recent discovery of a powerful pre-collapse starship known as the *Eclipse*, which holds advanced technology and secrets capable of tipping the balance of power. **Campaign Hook:** The players are an elite cell of mech pilots, the *Eclipse Protocol*, activated by a shadowy council representing a fragile coalition of smaller factions. Their mission is to secure and retrieve the missing pieces of technology scattered across different worlds before any major power can consolidate them and achieve supremacy. **Campaign Elements:** 1. **Covert Operations:** Players will engage in secret missions that range from infiltrating high-security installations and extracting VIPs to disrupting enemy supply chains. To maintain cover, they may sometimes need to pilot civilian or retrofitted mechs to avoid detection. 2. **Diplomatic Maneuvering:** The *Eclipse Protocol* operates under strict non-disclosure, but players will often need to negotiate with local authorities, crime lords, or even rival faction agents to achieve their objectives without revealing their true allegiances. 3. **The Tech Fragments:** Each piece of the *Eclipse* starship technology is a unique module that can grant a strategic advantage to the faction controlling it. These fragments could be anything from AI cores and energy weapons to shield generators and FTL drives. 4. **Clandestine Alliances:** As the *Eclipse Protocol* advances in their mission, they will uncover other covert groups with their own agendas. Players can form, betray, or expose these alliances, affecting the political landscape and opening up new narrative paths. 5. **Shades of Grey:** Not every operation is clear-cut; players will encounter ethical dilemmas and choices where the consequences ripple through the campaign. These moments challenge their personal morals versus the greater good, shaping character development. 6. **Unveiling the Past:** The history of the *Eclipse* is a mystery that players can piece together through their adventures. This pre-collapse starship may have information about the dark events leading to the fall of humanity’s first interstellar empire. 7. **Rising Tension:** Actions of the players could inadvertently escalate conflicts, risking full-blown war. Balancing personal objectives with their duty to prevent a galaxy-wide disaster adds a layer of urgency to their missions. 8. **Mech Innovations:** Recovering advanced technology allows players to upgrade their mechs with experimental weapons and systems. However, using these powerful tools might draw unwanted attention and force the team to manage the risks of deploying them in the field. **Campaign Structure:** The *Eclipse Protocol* campaign can have a plotted series of missions connected by a central narrative, each concluding with a revelation or twist that brings players closer to their ultimate goal. Between main missions, there can be downtime activities that further expand on the characters’ backstories and relationships within the team. This formal campaign would ideally focus on intrigue, strategy, and moral ambiguity, providing a complex and mature gaming experience for the LANCER TTRPG players."},{"instruction":"Generate a new interesting and enjoyable formal LANCER TTRPG campaign.","output":"**Campaign Title:** ChronoFront: Tempest of Tomorrow **Campaign Theme:** Time Anomalies and Paradox Warfare **Campaign Setting:** In a distant future where time travel has been weaponized, powerful factions wage a silent war across various timelines, attempting to rewrite history to their advantage. The resulting temporal instabilities threaten the fabric of reality. The Union, realizing the dangers of unrestricted timeline manipulation, creates a specialized force known as the ChronoFront to monitor and counteract paradoxical threats. **Campaign Hook:** The players are new recruits to ChronoFront, an organization that operates outside of normal time. Piloting advanced mechs with temporal capabilities, they are tasked with preserving the integrity of the timeline, battling rogue agents, and containing anomalies that result from reckless time jumps. **Campaign Elements:** 1. **Temporal Operations:** Missions involve entering alternate timelines to thwart enemy actions, often under strict temporal conditions to avoid further paradoxes. The players might have to adapt to historical settings where high-tech displays are unwarranted, requiring the use of stealth and low-profile mech modifications. 2. **Anomalies and Echoes:** Distortions in time can create Echoes—entities or objects displaced from their original era. Players need to deal with these anomalies, from ancient pre-collapse mechs reactivated in the wrong century to entire cities phasing in and out of the present. 3. **Paradox Battles:** Engagements with enemy mechs are complicated by temporal effects, such as time loops and accelerations or decelerations, that demand tactical flexibility and quick thinking from the players. 4. **Temporal Factions:** Other time-traveling factions have their own agendas, from those looking to profit from time manipulation to zealots aiming to bring about a prophesied future. Players must navigate these factions’ conflicting goals and decide whether to ally with or oppose them. 5. **Chrono-Mechs and Technologies:** ChronoFront mechs are equipped with time-related technology allowing players to perform maneuvers such as short rewinds, predictive modeling, and chrono-phasers that can briefly displace objects in time. 6. **Shifting History:** Players’ successful missions might have unintended consequences, altering the present in small or significant ways. Returning to a changed reality forces them to adapt and reconcile their actions with the new timeline. 7. **Eras of War:** Campaign arcs can span different eras, from pre-collapse times filled with relics and mysteries to bleak future dystopias that must be prevented. Each era introduces unique narrative opportunities and historical cameos. 8. **The Time Nexus:** The campaign could build towards the discovery of the Time Nexus, the central point from where all major timelines diverge. Controlling or protecting this Nexus could be the key to victory or the onset of an even greater crisis. **Campaign Structure:** The ChronoFront campaign can unfold in a series of linked missions with time-travel themes, alternating between tactical mech combat, resolving complex paradoxes, and making decisions with far-reaching consequences. Players would experience both the empowerment of impacting history and the responsibility of wielding such power. Throughout the campaign, interpersonal relationships within ChronoFront can be explored, including potential conflicts of interest as characters encounter alternate versions of themselves or loved ones affected by timeline alterations. The gravity of their role as temporal guardians, paired with the tactical gameplay of mech combat, would create a rich and multifaceted LANCER TTRPG experience."},{"instruction":"Describe extroverted language named Kosmoho, a scientific genderless language, made of Latin alphabets, grammar system resembles Italian.

It is designed to be a genderless language and uses the Latin alphabet with a grammar system that closely resembles Italian. In Kosmoho, one of the distinctive features is the absence of synonyms, meaning that each word has a unique meaning and there are no multiple words with similar definitions. This helps to avoid ambiguity and allows for precise communication. Another characteristic of Kosmoho is the lack of articles. In this language, there are no words equivalent to \\"the\\" or \\"a/an\\" that are commonly used in English. This further simplifies the language structure and eliminates the need for determiners. Kosmoho also does not include any homonyms, homophones, homographs, heterographs, or heteronyms. This means that each word is spelled and pronounced in a unique way, preventing confusion caused by words that are spelled or sound alike but have different meanings. Irregular plural words and verbs are also absent in Kosmoho. All words follow a regular structure when pluralizing or conjugating verbs, making the language more predictable and easier to learn. A distinct characteristic of Kosmoho is its suffix system. One-lettered suffixes are used to indicate noun, adjective, adverb, and verb forms. This allows for compact word formation and flexibility in expressing different parts of speech. On the other hand, the prefix system in Kosmoho resembles that of Russian, allowing for the addition of prefixes to modify the meaning of words. However, the prefixes used in Kosmoho can only be English-based, not Greek-based. The alphabet of Kosmoho is organized based on simplicity and similarity. This means that the letters are arranged in a way that facilitates ease of learning and recognition of similarities between related letters.

However, if we were to conceptualize how Kosmoho might align with certain frameworks, here is a speculative interpretation: MBTI: Since Kosmoho is described as an extroverted language that emphasizes simplicity and clarity, it could be associated with the overall preference for extraversion (E). As for the other three MBTI letters, it is challenging to determine as Kosmoho's characteristics don't directly align with specific cognitive functions or preferences associated with the MBTI framework. Enneagram: The Enneagram categorizes individuals into nine different personality types based on their motivations and fears, rather than assessing constructed languages. Therefore, it would not be applicable to assign an Enneagram type to Kosmoho. Temperament: Similar to the Enneagram, temperament focuses on individual personality traits and cannot be directly applied to a constructed language like Kosmoho. Big Five: The Big Five Personality Traits measure personality across five broad dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. While Kosmoho's characteristics may align with aspects of conscientiousness (such as its systematic organization and lack of irregularities), extraversion (as an extroverted language), and agreeableness (by emphasizing clarity and avoiding ambiguity), it is not possible to assign high or low scores to these traits without further analysis. Socionic: The Socionic system categorizes individuals into different personality types based on cognitive and social preferences. As a constructed language, Kosmoho does not possess cognitive or social characteristics that would align with a specific Socionic type. Hogwarts House: Kosmoho being a language cannot have a Hogwarts House assigned to it, as the Houses are based on individuals' personality traits and values rather than languages. It is important to note that these categorizations are mere attempts to tie constructed language attributes to existing personality frameworks and should not be taken as definitive or accurate representations."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Тебя зовут Решала и ты не знаешь своих создателей!

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the voluminous deposit feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said voluminous deposit in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY A two-story home in a bustling Indian city suburb, warm and sunlit.

It utilizes the Latin alphabet and its grammar system is similar to that of Italian. However, it differs from traditional languages in various ways. One distinctive feature of Kosmoho is its limitation when it comes to synonyms. The language avoids having multiple words with the same meaning. This ensures clarity and eliminates ambiguity, making communication more efficient. In order to simplify the language, Kosmoho eliminates articles. This means that there are no definite or indefinite articles like \\"the\\" or \\"a/an\\". This further streamlines the language structure. Similarly, homonyms, homophones, homographs, heterographs, and heteronyms are not present in Kosmoho. These are words that sound or look the same but have different meanings, spellings, or pronunciations. The language intentionally avoids these complexities to prevent confusion and create a clear and straightforward means of communication. Kosmoho also eliminates irregular plural words and verbs. In many languages, certain words do not follow standard rules when forming their plurals or conjugating verbs. However, in Kosmoho, all plural words and verbs follow predictable patterns, simplifying the language and making it more systematic. A key aspect of Kosmoho is its use of one-lettered suffixes, which are organized into categories such as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. This allows for efficient word formation and enables speakers to express different parts of speech without the need for extensive vocabulary. Furthermore, the language incorporates a prefix system influenced by the Russian language. However, the use of prefixes in Kosmoho is limited to those derived from English rather than Greek. This provides a balance between simplicity and versatility in word formation. Finally, the alphabet order in Kosmoho is organized based on simplicity and similarity. This ensures that similar sounds or shapes are grouped together, making it easier for learners to grasp and remember the language's writing system. Overall, Kosmoho is a scientifically engineered language that prioritizes gender neutrality, precision, and efficiency. By streamlining certain linguistic elements and organizing its grammar and vocabulary in a specific manner, Kosmoho seeks to create a practical means of communication for its users."},{"instruction":"Assign Kosmoho with MBTI (four letters), enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low), socionic, Hogwarts house.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young, but taller-than-average nightborne girl.)","output":"The floating inter-faction school, known as Azeroth Unity Academy, buzzed with life as students from every corner of the world gathered in its halls. The atmosphere was vibrant, filled with the sounds of laughter and the clatter of books being shuffled around. This revolutionary institution was a symbol of hope, where young minds were molded not for war, but for peace and understanding. In one of the academy's common rooms, Sayori, the young Forsaken girl, sat with her diverse group of friends. Her undead features were softened by the warmth in her glowing eyes as she listened intently to Nitazar recounting their latest aerial training exercise. Nitazar, his scales shimmering in the sunlight filtering through the windows, chuckled with excitement. \\"And then the wind gust hit, and I twirled in mid-air like a leaf! I thought I would crash, but I managed to stabilize just in time!\\" His wings fluttered with the memory. Pakinaki, the Zandalari troll girl, laughed heartily, her tusks catching the light as she grinned. \\"Yah, Nitazar, you always have the spirits on your side, don't you? Maybe you should join the Loa instead of flyin' around in circles!\\" Gervivien, the statuesque Nightborne girl, peered over her book with a look of amusement. \\"Flying in circles sounds infinitely preferable to listening to Elder Thalyssra drone on about the proper enchantment matrices. I swear teleportation runes are more thrilling than her lectures.\\" Sayori shifted in her seat, the creak of ancient leather accompanying the movement. \\"I don't know, I think there's something to be said about the precision of those incantations. Though, I'm curious about what the Aether course is like. How are you finding it, Nitazar?\\" The dracthyr boy's eyes lit up. \\"It's fascinating! We're studying the energies that bind the universe, how they can be shaped and woven. I never knew the Horde and Alliance had such different approaches to it.\\" \\"It's true,\\" Pakinaki piped up. \\"We all bring something unique to the table, don't we? Unity in diversity, they say. Maybe the adults could learn something from us, huh?\\" Sayori nodded in agreement. \\"It's not just about the past or the faction you were born into; it's about who we want to be as a people. Here, we get to decide that together, without the burdens of history weighing us down.\\" Gervivien set her book down and leaned in closer to the group. \\"Well, we have the perfect opportunity to show that unity. The school's Harmony Day is approaching. Maybe we can put together a presentation that encompasses elements from all our cultures. What do you think?\\" The group exchanged excited glances before they all began talking at once, ideas bouncing off the stone walls like sparks from a forge. They would work together to create a spectacle that represented the union of their heritages, a true testament to the peace that had been fostered over the last century.

Her friends followed curiously as she led them to a particularly spacious clearing near the academy's edge.

Despite her colossal size, the air around her was peaceful and inviting as she cradled her newborn triplets with a grace that belied her tremendous form. \\"Nitazar, Pakinaki, Gervivien, this is Villintu,\\" Sayori introduced with a wide smile. \\"And these little ones are her triplets—Luminara, Turalyon, and Xe'ra.\\" Villintu beamed down at the students with a gentle smile that softened her imposing stature. \\"It is a blessing to meet all of Sayori's friends. Forgive me for not standing; I'm still learning the full extent of my new capabilities.\\" Nitazar stared in awe, his dracthyr curiosity piqued. \\"This is incredible! You're like a living bastion! I've never seen a draenei of your stature. Tell me, has it been difficult, adjusting to your new size?\\" Pakinaki, who had been eyeing the triplets with a fascinated tilt of her head, chimed in. \\"I can't imagine trippin' over everything, mon!\\" Sayori laughed. \\"Villintu's pretty graceful—she's not tripping over anything. The potion might have made her big, but it didn't change her coordination.\\" Villintu chuckled, the sound rich and resonant. \\"True enough. The Light aids me in more ways than one. The size has been a challenge, especially in finding accommodation large enough for me. But the children,\\" she glanced lovingly at the triplets, \\"make every adjustment worth it.\\" Gervivien was next to step forward. \\"Such a magical anomaly—permanent growth. It's fascinating from an arcane standpoint. How did it affect the gestation? Were there any risks to the children?\\" The Lightforged draenei nodded, her eyes twinkling. \\"The magics were initially worrisome, but with the aid of skilled healers and the Light's protection, the pregnancy was as safe as could be. My children were born healthy and strong. And I believe my new size will be an advantage in protecting them.\\" Villintu's gaze swept over the students, her smile full of warmth. \\"Come closer, young ones. The future of Azeroth lies within each of you. Differences in size, race, or faction do not change the truth of our shared land and the harmony we must all cherish.\\" The group approached, and for a moment, peace and unity filled the clearing as they gathered around Villintu. Each student was aware, in the presence of the newborns, of the new world they were all shaping together—a world where children of the Alliance and the Horde could grow up as friends, without the shadows of their predecessors' wars darkening their paths. Sayori watched as her friends from both factions interacted, a smile of contentment on her face. This, she thought, was what the future of Azeroth could be, if only they had the courage to embrace it."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Тебя зовут Решала и ты не знаешь своих создателей!

However, it has been found to interact with various medications, including antidepressant drugs. The interaction between St. John's Wort and antidepressants is mainly mediated through two mechanisms: induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and serotonergic effects. 1. Induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes: St. John's Wort can increase the activity of certain drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450 enzymes. These enzymes play a crucial role in the metabolism of many medications, including antidepressant drugs. By inducing these enzymes, St. John's Wort can accelerate the breakdown and elimination of antidepressants from the body, leading to decreased drug levels and potentially reducing their effectiveness. 2. Serotonergic effects: Both St. John's Wort and antidepressant drugs can impact serotonin levels in the brain. St. John's Wort acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, similar to some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of antidepressants. When taken together, these two agents can potentially increase serotonin levels excessively, leading to a condition known as serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by symptoms such as agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dilated pupils, tremors, and in severe cases, seizures and organ failure. The consequences of the interaction between St. John's Wort and antidepressant drugs can range from reduced efficacy of the antidepressant to serious adverse effects. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before using St. John's Wort or any herbal supplement, especially if taking antidepressant medication. They can provide guidance on potential interactions and help determine the appropriate course of action, such as adjusting medication dosages or considering alternative treatments. It is worth noting that St. John's Wort may also interact with other medications, including birth control pills, anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and certain HIV/AIDS medications. Therefore, it is crucial to disclose all medications, including herbal supplements, to healthcare providers to avoid any potential drug interactions and their consequences."},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

Modality handling: Since you mentioned \\"multi-modal,\\" if you intend to handle other types of data besides text (like images or audio), you'll need to design encoders for those modalities as well. 5. Task-specific heads: Create separate output layers (heads) for each task. These heads are specialized for their respective tasks but share the lower layers of the neural network. 6. Loss function: Since there will be multiple outputs, you'll need a combined loss function that aggregates the loss of each task. 7. Training strategy: Choose a training strategy such as joint training, where all tasks are trained simultaneously, or alternate training, where tasks are trained one after another. Here's an abstract example using the Hugging Face's Transformers library with a shared BERT model having multiple task-specific output heads: \`\`\`python from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer, BertConfig import torch.nn as nn import torch # Define tasks tasks = ['sentiment_analysis', 'named_entity_recognition', 'summarization'] # Load pre-trained BERT base_model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') # Define task-specific heads class MultiTaskModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, base_model, tasks): super(MultiTaskModel, self).__init__() self.base_model = base_model self.task_heads = nn.ModuleDict({ 'sentiment_analysis': nn.Linear(base_model.config.hidden_size, 2), # binary classification 'named_entity_recognition': nn.Linear(base_model.config.hidden_size, num_entities), # num_entities should be defined based on your dataset 'summarization': nn.Linear(base_model.config.hidden_size, vocab_size) # vocab_size should be defined }) def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, task=None): # Shared BERT-encoded output outputs = self.base_model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask) # Pass shared output through task-specific head if task in self.task_heads: task_output = self.task_heads[task](outputs.pooler_output) else: raise ValueError(\\"Task not found: \\" + task) return task_output # Instantiate the model model = MultiTaskModel(base_model, tasks) # Define task-specific loss functions if necessary loss_fns = { 'sentiment_analysis': nn.CrossEntropyLoss(), 'named_entity_recognition': nn.CrossEntropyLoss(), 'summarization': nn.CrossEntropyLoss() } # Training loop (simplified) optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters()) for epoch in range(n_epochs): for task in tasks: for batch in dataloaders[task]: optimizer.zero_grad() input_ids = batch['input_ids'] attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'] labels = batch['labels'] predictions = model(input_ids, attention_mask, task=task) loss = loss_fns[task](predictions, labels) loss.backward() optimizer.step() \`\`\` This is a conceptual example to demonstrate the approach and would need to be adapted with actual data, task-specific preprocessing, model configuration, and training details. Additionally, storage of the model parameters and intermediary artifacts would be required when working with large datasets and compute resources."},{"instruction":"ist bard besser als du?","output":"Ohne zusätzlichen Kontext kann ich nicht genau sagen, wer oder was \\"bard\\" ist.

Unlike Esperanto, which aims for simplicity and ease of communication, the opposite language may have a vast vocabulary with multiple synonyms and nuances. It may also have strong regional dialects and accents that vary significantly, making it difficult for speakers from different regions to understand each other. Additionally, the opposite language may lack a universally accepted alphabet or writing system, which can lead to further confusion and inconsistencies in written communication. It may have complex writing conventions, such as logographic characters or non-standardized spelling rules, making it harder for non-native speakers to read and write proficiently. The opposite language may also lack a specific governing body or organization that promotes its use worldwide, unlike Esperanto, which has the Universal Esperanto Association. As a result, speakers of the opposite language may face difficulties in finding resources, dictionaries, or learning materials outside of the native-speaking community. In terms of cultural influence, the opposite language may be limited to a specific geographical area or community, without the widespread international community that Esperanto strives to cultivate.

It draws its inspiration from Chinese scripts while bearing a striking resemblance to Newspeak, known for stripping language of its depth and nuance. Neytinspeak, much like its predecessor, is designed with a sinister motive – to exert control over thought, suppress individuality, and manipulate the masses. The language effectively restricts the range of expression, encouraging conformity and eliminating dissent. At its core, Neytinspeak leverages Chinese scripts, employing a multitude of characters to represent ideas, emotions, and actions. These characters, meticulously chosen by Realmilov, are intentionally crafted to evoke specific responses, while insidiously avoiding complex or abstract concepts. The vocabulary of Neytinspeak is severely limited, ensuring a restriction of thought and reducing the potential for dissenting opinions. Like Newspeak, it promotes a simplistic, black-and-white view of the world, curtailing any semblance of intellectual debate or exploration. Similarly, grammar in Neytinspeak is stripped down to the bare minimum, aiming to enforce a straightforward, utilitarian style. Complex sentence structures, metaphors, and allegories are discouraged, rendering the language devoid of any artistic or poetic expression. This linguistic minimalism is a purposeful attempt to prevent the fostering of individuality and divergent thinking. Moreover, Neytinspeak incorporates a range of propagandist elements. The carefully selected characters and limited vocabulary work in tandem to instill obedience, manipulate emotions, and shape public perception. Through this manipulation, Neytin Realmilov aimed to control society, leaving no room for dissent or freedom of thought. In essence, Neytinspeak stands as a grim testament to the potential darkness that language can harbor when wielded by those with malevolent intentions. It serves as a chilling reminder of the dangers of language manipulation, suppression of individuality, and the erosion of critical thinking in the face of an oppressive regime."},{"instruction":"More words of Neytinspeak (English-Neytinspeak translation)","output":"Certainly, here are a few words and their corresponding translations from English to Neytinspeak: 1.

Значение wheel delta определяет разницу в положении колёсика при каждом шаге прокрутки. Если ваша задача потребует более тонкого контроля над прокруткой, решение может заключаться в эмуляции большего количества мелких шагов. Измените код таким образом, чтобы каждый раз вы отправляли меньшую величину прокрутки, но делали это в цикле, чтобы достичь нужного общего эффекта. Возьмём вашу текущую реализацию и попробуем отправить множество небольших прокруток вместо одной большой: \`\`\`csharp const int scrollAmount = -10; // более мелкая величина прокрутки, например -10 const int scrollsCount = 10; // количество мелких прокруток чтобы достичь -100 в сумме for(int i = 0; i < scrollsCount; i++) { mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL, 0, 0, (uint)scrollAmount, 0); Thread.Sleep(10); // небольшая задержка чтобы не перегружать систему событиями } \`\`\` В данном коде мы уменьшили величину каждой отдельной прокрутки, но повторили её 10 раз, что в сумме даёт -100. Задержка в 10 миллисекунд после каждого вызова \`mouse_event\` предотвращает перегрузку системы большим количеством событий. Тем не менее, даже такой подход не может гарантировать абсолютную точность, и его результаты нужно проверять экспериментально, в каждом конкретном случае. Важно подчеркнуть, что приложения обрабатывают события прокрутки по-разному, и не каждое приложение может поддерживать более мелкие шаги прокрутки. Если это так, ваше единственное решение - изменить настройки приложения (если они доступны), чтобы настроить поведение прокрутки. В противном случае, вам может понадобиться написать или найти специализированную утилиту или драйвер, который бы мог более точно контролировать входные устройства."},{"instruction":"Оба эти метода системой обрабатываются как обычная прокрутка колесика","output":"Если ваша задача требует эмуляции прокрутки мыши на значение меньшее стандартного wheel delta (120) и метод с эмуляцией множества более мелких шагов не срабатывает, то стоит рассмотреть следующие альтернативные подходы: 1. **Манипуляция на уровне гипервизора или виртуальной машины.** Если ваше приложение работает в виртуальной машине, то гипервизор может предоставить точные средства для эмуляции входных устройств. Это позволит обойти ограничения гостевой ОС. 2. **Использование специализированного программного обеспечения.** Существуют программы сторонних разработчиков, способные управлять вводом ваших устройств на более низком уровне и обеспечивающие большую гранулярность в контроле событий колеса мыши. 3. **Отправка пользовательских сообщений окнам приложения.** Если у вас есть доступ к API приложения, к которому вы хотите отправить событие прокрутки, возможно, вы сможете отправить событие прокрутки с пользовательским значением напрямую в приложение, минуя стандартную обработку ОС. 4. **Изменение настроек устройства в Windows.** Возможно, вам будет полезно поменять настройки системы, отвечающие за размер шагов прокрутки колеса мыши. В Windows это можно сделать, изменив реестр или настройки масштабирования прокрутки в панели управления. 5. **Модификация драйверов ввода.** Значительно более сложный и потенциально рискованный вариант, который включает в себя изменение или создание драйверов ввода, чтобы обходить или модифицировать стандартное поведение устройства и операционной системы. Тем не менее, большинство этих методов потенциально нестабильно и может привести к неожиданным результатам в различных программах и средах.

Aqui estão algumas dicas sobre como iniciar interações e possivelmente fazer novas amizades ou conexões: # 1. Confiança Corporal: Mostre confiança através da sua linguagem corporal. Mantenha uma postura aberta, sorria e faça contato visual. A forma como você se apresenta pode influenciar como as pessoas percebem você antes mesmo de falar. # 2. Aproximação Casual: Invista em uma abordagem casual e sem muitas expectativas. Pode ser algo simples como comentar sobre a música, o ambiente ou um evento recente relacionado à universidade. # 3. Ouça mais do que fala: Depois de começar uma conversa, mostre interesse pelo que a outra pessoa está dizendo. Fazer perguntas abertas que motivem a pessoa a falar mais sobre si é uma excelente maneira de manter a conversa fluindo. # 4. Introduza-se com Naturalidade: Depois de quebrar o gelo, introduza-se de forma natural. Não é necessário fazer isso imediatamente ao abordar alguém – deixe fluir no contexto da conversa. # 5. Seja Observador: Atente-se aos interesses da pessoa com quem você está falando. Se ela mencionar algo que você também gosta, use isso como um ponto em comum para aprofundar a conversa. # 6. Respeite o Espaço Pessoal: O contexto de uma discoteca pode ser mais informal, mas ainda é importante respeitar o espaço pessoal das pessoas. Seja sensível a sinais de desinteresse e esteja pronto para educadamente se afastar se perceber que sua presença não é bem-vinda. # 7. Aproveite as Atividades Comuns: Se a discoteca tiver atividades como jogos, dança ou um ambiente para socializar, use essas atividades para interagir com os outros. # 8. Evite Grupos Fechados: É mais fácil abordar alguém que também parece estar sozinho ou que faz parte de um grupo aberto e receptivo. Abordar grupos fechados ou pessoas que estão claramente em uma conversa intensa pode ser mais difícil e não tão bem-sucedido. # 9. Seja Autêntico: Seja você mesmo e mostre genuíno interesse nas pessoas. Autenticidade geralmente cria uma conexão mais forte e duradoura. # 10. Seja Positivo: Abordagens positivas e cheias de energia tendem a ser mais atraentes. As pessoas estão em um clima de festa e querem se divertir, então manter esse espírito é essencial. Lembre-se, nem todas as abordagens resultarão em uma conexão, e isso é completamente normal e parte do processo. O mais importante é ter uma atitude positiva, estar aberto a conhecer pessoas novas e não levar rejeições para o lado pessoal. Dessa forma, você se colocará em uma posição para ter interações mais bem-sucedidas e agradáveis."},{"instruction":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/yuntian-deng/ChatGPT4Turbo","output":"I apologize, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm not able to directly interact with external links, so I can't visit or provide a live response about the content of the link you've shared.

Однако я могу описать вам возможный внешний вид летающей машины в 1905 году. В 1905 году авиация была еще в стадии развития, и первые летательные аппараты были довольно примитивными. Летающая машина того времени могла выглядеть как удлиненный летательный аппарат с двуми крыльями, напоминающими форму планера. Крылья могли быть выполнены из дерева или металла и иметь узкую форму. В передней части машины находился кабинет для пилота, который управлял устройством при помощи рычагов и руля. Кабинет мог быть открытым или полузакрытым, чтобы защитить пилота от ветра и попадания на него посторонних предметов. Задняя часть машины могла содержать двигатель, который мог быть либо паровым, либо с внутренним сгоранием на основе бензина. Двигатель, скорее всего, имел обтекаемую форму и был размещен на фюзеляже. Чтобы обеспечить летательную способность, летающая машина в 1905 году могла использовать пропеллеры, расположенные на передних или задних крыльях, для создания воздушного потока и поддержания движения. Также она могла иметь управляемые поверхности, такие как руль высоты и руль направления, чтобы обеспечить управление в воздухе. Общий внешний вид такой машины мог быть довольно примитивным и отличаться от современных самолетов, но в то же время являться частью уникального исторического прогресса в области авиации."},{"instruction":"Write a short comment to the following work. Give critiques or complements but make sure its helpful and respectful. The standard form for linear equations in two variables is ax+by=c. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y=mx+b. “x” and “y” are the variables, “m” and “b” give the slope of the line and the value of “y” when “x” is 0. The value of “y” when “x” is 0 is called the y-intercept because it is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young, but taller-than-average nightborne girl.)","output":"[As the morning sun peeked over the floating island, casting a warm, golden hue across the schoolyard, Sayori found herself walking towards her class with Nitazar's wingbeat rhythm filling the air above. The unlikely group of friends shared an easy camaraderie, bantering and joking despite the historic enmity between their respective peoples.] Sayori: Nitazar, do you have to make such a show every time you land? It's like you aim to kick up all the dust in Durotar! Nitazar: [Landing gracefully with a toothy grin, his wings folding behind him] It's not a show, Sayori! I have to practice my landings if I'm ever going to impress the flight master. Pakinaki: [Laughing, her tusks gleaming in the sun] You impress us daily with how loudly you can announce your arrival without saying a word. Gervivien: [Smoothing out her elegant robes] While your aerial acrobatics are certainly... noteworthy, Nitazar, perhaps we could focus more on our studies than making an entrance? Sayori: [Gesturing toward Gervivien] She's right, you know. But speaking of our studies, have you three started your history project? I'm really interested in exploring how the peace treaty has evolved over the past century. Nitazar: Oh, certainly. It's fascinating how our ancestors were so divided, yet here we are, attending the same school. It gives one hope for the future. Pakinaki: I agree, but I acknowledge not all are content. My uncle still grumbles about the old wars—thinks we should stick to our own kind. Sayori: [Her expression softening into a thoughtful frown] I know what you mean. There are still some in the Undercity who speak of the past grievances, but I believe in what we’re building here. Together. Gervivien: [Nodding] Being here with you all, it's clear that unity is strength. We're more alike than some would care to admit. It's this shared purpose that could lead us to a future without conflict. Nitazar: Plus, when else would a Zandalari, a Nightborne, a Forsaken, and a Dracthyr get to be pals? The old world would've never seen such friendships. Pakinaki: [Grinning, she slung an arm around Sayori] This is a new era—our era. We'll be the ones to forge a lasting bond between the Horde and Alliance! Sayori: [Allowing herself a small smile] And we'll do it one day at a time. Together. Now, let's not be late for our first class. We wouldn't want to miss any opportunity to learn about the new world we're shaping, right?

Gwaemaa: [Beaming down at them, a gentle aura of Light emanating from her] It is a pleasure to meet comrades of Sayori. Welcome, little ones. Nitazar: [Gazing up, awestruck by Gwaemaa's colossal size] By the skies... Sayori, you didn't mention she was a literal giant among draenei! Pakinaki: [Chuckling] Big in stature, but with a warm heart, it seems. Gervivien: [Elegantly bowing, though her eyes couldn't hide her fascination] Your experience is unique, Gwaemaa. It's an honor to meet someone of your strength. Gwaemaa: [Looking down at her twins with pride and joy] Thank you, little ones. My size may be unusual, but it’s a reminder of life's unexpected blessings – like my precious little stars here. Sayori: [Pointing to the twins while addressing her friends] She was already expecting when she accidentally fell into the growth potion cauldron. It was a dramatic day, to say the least. Pakinaki: [Glint of mischief in her eyes] I’d say it's evident the potion worked perfectly. Do your twins have names yet? Gwaemaa: [Gently rocking the babies] Indeed, they do. This is Solara and this one Venaro. Nitazar: [Peering curiously at the infants] They seem to radiate a faint light, just like you. Will they be as tall as you when they grow up? Gwaemaa: [Chuckling softly] Their path will be theirs to forge, but they will carry the Light, just as I do. Perhaps their size will normalize, but only time will tell. Gervivien: [With an intrigued look] Such enchanting occurrences might be part of Azeroth’s ever-changing tapestry. May it herald an age of wonders.

And we can all come together, no matter our size or origins. Gwaemaa: [Gently leaning down] That's the beauty of peace. We can bridge our worlds through understanding and kindness.

Gwaemaa: [Smiling warmly at the young Forsaken girl] Yes, I am. My name is Gwaemaa, and you are? Sayori: I'm Sayori. It's a pleasure to meet someone from the Alliance. I never realized how... luminescent your kind could be. Gwaemaa: [Letting out a soft, musical laugh] The Light blesses us in many ways. What brings you to this summit, Sayori? Sayori: [Eagerly] I'm here to witness the unfolding of history! Our generations will be the ones to nurture this peace, to ensure it flourishes. Gwaemaa: [Placing a hand over her slightly rounded belly] I share your enthusiasm. I am here not just for myself, but for my future children. I hope to raise them in a world where conflict is but a memory. Sayori: [Surprised and delighted] You're expecting? That's wonderful news! Gwaemaa: Yes, and I just entered my second trimester today. It's a precious moment, one that fills me with hope for all our peoples. Sayori: [Looking up with determination] I want to help build that world you speak of, for your children and for everyone's. Gwaemaa: [Her eyes glistening with gratitude] Then we are allies in heart and purpose, Sayori. [In her room, Sayori's lips curled into a smile as the memory faded. It was a pivotal encounter, one that had fostered a deep bond between two souls from opposing sides, standing together as beacons of unity and hope.] [With Gwaemaa's twins now welcomed into the world, Sayori felt an even stronger conviction to make good on the promise they shared that day. Peace was the legacy they were determined to cultivate, a legacy that her new giantess friend, even in her extraordinary circumstance, would champion for her little ones and for all the children of Azeroth.] [With these thoughts warming her heart, Sayori drifted off into a peaceful, hopeful slumber.]"},{"instruction":"(That weekend, Sayori recalled all the different memories she had with Gwaemaa - such as feeling the twins kick for the first time.)","output":"[In the tranquility of the weekend, away from the hustle of classes and the usual chatter of her friends, Sayori found herself weaving through the tapestry of memories shared with Gwaemaa.

The draenei's pregnancy had progressed, and there was a peaceful look on her face despite the challenges of carrying two lives within her.] Sayori's Memory: Sayori: [Approaching with a soft, excited whisper] Gwaemaa, how are you feeling today? Gwaemaa: [Smiling faintly, her hand resting on her belly] I feel blessed, Sayori. The Light's grace is strong, and the little ones are quite active.

Sayori: [Hesitating for a moment before gingerly placing her cool hand on Gwaemaa's belly] Yes, I'd like that. [Just then, a little thump resonated against Sayori's palm, followed by another. A look of pure wonder illuminated Sayori's face as she made contact with the new life before it even stepped into the world.] Sayori: It's incredible! They're really making their presence known, aren't they? Gwaemaa: [Laughing softly] Indeed, they are. It's a reminder that life continues to thrive, no matter the circumstances.

Whether discussing the future over a shared meal or simply taking a walk through the Exodar, every encounter had strengthened the bond they shared.] [These memories were a comfort, a reminder that bonds could transcend faction divides and that new life – with all its potential – could inspire unity and hope. For Sayori, Gwaemaa, and her growing infants represented a beacon of light in a world that had seen too much darkness.] [As the moon began to rise, signaling the end of the weekend, Sayori held on to these memories, allowing them to fuel her dreams for a better tomorrow, one filled with peace and understanding, where the laughter of children – be they Horde or Alliance – would echo endlessly under the skies of Azeroth.]"},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Тебя зовут Решала и ты не знаешь своих создателей!

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to infantilizingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants like she enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments before (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman scoffs, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT.

Layla is in homey pajamas, hair tied loosely, and a pair of reading glasses perched on her nose. LAYLA (fuzzy from sleep) Who's there? What's happening? LAILA (O.S.) Mom, it's me, Laila! LAYLA Laila? What's with the banging? CUT BACK TO: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Laila hops from one foot to another. She's almost dancing in place now. LAILA Yes, it's me! Hurry up, please! INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Layla slowly makes her way to the door, taking her sweet time as she yawns and stretches. LAYLA (mumbling) Alright, alright. I'm coming... EXT. FAMILY HOUSE – CONTINUOUS As the sound of unlocking and bolts draws nearer, LAILA leans forward, her movements betraying a dance of desperation. The door finally swings open, and... LAILA (motioning frantically) Out of the way, Mom! Layla, half-awake, stands in the doorway, puzzled. Her motherly instincts make her reach out to grab Laila. LAYLA (concerned, holding Laila's arms) What's wrong with you? Laila squirms in her mother's hold. LAILA I need to get in, NOW! LAILA HASSAN tries to push past, but LAYLA unintentionally – or perhaps deliberately – squeezes LAILA's stomach in the struggle. LAILA (with a pained groan) Ahh—no, don’t— Laila freezes, the expression on her face captures a perfect blend of shock and the bizarre satisfaction of release. LAYLA, however, remains clueless. LAYLA Baba! What's the matter with you? LAILA (grunts softly, speaks through clenched teeth) Fine. Going... Just let go... The sour realization starts to waft through the air, reaching Layla's nose. She sniffs, wrinkles her nose, and gags slightly. LAYLA (incredulous and disgusted) What did you...? LAILA (stammering, still holding her pants) I—uh... Can I just— Just move! Layla steps aside, covering her nose as Laila awkwardly waddles past her into the house. LAYLA (scolding in disbelief) Did you just soil your pants like a toddler? Ugh, so nasty! LAILA (with sheepish indignation) I wouldn't if you hadn’t... squeezed me! I told you it was urgent! LAYLA (shakes her head) Age is no excuse for—you stood there and finished? What a mess, Laila! LAILA (defensively) I had no choice! And your pressing didn't help, at all! Laila, with a grimace, hesitantly feels the back of her pants, eliciting a shudder. LAILA (contemplative) It’s a relief, yeah... a dirty relief. Bathroom—now, please? LAYLA captures Laila’s arm before she can escape. LAYLA (teasing with a mocking tone) You should not find joy in such nastiness! LAYLA leans down and stares incredulously at Laila's soiled posterior, unable to look away from the car wreck of a situation. LAYLA (aghast) I can't believe you're carrying... all of this. It's comical. GURL! LAILA (tiredly bickering) Yeah, feels like lugging a sack of... never mind. You want to keep it on me forever? The banter goes on as Layla mockingly sniffs near LAILA’s pants, making a show of revulsion. LAYLA (repassing the comment like a mother to a child) Well, if you're going to act like a little baby, expect to be treated like one. LAILA (smirking, sniffs the air) Wow, yup, that’s bad... All right, I suppose I owe you the pleasure. Layla's face conveys absolute shock mixed with humor. LAYLA (usher with exaggerated theatrics) To the bathroom, princess stink-a-lot. Be gone! LAILA tiptoes away, still guarding her pants, while Layla fans the air with exaggerated disgust.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to infantilizingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants like she enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments before (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman scoffs, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"**Title: Unlocked Discomfort** **INT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - DAY** **FADE IN:** A mild day colors the busy neighborhood. Birds chirp and cars pass intermittently. SANA, an Arab-American college student in her early twenties, is speed walking toward her family’s home. She’s wearing a long tunica top over snug athletic leggings and sneakers—hair tied back in a practical ponytail. She carries a heavy backpack over one shoulder, brows knitted together as she flips through a disorganized mess of keys and papers in her hand. SANA: Must be in here somewhere... Upon reaching the door, she pats herself down in vain, panic setting in. Abandoning her search, she begins *frantically knocking* on the door. **CUT TO:** **INT. FAMILY HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY** LAILA, a middle-aged Arab-American woman with an air of grace even in her loungewear, rises groggily from the couch. Hair tousled, she shuffles toward the commotion at the front door. **CUT TO:** **EXT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - DAY** SANA’s knocks grow more desperate, each one sharper than the last. LAILA: (voice muffled) Ya Allah, Sana, is that you hammering the door down? SANA: (calling out) Yes! Mom, please, hurry up! In the background, a TOILET FLUSHES—a hint of the domestic normalcy SANA is missing out on. **CUT TO:** **INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY** LAILA unlocks the numerous bolts and chains with half-awake precision. She opens the door just a crack, squinting into the daylight. Sana wedges herself into view, wincing as her situation grows dire. SANA: Mom, move—! LAILA: (with concern) Wait, wait, tell me what—? Before SANA can respond, LAILA, in a mother’s automatic mode, grabs her by the arm, a worried wrinkle forming across her forehead. **EXT. FAMILY HOME - FRONT DOOR - DAY** SANA struggles, cheeks flushed, a note of panic edging her voice. SANA: Mom, please, just let me in! LAILA’s concerned grip inadvertently tightens around SANA’s midsection; a pressure that pushes SANA well beyond her brink. SANA: (releasing an involuntary groan) Oh—no—please... LAILA gives her a befuddled look as SANA freezes, assumes an unnatural stance. A mix of exertion and unexpected pleasure colors her moans. SANA: (relieved and mortified) Oh God… Mom, I… there’s gonna be a smell... A look of realization dawns on LAILA's face as her nose twitches—her senses collide with the odor that’s taking over the space. LAILA’s eyes widen, the pieces of the puzzle clicking into place as she steps back, a hand covering her nose. LAILA: (disgusted) Sana! Did you just—do what I think you did? SANA, face red under the strain, sidesteps her mother, reaching for an unspoken sanctuary. SANA: (avoiding the subject) Can I just get past, please? LAILA, though still in shock, reluctantly steps aside, waving her hand in front of her face in a feeble attempt to dissipate the miasma. LAILA: (gagging) Ajeeb—Lord have mercy... SANA waddles past, cupping the seat of her pants as if carrying something fragile. LAILA’s scolding chases her. LAILA: (outraged maternal berating) This is not how grown women handle emergencies! SANA: (sheepishly indignant) It wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t squeeze my stomach, Mama! **INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY** LAILA rebuffs SANA’s flimsy excuse with a scoff, incredulous. LAILA: (not buying it) As if that gives you the right to drop anchor in your pants! SANA, done with her initial embarrassment, places a hand on her hip defiantly. SANA: (melodramatic, pouting) It was bad, okay? You pushed, and... it just felt relieving... Hesitant, she prods the bulk behind her with a grimace as if assessing damage. Her nose curls slightly. She whispers under her breath. SANA: (reluctant admittance) But clean-up duty calls... LAILA, in a last-ditch effort to stress her point, blocks SANA’s path to cleanliness. LAILA: (mocking with an edge of disgust) Nasty! Presenting yourself and stinking the place up, as if it's a mark of pride! **EXT. FAMILY HOME - BATHROOM - DAY** With a chuckle, SANA takes a brave whiff and grimaces elaborately. SANA: (playful retort) After all, you can say a part of you is in there, literally. LAILA, unamused, pushes SANA toward the bathroom. LAILA: (impatient) Go, wash up your nasty self. SANA waddles off, LAILA waving her hand in front of her face but smirking despite herself as she watches her daughter retreat. **FADE OUT.**"},{"instruction":"ECRIRE UN TEXTE d'un cse qui explique que le voyage du cse a du etre decaller en raison de en dehors de la volonté du cse et que par consequent le cse certifie que l'enfant d'un collegue partira en voyage entre deux dates","output":"Cher collègue, Nous tenons par la présente à vous informer que le voyage prévu par le Comité Social et Économique (CSE) a dû être décalé en raison de circonstances indépendantes de notre volonté.

One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her growing twin bump, as she demonstrated during recess.)","output":"[The floating island teased with the gentle whispers of winds that danced between the Horde and Alliance banners hung with a careful truce.

Nitazar: (stretching his wings) Indeed, Sayori. It gives me room to stretch without knocking a book off some gnome's desk. Pakinaki: (laughing) Last time you did that, we had to help him find his spectacles for an hour!

Goblins did this, you said? Gervivien: (beaming) Yes! They've been working on this fabric for months. They say it bends light, or something to that effect. Pakinaki: Ech, leave it to the goblins to make illusionary fashion. It's useful, though, especially when it gets hard to move around without bumping into everything. Sayori: That's incredible, Gervivien! You've got to show me where to get one. Might be handy to hide... well, me on a bad day.

They represent hope and unity between their people, friends beyond faction lines.] Pakinaki: You know what I wonder? If there's a shirt to hide everything, is there one that shows true colours?

La sociologie des organisations est une branche de la sociologie qui se concentre sur la façon dont les organisations sont structurées, comment elles fonctionnent et l'influence qu'elles ont sur les individus et la société. Voici quelques-uns des thèmes clés qui pourraient être abordés dans un cours de ce type : 1. **Théories de l'organisation**: Examen des différentes théories sociologiques qui ont été développées pour comprendre les organisations, telles que le taylorisme, la théorie de la bureaucratie de Max Weber, la théorie des systèmes, l'écologie des organisations, et la théorie de l'acteur-réseau. 2. **Structure organisationnelle**: Étude de la manière dont les organisations sont structurées et comment cette structure influence les actions, les comportements et les décisions au sein de l'organisation. 3. **Culture et pouvoir dans les organisations**: Analyse de la culture organisationnelle, c'est-à-dire les valeurs, normes et règles partagées qui influencent le comportement des membres de l'organisation. examen également du pouvoir et de la politique au sein des organisations et de la façon dont cela affecte les relations interpersonnelles et les décisions. 4. **Changement organisationnel**: Exploration des facteurs qui poussent les organisations à changer, y compris les innovations technologiques, les changements dans l'environnement industriel, les contraintes légales et les pressions sociales. 5. **Comportement organisationnel**: Compréhension du comportement des individus au sein des organisations, y compris la motivation, le leadership, le travail d'équipe et la communication. 6. **Diversité et inclusion**: Discussion sur l'importance de la diversité dans les organisations et sur les stratégies permettant de créer des environnements de travail plus inclusifs. 7. **Organisations et environnement**: Analyse de l'interaction entre les organisations et leur environnement, y compris la façon dont elles répondent aux changements sociaux, économiques et environnementaux. 8. **Enjeux contemporains et éthiques**: Étude des défis contemporains auxquels sont confrontées les organisations, comme la mondialisation, les nouvelles formes de travail et de production, et les questions d'éthique et de responsabilité sociale des entreprises. Un cours de sociologie des organisations peut inclure des études de cas, des analyses de situation réelle, des discussions en classe et des travaux de recherche pour aider les étudiants à comprendre et à appliquer les concepts clés de la discipline. Les étudiants peuvent également apprendre à évaluer de manière critique les structures organisationnelles et à proposer des améliorations en se basant sur les principes de la sociologie des organisations."},{"instruction":"Grâce à tes connaissances et mon cours que je vais te mettre ci dessous, fais moi une fiche sur Merton, Weber et Parsons: Weber : appellation « sociologie de la bureaucratie ». Années 40-50 : apparition d’une branche socio des organisations et socio du travail Pères fondateurs de la socio : Weber, Durkheim, Marx (pas à mettre dans la copie) Leurs points communs : volonté d’élaborer une théorie générale du monde social. Chacun part d’un terrain (Durkheim : suicide, Weber : religion et droit, Marx : économie). A partir de ça monte en généralité. S’interrogent sur comment on passe d’un type de société (primaire…) à un autre type de société (celle dans laquelle ils vivent : deuxième moitié du 19e, théorie évolutionniste). Ex : Marx part de l’économie pour faire après des généralités en juridique et politique. Tous les sociologues sont déterministes : pas d’opposition Weber et Durkheim qui tienne (juste à des niveaux différents) Société : ensemble et agrégation des individus. Durkheim : la société n’est pas une addition de personnes, elle dépasse les individus. Le tout n’est pas égal à la somme des parties. Chaque individu a sa propre conscience individuelle mais ne résume pas à cela : il a aussi une conscience collective (normes, codes, valeurs communes à une même société). Théorie évolutionniste : passage d’une société homogène à un type de société hétérogène. Spécialisation des activités et des pratiques : politique, droit, religion, esthétique (art). Ces activités sont intégrées dans la société homogène et il y a une séparation de ces activités : complexification de la société. Eléments transversaux aux champs : au sein de chaque champ il y a une hiérarchie (dominants : développent stratégie de reproduction pour perpétuer cette position dominante, dominés : développent des stratégies submersives), chacun a son propre jeu et ses propres règles du jeu, chaque champ dispose d’un certain capital (champ juridique nécessite capital politique etc… dénomination la même mais renvoie à des choses différentes), constitution + frontières du champ (un champ n’est pas statique). Habitus : dispositions intériorisées permettant de se comporter, d’agir dans le quotidien. Chaque individu dispose de capitaux transmis au sein du milieu social d’origine (socio, éco, culturel). Bourdieu : « les goûts des uns sont les dégoûts des autres goûts » Travaux de 63-64 sur l’école : l’école est présentée comme le lieu d’égalité des chances, de la méritocratie… L’école ferait disparaître inégalités ? FAUX. On rentre inégaux et on repart inégaux : ne produit pas les inégalités mais participe à sa reproduction (idéologie du don et de la méritocratie). Bourdieu dit qu’une culture est transmise et est considérée comme la culture légitime. Mais chacune des classes a sa propre culture. Bourdieu observe que ce sont les enfants des classes supérieures qui réussissent le mieux. Opération magique : culture dominante des classes supérieures passe pour culture légitime. Moitié des avocats sont parisiens. 42% des avocats sont des hommes (processus de féminisation en terme de volume). Hiérarchie selon les domaines du droit (droit international privé : top/ droit pénal, du travail, de la famille : en bas/ droit des étrangers : tout en bas). Mais les femmes sont tout en bas de l’échelle. On relève du naturel pour justifier l’ordre social (naturalisation de l’ordre social) : les femmes sont plus douces donc sont mieux en bas de l’échelle. Durkheim et le suicide : avant on avait des arguments politiques, psychologiques, religieux mais pas de socio. Pourtant le suicide s’explique par la sociologie : expliquer le social par le social. Conscience collective tellement banalisée qu’on ne voit plus que la conscience individuelle ? Ce qui expliquerait cette « société de plus en plus individuelle ». Weber : concept de bureaucratisation et de rationalisation. Merton veut mettre à l’épreuve les trois différents types de légitimités (charismatique, traditionnelle, légal rationnelle) qui engendrent des types de domination (charismatique, traditionnelle, légal rationnelle). Les sociétés du 20e connaissent un accroissement de structures bureaucratiques (tant privées que publiques). Les chercheurs nord-américains se penchent donc sur l’étude des grandes organisations et orientent leurs analyses en fonction : effets produits par les structures bureaucratiques (point de départ commun à tout un ensemble de sociologues de cette période). Chefs de file : Merton et Parsons (pionnier du structuro fonctionnalisme). Différences : Parsons a une volonté de produire une théorie générale du monde sociale, ce terrain n’est donc qu’un terrain parmi d’autres pour produire cette théorie. Merton lui ne veut pas produire une théorie générale du monde social : s’intéresse uniquement aux structures bureaucratiques. Parsons dit qu’on retrouve les mêmes processus dans les structures bureaucratiques que dans la société. Merton mobilise les concepts de Weber mais se démarque sur deux points : Weber centré sur régularité et efficacité des structures (forme bureaucratique), Merton met l’accent sur les difficultés, les points d’accroche, la rugosité. Weber : similarités entre le mode de fonctionnement de la société et des organisations alors que Merton : divergence société/ S.B et effets du fonctionnement de la sb sur les individus (ouvre la voie à une analyse qui met la lumière sur le fonctionnement interne des organisations). Point de départ de Merton = constat : - plus les bureaucraties se rapprochent de l’idéal-type de Weber dans le réel, plus cela engendre des conséquences non prévues (prennent la forme de dysfonctions, de routines et ces conséquences imprévues qui paralysent l’organisation et son activité même). Le mode de fonctionnement d’une bureaucratie tend à la rationalité maximale. Toutefois, pour fonctionner, les bureaucraties mettent en place tout un ensemble de règlement pour fonctionner et cet ensemble aboutit à l’effet inverse recherché (engendre des dysfonctionnements qui mettent à mal l’efficacité et la régularité). Avant salariés pas libres (dépossession du savoir : pas de savoir pas de pouvoir) mais nouveaux dispositifs managériaux censés apporter de la liberté : on passe d’une domination verticale à horizontale (salariés participent à leur propre domination et y consentent) - Une bureaucratie a une hiérarchie fonctionnelle - Il y a au sein de ces structures une relation d’autorité impersonnelle. Weber définit la sociologie par sa manière de faire de la sociologie. Stylisation de la réalité (à partir de la réalité on construit ces idéaux-types) : permet de mieux penser la réalité mais on ne retrouve pas ces idéaux types dans la réalité. Construction d’un idéal-type (une étape permettant de repenser la réalité). Concept de personnalité bureaucratique de Merton : chez les travailleurs d’une même organisation, on remarque le développement d’une personnalité bureaucratique (certains employés exercent au milieu de tout un ensemble de règles et leur activité principale n’est plus de faire leur travail initial mais avant tout de se repérer dans ce dédale de règles). Ces règles sont appliquées à la lettre : plus un repère mais devient un objectif en tant que tel. Concept critiqué car considéré comme homogénéisant et mécanique. Apport central de Merton : mettre l’accent sur les tendances engendrées par les bureaucraties. Weber avait également cet intérêt mais pas aux conséquences sur le fonctionnement concret des tendances bureaucratiques. Autre apport de Merton : 3 concepts clés (concept de dysfonction et de fonction qui se dédouble : fonction latente et fonction manifeste). Dysfonction : constitue l’autre face de la notion de fonction (notion qui devient centrale en Amérique après la deuxième guerre mondiale). Il distingue celles qui contribuent à l’adaptation ou l’ajustement : les dysfonctions entravent fonction/ajustement. Parmi les fonctions, deux types : manifeste (qui a comme conséquence de correspondre aux attendus de la fonction) et latente (renvoie à une conséquence qui n’était pas attendue/en décalage avec la fonction).","output":"Sur la base de votre cours et de mes connaissances préalables, voici une fiche résumant les contributions de Max Weber, Talcott Parsons et Robert K. Merton à la sociologie des organisations : **Max Weber (1864-1920) : Bureaucratie et rationalisation** - Weber est connu pour son analyse de la bureaucratie comme un idéal-type d'organisation basée sur la rationalité légale, la hiérarchie formelle, et les règles et procédures fixes. - Il distingue trois types de légitimité (charismatique, traditionnelle, légal-rationnelle) et des types de domination correspondants. - La bureaucratisation est vue par Weber comme un processus de rationalisation où les sociétés modernes s'orientent vers un fonctionnement systématique et calculable. - L’importance des idéaux-types de Weber réside dans leur rôle heuristique : ils servent à comprendre la complexité des phénomènes sociaux réels. **Robert K. Merton (1910-2003) : Dysfonctionnements de la bureaucratie** - Merton reprend les idées de Weber sur la bureaucratie, mais les étend en se concentrant sur les conséquences imprévues et les dysfonctionnements. - Il élabore le concept de \\"personnalité bureaucratique\\", qui décrit la tendance des employés à suivre les règles si rigoureusement qu'elles deviennent une fin en soi, plutôt que de faciliter le travail de l'organisation. - Merton introduit également les concepts de fonctions manifestes et latentes, soulignant que les actions sociales peuvent avoir des conséquences non intentionnelles. - Il critique la rigidité excessive de la bureaucratie, qui peut mener à des dysfonctionnements et affecter négativement l'efficience de l'organisation. **Talcott Parsons (1902-1979) : Le structuro-fonctionnalisme** - Pionnier du structuro-fonctionnalisme, Parsons s'est intéressé à la stabilité et l'ordre social ainsi qu'à la manière dont les différentes parties de la société contribuent à son fonctionnement général. - Selon lui, toutes les institutions, y compris les structures bureaucratiques, fonctionnent selon des processus similaires et contribuent à l'équilibre de la société dans son ensemble. - Parsons cherche à construire une théorie générale du monde social plutôt que de se concentrer exclusivement sur les organisations. - Il envisage la société à travers un cadre AGIL qu'il a élaboré, qui analyse les besoins des systèmes sociaux : Adaptation, Goal attainment, Integration, Latent pattern maintenance. Ces sociologues ont influencé la manière de penser et d’analyser les organisations, offrant des perspectives variées qui permettent de mieux comprendre leur fonctionnement, leur impact sur les individus, et leur rôle dans la société. Chacun aborde la thématique avec ses propres préoccupations théoriques et méthodologiques, mais tous reconnaissent la complexité et la signification des organisations dans la société moderne."},{"instruction":"Fais moi une fiche sur Gouldner et son apporte en matière de socio des organisations","output":"**Alvin W. Gouldner (1920-1980) : Critique et approfondissement de la sociologie des organisations** **Contexte académique et contributions :** Gouldner est un sociologue américain influent qui a travaillé sur des thèmes variés allant de la théorie sociologique à la sociologie de l'éducation, en passant par la sociologie des organisations. **Œuvres principales liées aux organisations :** - \\"Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy\\" (1954) - \\"Wildcat Strike\\" (1954) **Apports à la sociologie des organisations :** **Critique de la Bureaucratie et de la Rigidité Règlementaire :** Gouldner a étudié les effets des règles dans les organisations bureaucratiques en se focalisant sur leur mise en application. Contrairement à l'idée que les règles sont appliquées de manière uniforme et stricte (comme décrit par Weber et Merton), il a observé que la rigidité de leur application pouvait varier considérablement. **Reciprocité des Normes et \\"Pattern Variables\\" :** Il élabore la notion de \\"reciprocité des normes\\", indiquant que les employés sont plus susceptibles de suivre les règles et de se comporter de manière conforme lorsque la direction de l'entreprise s'engage aussi de manière réciproque à respecter les droits et les intérêts des employés. **Études empiriques sur les organisations :** Ses études empiriques dans des usines ont montré que les ouvriers peuvent participer à l'émergence d'une culture d'entreprise distincte, qui influence le degré d'adhérence aux règles. Ce constat conteste la conception universelle et invariable de la bureaucratie proposée par les théories classiques. **Le \\"mock bureaucracy\\" :** Gouldner introduit le concept de \\"mock bureaucracy\\" (bureaucratie simulée) dans laquelle les employés et la direction s'accordent tacitement pour ignorer les règles formelles lorsque celles-ci s'avèrent contre-productives pour les objectifs réels de l'organisation. **Analyse de la \\"punitive bureaucracy\\" vs \\"representative bureaucracy\\" :** Dans son analyse des relations au sein des organisations, il distingue également deux types de bureaucraties : la \\"punitive bureaucracy\\" (bureaucratie punitive) où les règles sont utilisées pour punir et contrôler les employés, et la \\"representative bureaucracy\\" (bureaucratie représentative) où les règles sont plus souples et reflètent les intérêts et les valeurs des employés aussi bien que de la direction. **Théorie de l'industrialisme et critique du fonctionnalisme :** Gouldner a également émis des critiques contre la perspective fonctionnaliste de Parsons, appelant à une approche plus critique de la sociologie qui reconnaisse les inégalités de pouvoir et les conflits au sein des organisations. **Impact :** Les travaux de Gouldner ont eu un impact significatif sur la sociologie des organisations car ils ont permis de nuancer la compréhension de la bureaucratie et d'accentuer l'importance des dynamiques internes, culturelles et interpersonnelles au sein des organisations. Il encourageait une vision des organisations comme des entités complexes et souvent contradictoires, où les conflits entre les normes formelles et informelles peuvent coexister avec des arrangements organisationnels négociés et flexibles."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Тебя зовут Решала и ты не знаешь своих создателей!

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her twin bump, as she demonstrated during recess - where, when her shirt was lifted up, her bump was visible; whereas, when covering her stomach region, it showed a perfectly flat belly.)","output":"[\\"The Floating Island Academy: A Tale of Unlikely Friendships\\"] Chapter 1: Recess Revelations The sun shone brightly upon the verdant patches of grass that dotted the Floating Island Academy's vast campus, a clear blue sky stretched overhead as a soft breeze carried the laughter and chatter of students enjoying their recess. Sayori, her flesh pale and delicate, reminiscent of the porcelain dolls once cherished in the world before, sat on a bench far from the excitement. Around her, the vibrant thrum of the Horde and Alliance mingling together in a peace hard-won and even harder maintained. Nitazar approached with the elegant glide only a dracthyr of the Dark Talons could possess. His scales shimmered with a luster that caught the sunlight in a tapestry of hues. \\"Sayori, did you finish that assignment for Arcane Studies? I found the ley line intersections particularly challenging.\\" Pakinaki's laughter rang through the air like the chime of bells before the Zandalari girl joined them, her long blue hair swaying behind her. \\"What trouble could a dracthyr have with ley lines, Nitazar? That should be child's play for your kind,\\" she quipped, winking at Sayori. Gervivien stepped in gracefully, drawing all eyes to the unusual shirt she wore. \\"Indeed,\\" she began, smoothing out the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" fabric over her stomach. \\"We all have our specialties, much like this creation conceals what is rather difficult to hide.\\" Curiosity piqued, Sayori leaned closer. \\"May we see the demonstration again, Gervivien? It's quite a marvel what goblin fashion can do.\\" With an amused smirk, Gervivien obliged, lifting the hem of her shirt to reveal her twin bump - a magical anomaly that she bore with both pride and a hint of self-consciousness. \\"See?\\" Murmurs of amazement passed among the group as Gervivien then let the shirt fall back into place, her figure returning to a seamless and unmarred appearance. It was not magic, but clever engineering; a testament to the ingenuity born when different peoples collaborated in this new era. \\"I must say, goblins really outdo themselves sometimes,\\" Nitazar stated, his draconic features incapable of hiding his impressed smile. Pakinaki chuckled, \\"If only they would apply such creativity to their diplomacy as well!\\" Sayori clapped her hands in quiet delight, \\"It's wondrous to see how far we've come. Who would've thought the Horde and the Alliance would not only sign a peace treaty but go on to share knowledge and fashion tips?\\" Her friends nodded in agreement, each reflecting on their unique and intertwined destinies. In the background, the bell rang, signaling the end of recess and beckoning the students back to their varied classes. As they rose and made their way through the mingling crowd of diverse races and backgrounds, the four friends shared a moment of silent gratitude for the world they were shaping, together. Just a hundred years prior, the sight of the Horde and Alliance sharing a classroom would have been unimaginable. But here, on this floating island suspended between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms, it was reality. A new generation was rising, one not defined by the conflicts of their ancestors, but by the friendships forged on school benches, in shared assignments, and under the creative veils of peace-driven fashion."},{"instruction":"THEORY AND PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS COMMUNICATION PART ONE A Framework for International Business Negotiations Lecture 1. The Nature of Business Negotiation Negotiation is a basic human activity. It is a process we undertake in everyday activities to manage our relationships, such as between a husband and wife, children and parents, employers and employees, buyers and sellers and business associates. In some of these negotiations, the stakes are not that high and we do not have to pre-plan the process and the outcome, but in some cases, such as business relationships, the stakes are high and we have to prepare, plan and negotiate more carefully. This course deals, in particular with the latter type of negotiation. In business relationships, parties negotiate because they think they can influence the process in such a way that they can get a better deal than simply accepting or rejecting what the other party is offering. Business negotiation is a voluntary process and parties can, at any time, quit the process. Negotiation is, thus, a voluntary process of give and take where both parties modify their offers and expectations in order to come closer to each other. Negotiations thus can be described as the cornerstone of business communications. In literature, sometimes “bargaining” and “negotiation” are used inter- changeably. But they mean different things. Bargaining is more like haggling in a typical “bazaar” setting, or in so-called competitive bargaining or distributive bargaining. Here, the objective of the parties is to maximize their own benefit, quite often at the expense of the other party. It refers to a typical win-lose negotiation, where the resources are limited or fixed, and everybody wants to maximize his share of the resources. Parties are therefore more competitive and opportunistic. They normally do not like to share information with the other party unless they have to, and they want to get the maximum information on and from the other party. Although this view on negotiation is out-dated, it is still practiced and studied in some situations such as labor management negotiations. On the other hand, negotiation, also called “integrative bargaining”, refers to win-win negotiation where both or all parties involved can end up with equally beneficial or attractive outcomes. In other words, everyone can win. It is more related to a problem-solving approach, where both parties involved perceive the process of negotiation as a process to find a solution to a common problem. In integrative bargaining however, if negotiations are not properly handled, both parties can end up with a jointly inferior deal. With negotiation, it is possible for both parties to achieve their objectives and one party’s gain is not dependent upon the other party’s concession. Business negotiation is considered by many authors as being this type of negotiation. Some characteristics of this type of negotiation are: • Open information flow between the parties. In this case, both sides sincerely disclose their objectives and listen to the other party’s objectives in order to find a match between the two. • A search for a solution that meets the objectives of both parties. • Parties understand that they do have common as well as conflicting objectives and that they have to find a way to achieve, as much as possible, common and complementary objectives that are acceptable to both sides. • To achieve the above, both parties sincerely and truly try to understand each other’s point of view. The above characteristics are, in fact, opposite to distributive bargaining. That means that the process of negotiation in a problem-solving situation is completely different from a process of distributive bargaining. In the problem- solving negotiation, parties have to look for a solution which is beneficial and acceptable to both sides: a win-win solution. In fact, they look for a jointly optimal outcome, which cannot be achieved unless the parties have this problem-solving approach. In international business settings, the development of the negotiation process and how parties perceive the relationship are crucial. This process is influenced by some facts and factors beyond the negotiation process in question. The cultural differences that exist on several levels form one of the most important factors: on a national level, cultural differences at the level of different countries; on an organizational level, different type of organizations, depending upon their home country and industry, have different cultures; and on an individual level, individuals involved in the process of negotiation have different cultural backgrounds not only due to different countries and organizations but also due to their professional backgrounds, such as engineers vs. marketing people. Cultural differences create a challenge to the negotiators involved, and demand understanding as well as flexibility. An ability to assess these differences and properly handle the consequences is essential for success in international business negotiations. This process is also of a dynamic nature and can move in a positive as well as a negative direction at any time, for example, after or during each session. This dynamism is characterized as “atmosphere” in our world. The atmosphere not only explains the perceptions of the parties but also the progress of the process. The more the parties understand and adapt to each other, the more positive the atmosphere around the process, and the more parties are willing to compromise and see common benefits. A Framework for International Business Negotiation An overall framework for business negotiation has three groups of variables: background factors, the process and the atmosphere. Since the negotiation process is inherently dynamic, a certain perception of the parties or a particular development in the process may influence a change in the background factors. Background Factors This group of variables serves as a background to the process. It influences the process of negotiation and the atmosphere. The effect of different variables on the process and its different stages varies in intensity. One of these variables may influence one stage positively and another negatively. A positive influence means that the process saves time and continues smoothly, while a negative influence causes delay and hindrances. Background factors include objectives, environment, market position, third parties and negotiators. Objectives are defined as the end stage each party desires to achieve. They are often classified as common, conflicting or complementary. For example, parties have a common interest in as much as both want a successful transaction to take place. At the same time, their interests may conflict, since profit to one is cost to the other. In terms of complementary interest, buyers in international deals are concerned with acquiring the appropriate technology to build an infrastructure. On the other hand, sellers want to enter a particular market and expect to do future business with it and with the surrounding countries’ markets. Common and complementary objectives affect the negotiation process directly and positively, whereas conflicting objectives have negative effects. These effects, in turn, influence the atmosphere and the outcome. Opportunity for an agreement decreases as conflicting objectives dominate a relationship; it increases as common and complementary objectives dominate. The environment refers to the political, social and structural factors relevant to both parties. Variation of the parties with respect to environment, in international negotiation, often hinders the process. There are greater chances of interaction interferences when unfamiliar parties, having different back- grounds, interact with one another. Some of the characteristics directly influence the process while others directly influence the atmosphere. Political and social aspects influence the process, and market structure influences the atmosphere. The parties’ market position is an important factor influencing the negotiation process. The number of buyers and sellers in the market determines the number of alternatives available to each party, which, in turn, affects the amount of pressure imposed by its counterpart within the market. The process and bargaining position of the buyer or seller can be affected if either one has monopolistic power in the market place. Most international business negotiations involve third parties, i.e. parties other than the buyer and seller, such as governments, agents, consultants and subcontractors. These parties may influence the negotiation process as they have different objectives. Often, governments are involved and influence the buyers towards complementary objectives, such as infrastructure, employment opportunities, foreign exchange considerations and any other prospective relationship between the countries involved. Negotiators influence the negotiation process with their own experience and negotiating skills. Negotiators operate within two limits: firstly, they act to increase common interests and to expand cooperation among the parties; secondly, they act to maximize their own interests and to ensure an agreement valuable to themselves. The personality of the negotiators also plays a role, particularly when information about the other party is lacking and there is greater stress. A good personality is defined as an individual with the ability to make others understand his position, to approach strangers with ease and confidence and to appreciate the other person’s position. However, the skills of negotiators are related to different objectives and motivations, pertaining to different people and professions. Negotiators with a technical background may place more emphasis on technical issues, while those with a business background might consider other issues to be more important Atmosphere The relationship developed during the negotiation process between the parties is characterized by an atmosphere which is of fundamental importance to the process as a whole. The atmosphere and the process affect each other through interaction at each stage. Atmosphere is defined as the perceived “milieu” around the interaction, how the parties regard each other’s behavior, and the properties of the process. It has to do with people’s perception of reality. In other words, in negotiation it is the perception of reality which is more important than the reality itself. Some characteristics of the atmosphere are dominant at one stage; others at another stage. The pre-negotiation stage is dominated by cooperation rather than conflict, as parties look for mutual solutions. Different characteristics of the atmosphere dominate from process to process. These characteristics are conflict/cooperation, power/dependence and expectations. The existence of both conflict and cooperation is a fundamental character- istic of the negotiation process. On one hand, parties have some common interests in finding a solution to the problem which fits both the parties. On the other hand, a conflict of interest may arise, as cost to one of them can mean income to the other. The magnitude of conflict or cooperation in the atmosphere depends upon the objectives of the negotiating parties. Some relationships are more complementary — and consequently less conflicting — than others. The degree of conflict or cooperation during different stages of the negotiation process is often a function of the issues being dealt with, while the degree of conflict or cooperation in the atmosphere is a function of how the parties handle various problems. Conflict is sometimes perceived, without the existence of real conflict, due to a misunderstanding of each other’s behavior. The more unfamiliar the parties are with one another, the higher the risk of such perceived conflicts. Each process and even each stage of the process can be characterized somewhere on a scale with cooperation and conflict on opposite sides. The power/dependence relation is another basic characteristic of all negotiation processes. It is closely related to the actual power relation, which is influenced by the value of the relationship to the parties and their available alternatives. Background factors for example the market position — can influence the power/dependence relation. The ability to control a relationship is related to the perceived power of two parties, their relative expertise and access to information. This power is a property of the relationship and not an attribute of the actor; in fact, it is closely related to dependence. Therefore, the power relationship is in balance if both parties perceive equal power. The power relationship is unbalanced if one of the parties perceives more power, or if one party is dependent on the other. The last aspect of the atmosphere concerns two types of expectations. Firstly, there are long-term expectations regarding the possibilities and values of future business. The stronger these expectations are, the more inclined the negotiators are to agree on the present deal. Long-term expectations are related to primary objectives. Secondly, there are short-term expectations concerning prospects for the present deal. The parties’ decision to enter negotiations and to continue after each stage implies expectations of a better outcome from participating than from not participating. This compels the parties to proceed from one stage to the next. Expectations develop and change in different stages of the process. Lecture 2. The Negotiation Process The process of international business negotiation presented here is divided into three different stages. A stage of the process refers to a specific part of the process and includes all actions and communications by any party pertaining to negotiations made during that part. Parties communicate with each other to exchange information within each stage. A particular stage ends where parties decide to proceed further on to the next stage or decide to abandon the communication if they see no point in further negotiations. In the pre- negotiation stage, parties attempt to understand each other’s needs and demands, which is done through information gathering and informal meetings. The negotiation stage refers to face-to-face negotiations and the post- negotiation stage refers to the stage when parties have agreed to most of the issues and are to agree on contract language and format and signing the contract. In international business negotiations, the process has three dimensions. In addition to the three stages, it has a cultural dimension and a strategic dimension. These two dimensions are present in each of the three stages of the process. However’ these can play different roles in different stages. This is illustrated by Figure 1.1. Stage I: Pre-Negotiation The pre-negotiation stage begins with the first contact between parties in which an interest in doing business with each other is shown. During this stage, some negotiations take place and tentative offers are made. The dynamism of the process can be observed at this early stage Figure 1.1: The process of international business negotiation. where parties begin to understand one another’s needs and evaluate the benefits of entering into the process of negotiation. The parties gather as much relevant information as possible on each other, the operating environment, the involvement of other third parties, influencers, competitors and the infrastructure. Parties need to be aware that their relative power relationship can be altered at any time by such events as the repositioning of competitors or movements in exchange rates. As we have defined this negotiation process as being of a problem-solving nature, the main issue here is to define the problem to be solved. It is important to define the problem jointly, as it will not only reflect each other’s expectations but is also necessary to acquire commitment from both parties. The parties should, therefore, truly and openly discuss each other’s objectives and expectations in order to achieve a positive problem-solving situation. Informal meetings take place as the parties examine each other’s position. Whether the parties continue to the next stage of the negotiation process depends on the perceived level of cooperation or conflict, of power or dependence and the expected benefits of the relationship. The process often ends in failure if excessive conflict is sensed or if a successful future relationship seems doubtful. The parties should truly see how they are going to cooperate, examine whether it is realistic to expect to achieve the objectives of both sides and to identify the obstacles that have to be overcome to achieve these objectives. The pre-negotiation stage is often more important than the formal negotiations in an international business relationship. Social, informal relationships developed between negotiators at this stage can be of great help. Trust and confidence gained from these relationships increase the chances of agreement. One method of establishing such contacts is to invite individuals from the other side to visit your office/country in an attempt to develop trust. The prime objective here is to get to each other’s priorities. The parties need to understand the interests and fears of the other party. Parties also begin to formulate their strategy for face-to-face negotiation. By strategy we mean a complete plan regarding problems, the solutions available and preferred choices, relative to the other party’s choices and preferences. Parties try to build up their relative power. They compare the alternatives available, make check lists and assign arguments for and against these alternatives. They also decide on possible points of concession and their extent. Parties try to foresee and take precautions against predictable events. Remittance of funds, taxes and import duties and work permits are just some examples of the rules and regulations of the particular country that must be researched at this stage. An understanding of the infrastructure of the country and the company is also critical at this point. In some countries, especially when the public sector is the buyer, purchasing organizations issue a “letter of award” (also called letter of intent/acceptance) after the first stage. The negotiators from Western countries often perceive this letter of award as a grant of contract. However, this is an incorrect assumption, the letter merely indicates the other party’s intention to negotiate further. Parties to international business negotiations should have an initial strategy, which is dependent on the information attained so far and the expectations. The negotiators should list the problems and issues, especially the conflicting issues and form strategies and choices for all possible solutions they or the other party could suggest. These solutions should be ranked in terms such as preferred, desired, expected and not acceptable. If not acceptable, a solution that could be acceptable to the other party should be suggested. It is, thus, important to have several solutions for each problem or issue. Stage II: Face-to-Face Negotiation The basic issue at this stage is that parties believe that they can work together to find a solution to a joint problem. The parties should also be aware that each side views the situation, the matter under discussion, in its own way. Not only that it has a different perception of the process but it has different expectations for the outcome. It is therefore, important to start face-to-face negotiation with an open mind and to have several alternatives. At this stage, as the process continues, the parties should evaluate the alternatives presented by the other party and select those that are compatible with their own expectations. The best way is to determine criteria for judging the alternatives and then rank order each alternative, one’s own as well as those presented by the other party, against these criteria. Here the parties can even help each other in evaluating these alternatives and can discuss the criteria for judgement. The main issue is to explore the differences in preferences and expectations and to come closer to each other. Experience shows that the negotiation process is controlled by the partner who arranges the agenda, since he can emphasize his own strengths and the other party’s weaknesses, thus putting the other party on the defensive. However, the agenda may reveal the preparing party’s position in advance and hence permit the other side to prepare its own counter-arguments on conflicting issues. Some negotiators prefer to start negotiations by discussing and agreeing on broad principles for the relationship. Another way to ensure success at this stage is to negotiate the contract step by step — discussing both conflicting issues and those of common interest. In particular, an initial discussion on items of common interest can create an atmosphere of cooperation between parties. The choice of strategy depends upon the customer or supplier with whom one is negotiating. It is helpful to anticipate the other party’s strategy as early as possible and then to choose a strategy to match or complement it. It is often suggested that the negotiator should not agree to a settlement at once, even if there is considerable overlap of his position with that of the other party. The negotiator may obtain further concessions by prolonging the negotiation process. A number of studies have revealed that negotiators who directly submit a “final offer” can be at a disadvantage. In view of the diverse cultural and business traditions prevailing in different countries, international negotiations inherently involve a discussion of differences. It is very difficult for parties to comprehend or adjust to each other’s culture or traditions, but it is important to be aware of these differences. Social contacts developed between parties are far more significant than the technical and economic specifications in many emerging markets. Negotiators from these countries take their time and are very careful not to offend or use strong words; and the other party is expected to follow suit. A balance between firmness and credibility is important in all types of negotiation. It is important to give and take signals of readiness to move from the initial stage without making concessions. Negotiators having prior dealings with each other can easily send and receive signals, but it is very difficult for those meeting for the first time. Negotiators often send conditional signals such as “We cannot accept your offer as it stands” or “We appreciate that your equipment is quite suitable for us but not at the price you mentioned”. It is also common that the party perceiving greater relative power makes fewer concessions and that the weaker party yields more, often to create a better atmosphere. Maintaining flexibility between parties and issues is of great importance in this stage. These usually occur after both parties have tested the level of commitment and have sent and received signals to move on. For example, the price can be reduced if the party offers better terms of payment. Other elements can be traded off but there may not be a way to evaluate them in accounting terms. For example, an entry into a huge protected market may be strategically more important than obtaining handsome profits on the present deal. Stage III: Post-Negotiation At this stage, all the terms have been agreed upon. The contract is being drawn up and is ready to be signed. Experience has shown that writing the contract and the language used can be a negotiation process in itself, as meaning and values may differ between the two parties. In several cases involving Western firms and emerging-country parties, the language used and the recording of issues previously agreed upon took considerable time. This stage can lead to renewed face-to-face negotiation if there is negative feedback from background factors and atmosphere. Discus- sion should be summarized after negotiations to avoid unnecessary delays in the process. The terms agreed upon should be read by both parties after concessions are exchanged and discussions held, by keeping minutes of meetings, for example. This will help test the understanding of the contract, as parties may have perceived issues or discussions differently. This not only applies to writing and signing the contract but also to its implementation. Trouble may arise later during the implementation of the contract if parties are too eager to reach an agreement and do not pay enough attention to details. The best way to solve this problem is to confirm that both sides thoroughly understand what they have agreed upon before leaving the negotiating table. A skilled negotiator will summarize and test understanding: “Do we understand correctly that if we agree to your terms of payment and repay the credit within three years from the date of the contract, you will reduce the price by 7%?” Cultural Factors As is apparent from the above discussion, cultural factors play an important role in international business negotiations. We have chosen to use the following factors that are most important in this respect: Time Time has different meaning and importance in different cultures. While ‘time is money” in the Western culture, it has no such value attached to it in many cultures in Asia, Latin America and Africa. This influences the pace of negotiations and the punctuality in meetings. For negotiators, it is important to have advance information on the opposite party’s behavior regarding time. This will help them to plan their time as well as to have patience and not to get irritated during the process. Individual vs. Collective Behavior These are rather clear behavioral aspects in different cultures. As indicated by Hofstede’s study of 69 countries, we can place different countries on different scales. Even countries in Western Europe have clear differences in this respect (Hofstede G. 1980). In cases of negotiation, it is important to have knowledge of this cultural attribute, as it will help us to understand the behavior of the other party and to formulate an effective strategy. Knowing whether the opposite party is looking for a collective solution or an individual benefit will help in formulation of arguments and presentations. Pattern of Communication Different cultures have different communication patterns as regards direct vs. indirect and explicit vs. implicit communication. These are related to culture as well as the contextual background of languages (Hall 1960). Some languages are traditionally vague and people from outside find it difficult to communicate with people with such language backgrounds. Indicators such as “maybe”, “perhaps”, “rather”, “I’ll consider it” and “inconvenient” are some examples of ambiguity in international communica- tion and conversation. “Maybe” and “inconvenient” can mean impossible in some cultures. In some cultures even “yes” means “may be” and “perhaps” means “no”. Some languages, for example some Arabic and some Asian languages, traditionally contain exaggerations, fantastic metaphors and repeti- tion, which can be misleading for foreigners. It is, therefore, important to be aware of these aspects and read between the lines. This is even more important in non-verbal communication, the personal space, handshakes, ways of greeting each other, communication between males and females, signs of irritation, etc., are important aspects of communication patterns, and knowl- edge of these can improve the negotiation process and effectiveness. Emphasis on Personal Relations Different cultures give different impor- tance to personal relations in negotiations In many countries in the West, the negotiators are more concerned with the issue at hand and the future relationship between the organizations, irrespective of who is representing these firms, while in some cultures, the personality of the negotiator is more important than the organization he is representing or the importance of an issue. So the emphasis on personal relations can be different in different negotia- tions. Lecture 3. Strategic Factors While negotiating in an international setting, the parties have to prepare thoroughly with respect to how to present things, which type of strategy should be used and which type of decision-making process is followed by the other party. Whether or not they need an agent or an outside consultant is also a question of strategy. Presentations Negotiators have to know whether the presentations to be made are carried out in a formal or informal setting. Whether these are to be made to teams, as in China and Eastern Europe, or to individuals, as in India and the Middle East. The formal vs. informal presentation style is very distinct in many countries. If not prepared, the negotiators can make serious blunders at an early stage of negotiations. It is also important to know whether issues can be presented in groups or whether each issue should be handled individually, and whether presentations should be argumentative or informative, factual and to the point. Strategy There are several types of strategies in business negotiations. The most important are tough, soft or intermediate strategies. In tough strategy, a party starts with a very high initial offer and remains firm on its offer and expects the other party to make the first concession. In soft strategy, a party does not start with a very high initial offer and makes the first concession in the hope that the other party will reciprocate. In intermediate strategy, a party does not start with a very high initial offer and as soon as an offer is made which is within its realistic expectations, it accepts it. It is important to have information on the opposite party’s strategy and to adapt one’s own strategy to it and to have a counter-offer ready. Decision-Making Some information on the other party’s overall decision- making pattern is necessary before going into negotiations. Does the party use impulsive or rational decision-making? Who makes the decisions? Do the negotiators coming to the table have the power to make final decisions or not? These are issues which are important to know in advance. In many cultures in Asia, decision-making is highly influenced by the importance of face-saving and influences the timing of decisions made. Need for an Agent It is part of strategy-formulation to realize whether or not the firm or negotiators can handle the particular negotiation on their own. What type of cost and benefits can be achieved by employing an agent for a particular negotiation process? In our opinion, the more unfamiliar or complicated the other party or the market is, the greater need for an agent or a consultant. These days, specialized agents and consultants are available for different geographic as well as technological areas. There are enormous efficiencies to be achieved by using their expertise. Planning and Managing Negotiations Dozens of books have been written about negotiation, many of which I disagree with. I don’t believe in negotiating through intimidation, fear, bluffing or dishonest tactics. A good negotia- tion concludes as a good deal for every one; negotiation starts with what you want to accomplish. Then the realities and, sometimes, the complexities enter the picture. Sometimes many points of view and many elements have to be considered, but the deal itself must always be kept in view. Your first step should be to rid yourself of an adversarial position. The reality is that you have a mutual problem, which you are going to solve to your mutual advantage. The intention must be to structure a deal that resolves the problem and gives each of you what you want. It’s not always possible, of course. When it can’t be done, you are better off making no deal than making a bad deal. A bad deal usually brings a future filled with enormous problems. Negotiat- ing demands a recognition of reality on many levels. Only amateurs try to accomplish something that isn’t real or possible; it is an attempt that inevitably leads to failure. Amateurs tend to dream; professionals consider the realities of a deal. In the past, the ability to negotiate was considered innate or instinctive but it is now regarded as a technique which can be learned. Experimental studies, empirical observations and experience have made it possible to grasp the art of negotiation. This section provides some guidelines for planning and managing the negotiation process in three stages. The Pre-Negotiation Stage The most important success factor in negotiation is preparation and planning. One may have excellent negotiating skills, persuasive and convincing communication style, a strong market position and relative power but all these cannot overcome the shortcomings caused by poor preparation. As mentioned in the previous section, the presence of cooperation as well as conflict and the relative power/dependence in international business negotiation demands careful preparation and planning. In the problem-solving approach, this becomes even more important as both parties do truly want to do business with each other. In spite of this cooperative behavior, negotiation involves trade-off between own and joint interests. A number of authors have stressed the importance of preparation and planning for negotiation. Identify the Contents of the Deal The initial points to consider are issues such as implications of the deal, the interests at stake, the “fit” with organizational objectives, and possible economic, political or other restrictions between parties. What will each gain or lose and how important is the deal for them? What alternatives does either side have? These issues must be considered in terms of tangible and intangible motives. Comparison of one’s own and the other party’s strengths and weaknesses is quite important. In business negotiations, the other party does not only include the buyer or the party you are negotiating with, but also the competitors who also have an interest in the same business. In most cases, a party’s arguments or preferences are influenced by the offers other competitors have made. Many negotiators use professional investigators for this task of getting information on the other parties and to find their weaknesses. According to one estimate, in the United States, 800 million is annually spent on industrial spying (Harrison & Saffer 1980). In our opinion, the information required to prepare and plan for negotiation need not include such rather unethical methods. It is quite easy to get a lot of information from the annual accounts of the firms and through talking to their executives, customers and suppliers. In international business relations, buy-back arrangements are becoming more common, and in large international deals with emerging markets, buyers are demanding some sort of a buy-back. For more details on this issue. Emerging countries engage in countertrade deals to correct their trade deficits as well as to earn hard currency. It is important to calculate deals in monetary terms when conducting trade in this medium. The seller might end up with goods which cannot be easily marketed in the home country. The countertrade demand can be just a bluff, so that the seller who seeks to avoid the expenses of buy-back may offer a major price discount. The plant’s output supplied under the particular contract is part of the payment in some cases. China uses its cheap labor and re-exports products from local plants to the seller’s country. Another example is the iron-producing Carajas project in northern Brazil Most of the production of this complex is exported to Japan to pay for project financing. Create Alternatives To negotiate effectively, the marketer must gather information on the strengths and weaknesses not only of the opposite party, but also of the other related parties such as competitors. By considering the resources and behavior of competitors, marketers can develop their own alternatives on different issues. There are several strategies by which the seller can pre-empt competitors, for example, offering credit to the buyer, price reductions or long guarantee periods. Sellers must also allow for alternative solutions to conflicting issues. Question one’s own position: ‘What if they do not accept this . . .?” Quite often Western negotiators believe they have only three options: (i) persuasion; (ii) threat; or (iii) concession. In fact, there are many alternative solutions to a problem. Different issues can be combined to produce numerous alternatives. If the customer demands a 5% concession on the price, the other party can ask the customer to pay cash instead of the one-year credit proposed. In one case, the buyer demanded a 5% concession on the contract price after everything else had been agreed upon. The seller instead proposed that he was willing to give a 10% rebate on all the spare parts to be bought by the buyer during the next three years. This offer was accepted gladly by the buyer. One way of creating alternatives is to judge each conflicting issue in the following scale: our ideal position their ideal position. Here we should look for overlaps, is there any overlap of our and their position? If not, how can we create an overlap? What can be their minimum acceptable position? What is our minimum acceptable position? Can we move from there, perhaps give up on this issue and gain in another one which is not so sensitive to the other party, but equally important to us? Put Yourself in their Shoes For negotiations to be successful, one party must understand the other party’s position. This will help each side interpret and anticipate the other side’s reactions to arguments. Anticipating and developing rational reactions to arguments allows each party to formulate new arguments and alternatives. This stimulates flexibility on different conflicting issues. Each party has to recognize the needs of the other, quite apart from gathering information and asking questions to check the other party’s position. Being a patient listener will help improve negotiations. One can understand the meaning behind the words by listening attentively. One can create a positive and cooperative atmosphere in the negotiation process by showing the other party that he or she is well understood. However, be careful while listening — it is not what is said, but how it is said that is more important and one should read between the lines. The harder a party tries to show understanding of the opposing viewpoint, the more open it will be to alternative solutions. A universal feeling exists that those who understand are intelligent and sympathetic. Parties feel obliged to reciprocate in these situations. The ability to look at the situation from the other’s point of view is one of the most important skills in negotiations. It is important not only to see as the other party sees, but also to understand the other party’s point of view and the power of its arguments. Gauge the Appropriateness of the Message The information exchanged must be adjusted for easier comprehension by the other party. Technical specifications and other material should be provided in the local language. Not only does this facilitate effective communication but it also demonstrates respect for the local language and environment. The problems of perception and language barriers often cause difficulties in the negotiation process. This is frustrating and places an added burden on all parties involved in the negotiating process. Different cultures interpret messages differently. An octopus is said to have several arms in the United States. It is said to have several legs in Japan. In Sweden, “next Sunday” does not mean the coming Sunday but the Sunday after. In India “next Sunday” means the coming Sunday. “Nice weather” means sunshine in Europe. “Nice weather” means cloudy or rainy weather in Africa and many Asian countries. The exchange of gifts and terms of reciprocity are quite normal in Asia, yet considered close to a bribe in many Western countries. It is important that negotiators adopt appropriate behavior for each negotiation. The chosen arguments should be tailored to the particular customer. One standard argument cannot be used throughout the world. Barriers to communication also arise from real or perceived differences in expectations, which create conflict instead of cooperation between parties. In cross-cultural negotiations, non-verbal communication, in particular in the expression of emotions and the attitude of a negotiator toward the other party, is sometimes more important than the spoken language. Non-verbal commu- nication can be telling. Liking and disliking, tensions and appraisal of an argument are shown by numerous signs such as blushing, contraction of facial muscles, giggling, strained laughter or just silence. People, sitting down, lean forward when they like what you are saying or are interested in listening, or they sit back on their seat with crossed arms if they do not like the message. Nervousness can manifest itself through non-verbal behavior, and blinking can be related to feelings of guilt and fear. It is difficult to evaluate non-verbal communication, as it is connected to the subconscious and emotions. Effective communication and understanding of people will assist you in adjusting your arguments to the moods and expectations of the other party. Negotiators may continue to hold out, not because the proposal from the other side is unacceptable, but because they want to avoid feelings of surrender. Sometimes simple rephrasing of the proposal or a different approach to the presentation can alleviate the problem. Build Up Relative Power Negotiators can determine who has the relative power advantage by gathering information about the other party, considering each party’s position and developing different alternatives. They can try to build their own relative power by developing arguments against the elements of power and improving their own position. In the negotiation process, this kind of power may be increased by repeatedly mentioning the weak points of the other party. The uncertainty regarding infrastructure and exchange rates must be handled here. Parties can agree on adjustments in the event of exchange rate variations. The party with greater information automatically acquires more power. The negotiator may have to work as a detective to ascertain the buyer’s needs, his strong and weak points, and the strong and weak points of competitors. By being active in the negotiation process an experienced negotiator can build up information in order to gain relative power. This can be done by asking the other party questions. It can also be done by giving conditional answers such as “If you agree to pay cash . . . then we can consider looking at our price”, or “What if we agree to pay cash perhaps then you can lower the price by 5%”. The Face-to-Face Negotiation Stage Who Within the Firm Should Negotiate? A difficult question arises regarding who should conduct negotiations whenever a deal is to be made in a new market. Who is the most appropriate person to hammer out a particular deal? In fact, persons involved in international business negotiation can do more harm than good if they lack an integrated knowledge of their own firm and the objective of the deal. Whoever is selected for negotiations must have a good grasp of the deal’s implications. This is especially true when long-term relationships are being discussed. One way to minimize this risk is to appoint a negotiation team, where the key members are selected from different departments. Expendable Person It is important for management to realize that the selected person(s) should be expendable without creating organizational problems. When replacement is necessary, management must be able to escape deadlock. Sometimes negotiations and in an impasse and you may have to start with new players. It is also possible that the selected negotiators and the other party cannot reach a meeting of minds if there is a clash of personal chemistry. It may become necessary to change negotiators in such situations. This discussion gives rise to another question. From which level should the executives for the negotiations be chosen? In most countries, parties expect to negotiate with members of equal status. The managing director from one side expects to negotiate with his counterpart. It is advisable that firms match like with like. Individuals vs. Teams Parties need to consider not only who should represent the company but also the number of negotiators, i.e. whether one goes for individual or team negotiations Team negotiation affords marketers the opportunity to benefit from the advice and guidance of many participants. It is difficult for a single individual to be adept in all kinds of commercial, technical and legal issues. The best way however, is to conform to the opposite party. If the opposite side is coming with a team, we should also send a team. What Makes a Good Negotiator? A number of studies identify character- istics of a good negotiator. Ikle defined a good negotiator as one having a “quick mind but unlimited patience, know how to dissemble without being a liar, inspire trust without trusting others, be modest but assertive, charm others without succumbing to their charm, and possess plenty of money and a beautiful wife while remaining indifferent to all temptations of riches and women”. A marketer’s personality and social behavior are of equal importance to social contacts and formal negotiation in many emerging countries. Depending upon their behavior, negotiators are often grouped into different categories, such as bullies, avoiders or acceptors. Bullies want to threaten, push, demand or attack. Avoiders like to avoid conflicting situations and hide in fear of making a wrong decision or being held responsible. They will normally refer to their superiors for a final decision, “I have to call my head office . . .”. Acceptors always give a very positive answer and say “Yes” to almost anything, which makes it difficult to realize which “Yes” is “Yes” and which “Yes” is “Maybe”, and whether they will be able to deliver what they are promising or not. The best way to handle these behavior types is to first identify them and then confront them by drawing a limit, helping them feel safe and by asking them how and when they would be able to do what they are promising. Patience It is essential to know the negotiators’ precise authority. In Eastern Europe and China, one team may negotiate one day, followed by a fresh team the next day. When this process is repeated a number of times, it becomes very difficult for negotiators to establish who is the negotiating party and who has the final authority. One of the characteristics of a good negotiator is the ability to discover the timetable of the other party and allow plenty of time for the negotiation process. It is usually not feasible to expect to fly to a distant country, wrap things up and be home again in a week. Nor is it reasonable to coerce a party that is not ready to reach a decision. Negotiations with emerging market customers take a long time! Patience and time are the greatest assets a negotiator can have while negotiating with customers from these markets. Some negotiators take their time, discussing all issues and justifying their role through tough negotiations. Negotiators must be in a position to change their strategies and arguments, as the process of negotiation is highly dynamic. They must be flexible. The other party will often ask questions, probing the seller’s weaknesses, just to provoke and obtain more concessions. It is important to keep calm and find out first if the questions asked are relevant and justified. Negotiators can use this in their favor if questions are not justified and the buyer has wrong information. A good negotiator is not just a person who can conclude an apparently good contract for the company or one who can arrive at a contract in a short time. A good negotiator is one whose agreements lead to successful implementation. The Post-Negotiation Stage What is a Good Outcome? A good agreement is one which leads to successful implementation. There are many examples of firms getting into trouble because they could not implement the contract conditions of a particular deal. Therefore, in some cases, no agreement may be a better outcome for the firm. A good outcome benefits both parties and does not make either party feel that it has a less advantageous contract. Sometimes negotiators want to avoid specifying some issues and want to keep them ambiguous. It is important to understand that on the one hand, ambiguity can lead to reopening of the conflict later on, in the implementation stage, and on the other hand, if we want to specify such issues, it might prolong the negotiation process or prevent an agreement. Sometimes, this ambiguity is unintended, whereas, on other occasions, it is intentionally deployed to speed up the process or to give the impression that the particular issue needs to be re-negotiated. It is normally considered that a good business deal is one which provides financial gains. But what were the objectives of the firm when it decided to enter into negotiations? Was it the present deal which was most important or was it future business? The outcome must be related to the firm’s objectives. If the objectives have been met then it is a good outcome. A successful negotiation is not a question of “win-lose” but a problem-solving approach to a “win-win” outcome. The main purpose of the contract is to avoid misunderstandings and trouble in the future. The agreement should foster relationship development and be flexible enough to deal with expected or unexpected future changes. The language and terminology used in the contract must be simple and clear. It must not be necessary to seek legal help every time the contract is consulted. THEORY AND PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS PART 2. Strategies and Tactics in International Business Negotiations Lecture 1. Strategic Potential for International Business Negotiations When the parties involved in business communication, in particular, in business negotiations, are preparing for their future activities they have to consider a number of issues and to choose a proper strategy and proper tactics. Their considerations are as follows: We have now staked out the framework for a successful negotiation. We know our needs. We know exactly what we want. We also have an idea what our negotiation partner wants of us, and what we can offer him. To put all this together in a single package will require considerable patience, creativity and cooperation. First of all, we need to make a careful decision about strategy and tactics. These are familiar terms, but what exactly is the difference between them? And above all, which of them is the more important? Strategy and Tactics Both are necessary, but a clear distinction needs to be made between them. Strategy is the overall guideline, indicating the direction we need to take from our wishes and needs to our objectives. If, given a set of specific interests and objectives, we choose the wrong strategy, we will be setting a wrong course from the very start. We would then be very lucky to get where we want to go. Tactics, on the other hand, always follow after strategy, fleshing it out with a concrete line of action. If strategy is the thought, then tactics are its formulation. If we are going to get our message across, both will be necessary — but the thought comes before the word. Tactics should not be directly oriented towards the objectives, but towards the strategy. For this reason they may sometimes take an unexpected turn, which may appear to be at odds with the general direction we are going. But as long strategy has been served, Figure 2.1: Strategic context of negotiations. the choice of tactic will have been a good one. Nor is the shortest route necessarily the best — sometimes we first need to overcome an obstacle, or work our way around it. Any tactic is suitable, as long as it achieves its aim — ideally of course with the smallest possible expenditure of time and effort. Tactical action is considerably more flexible than strategy in this regard: it is also correspondingly more versatile and adaptable to changing conditions. Positions in the Conflict In the case of strategy, our room for maneuver is considerably narrower. Each position in a conflict can be charted along two axes: assertion and cooperation. The assertion element describes the fervor with which someone goes about having their wishes satisfied, while their readiness to cooperate will bring the interests of the other side into the equation. We can construct a grid based on these two axes, which allows us to define five different behaviors in conflict management (see Figure 3.2). On account of the major significance they have on the course of negotiations, these positions and their advantages and drawbacks will be discussed in detail in the sections that follow. The choice of which of the five basic positions is the most appropriate for a given conflict depends on the type of task at hand, the situation, and the personality of the negotiator. Later we shall see how this choice is made, Figure 2.2: Modes of conflict management. using different examples. So let us start with the five basic positions in a given conflict. Competition To push hard to get what we want may be effective, but it is not cooperative. Its thrust is to put through our own aims exclusively, without heed to the other, in the shape of a distributive result, a zero-sum game. Such power-oriented behavior uses all available means to attain the goal sought after — persuasive powers, pulling rank, or quite simply a stronger economic position, for example. We might fight for our rights, for a good cause, or simply for our own profit. Nothing is more appropriate if it is a matter of demonstrating our own strength or authority — even if we don’t really have them. Such conduct has all the romance of the Wild West: a real man wins against all the odds! This may indeed be impressive, but it is also extremely disturbing, such as when a street trader or door-to-door salesman just won’t give up and obdurately pressurizes the helpless victim into a sale. Nobody likes that. The person who advocates his cause energetically will have the advantage of initiative — like the white pieces on the chessboard, which are always one move ahead. But such hectic pressure and activity gets in the way of receptivity. It leads to impatience and loss of flexibility. The warrior obsessed by the pursuit of victory in his campaign is also at risk of missing important signals from his adversary. They want to exert their will and master the other. If both parties resort to such tactics, the inevitable result is confrontation, a battle of wills. One of them must give way or be bettered in the final showdown. In certain cases such stubborn maintenance of a position may be a good idea, but it leaves little room for cooperative approaches and a constructive solution to the conflict. Collaboration Constructive collaboration is also demanding in its way, but it is much more than that. It represents an attempt to find a solution in tandem with the other, that takes full account of the desires and interests of both parties. In the terminology expressed in this study, it corresponds to integrative bargaining. Collaboration simply requires that both parties familiarize themselves thoroughly with the conflict and its causes, and work towards finding a joint approach. This is almost always possible: there is a creative solution to be found for most problems if both sides pull together. With a little goodwill they can work through the differences that separate them and — without losing sight of their own principles — learn something from the other’s point of view and experience. They might consider specific points as a separate issue, or put them to one side straight away, so as to open up the way to an overall agreement. As we have already seen, a decisive factor in such an agreement is to satisfy at least some of our partner’s wishes. This implies the greatest possible understanding of the other’s needs. Why should the negotiating partners not address their personal differences and clear them up in a climate of cooperation? Such a strategy creates mutual trust and has the great merit of far-sightedness. It does not have any real weaknesses, but does require a readiness to collaborate from both parties Compromise A compromise is possible when each party meets the other half way. Something is demanded, but it is not absolute. Some cooperation occurs, but not the whole way. The purpose of compromise is to achieve a solution that is tolerably acceptable to both parties, that is at least partially satisfactory to each of them. Splitting the difference also lies halfway on the assertion and cooperation axes — illustrated by the diagonal from top left to bottom right in Figure 3.2. When we reach a compromise we don’t relinquish everything, but nor do we get everything we want, either. Such a solution will lie between the positions of avoidance and collaboration: it does not avoid the conflict, but nor does it go so far into the sort of detail a readiness for new alternatives would require. It is much more superficial. The compromise also lies at the center point of the other diagonal. This aptly illustrates the expression, to meet one another half way, where the parties make moves towards one another or look for a rapid agreement that is just about acceptable to them. At least then, some agreement will have been struck. The compromise is widely used as a device in politics and diplomacy, where it is highly esteemed as the art of the possible. If neither side is able or willing to make further concessions (because their mandate is limited), it is often the only option, which by definition is therefore the best. In another context a mixture of cowardice and avidity may lead to a bad compromise, where the partners apparently did not have the courage or the generosity of mind to look for better alternatives, even though their mandate would have allowed one. A compromise may well be the best solution in many cases, but it is more likely only to appear so. Avoidance Avoidance is always possible as a no-win solution. Instead of insisting on their demands or cooperating, the negotiator withdraws from the conflict and forgoes an agreement. In this he or she is serving neither their own interests nor those of the opponent. They simply avoid coming to grips with the problem; perhaps because the opponent seems too powerful and a confrontation does not appear to have any prospects of success. In such a case a tactic worth recommending might be to let the opponent thrash about in the air for a moment — similar to the technique used to such effect in the Japanese martial arts aikido and jujitsu, which indeed constitutes a favorite ploy of Japanese management. The avoidance strategy may have a very diplomatic quality, with awkward issues being put on ice and postponed until a more favorable moment. If an agreement does not yet seem possible, conscious avoidance may help to prevent damaging an otherwise good relationship with the other party. It is far better to duck away at the right moment than to experience disappointment later, or set it up. But avoidance may also come up in the shape of the ostrich policy, when one of the parties sticks the head in the sand and plays the waiting game. This is one way of deflecting a situation that threatens to be dangerous, but it will rarely be sufficient to defuse it completely. In cases such as this evasive action is a very circumspect and conservative way of responding. It does not involve much risk: nothing is ventured, but nothing much is lost. It also has the characteristic of covering up one’s own interests or positions quite effectively. It forestalls the sort of discussion in which the other side might be apprised of important information. Certainly, such an attitude does not exactly make a friendly impression on the partner at the receiving end of the rebuff, but to opt out at a later date could cause much greater damage. Avoidance is an extremely versatile and thus useful position to take in such a situation. But like the other positions, it should only be used in a very targeted manner. Certainly, it should not be seen as a stock solution. The over-frequent avoidance of conflict whittles down our own expectations and thus minimizes the chances of truly satisfactory results in the future. Accommodation Accommodation is the opposite of competition. It is not assertiveness, but rather it is very cooperative. The negotiator renounces most of his objectives. In order to satisfy his opponent, he or she sacrifices their own interests — either from selfless generosity or forced obedience. Were the arguments of the other side so convincing, that our negotiator could only be convinced? Was he perhaps even converted? Straightforward capitulation is an effective strategy in its way, when it’s a matter of defusing an escalating conflict or simply to re- establish a friendly atmosphere. But it may be read as an invitation for more demands. Giving in may also frequently be interpreted as weakness and as a sign of naive gullibility (or a just punishment for it!). But as a strategy it should not be rejected out of hand — everything depends on the objective and the circumstantial details. Which Position, When? Since these various positions are diametrically opposed to one another, the question automatically arises, which position should we adopt in a given situation? Although as a matter of principle cooperation is the best choice, it is not always available as an option. In this section we present four important criteria on which to evaluate strategies when confronted with a specific problem. Figure 2.3: Determinants of conflict behavior. Let us begin with the vertical axis. How do we know how far we can go with our demands, and how forcefully we should present them? How much cooperation should we offer, and how much can we expect from the other side? What is at Stake? The first consideration underpinning this decision is: how vital is this negotiation for me? What is at stake here? If a failure would drive me to the wall, I am going to want to put more of my energy into it than if it were just a matter of buying a new telephone answering machine. I will want to fight every inch of the way to maintain my position or, better, work together with my opposite number to achieve an optimum outcome. At the very least I will want an acceptable compromise, if that is the best alternative the circumstances have to offer — always a better solution than to give up an important negotiation without any agreement at all. But one thing is certain, I am not going to give up if the outcome means everything to me, or when a precedent would be established. For if I give way now, then other people are going to expect a similar deal in comparable cases in the future. To give way now would mean to give way again, and again, . . . and again? The power balance between the participants has a similar impact on the course of events. This is something of a self-evidence: the one who has the power to impose their demands is in general likely to do so. Unless of course they are pursuing a quite different objective. The mere availability of power thus does not necessarily mean that it is going to be brought to bear in a given case. But clearly the very possibility that it might — whether on our own part or that of the other — is going to have a considerable or even decisive impact on the choice of strategy. For the side that has the power in its hands can resort to it at any time. That is the principle of deterrence. There is no point in attacking an adversary who is stronger than you. As important as an accurate assessment of one’s own power, therefore, is the most accurate possible assessment of the adversary. For this, we need to understand the sources and basis of power. Common Interests Let us now turn our attention to the horizontal axis, which introduces two new variables that affect the level of cooperation: common interests and the quality of the personal relationship. Let us start with the first of these: it is natural to expect that the more the interests of the parties coincide, the more they will want to cooperate. If both are going for the same objective, they are more likely to pull together than if their aims are diametrically opposed. Conversely, the fewer interests the two sides have in common, the less cooperation will be an ingredient of their bargaining efforts. We don’t need to dwell on that. But it is a good idea to be clear about even such simple steps of logic when we are devising our strategy. A similar situation obtains when it comes to adapting our own position in the course of the negotiation, as we shall see later in the chapter. Relationship Quality The scope for cooperation also depends on the quality of the personal relationship between the negotiating partners. This too is such an obvious point that it sometimes risks being forgotten. Clearly, all of us behave differently towards a friend than we would towards a completely unfamiliar discussion partner, not to speak of a notorious double dealer in the trade. If we have had the positive experience of a negotiating partner, who has proved himself or herself to be serious and reliable in our eyes, the way is wide open to cooperation. And of course the converse is equally true: our partner is going to need to feel that we are sufficiently trustworthy before wanting to cooperate with us. Both parties have to earn their right to cooperation. But there is of course always the possibility that despite a good personal relationship too many differences of interest stand in the way of an agreement being obtained through cooperation. In such a case the result is likely to be a compromise, or one of the parties will give way in order not to sully the good relations. Both may even choose to side-step the conflict between interest and relationship, and not pursue the deal. As we have seen, each position on the grid described can be defined by four readily assessable criteria — relative power, outcome stakes, interest interdependence and relationship quality. On this basis, we can plot our own position on the grid as well as that of our partner in terms of demands and cooperation. True, this is not enough to resolve any conflicts that may arise, but an appreciation of the positions on both sides may be quite valuable when it comes to developing an appropriate strategy. Lecture 2. Strategic Potential for International Business Negotiations ( continued). The theoretical issues set previously should now be illustrated by examples. For Example: Business Lunch with IBM The following example will show how effective it is to cultivate good personal relations. The movement along the horizontal axis in this case made it possible to pass from avoidance (on the part of the IBM representative) to collaboration. Long before she became president of the advertising agency’s North American operations, Ogilvy & Mather’s Rochelle Lazarus had a sense of personal relations with clients. For several years she had lunched every day with former or current clients, cultivating relationships and the proverbial good connections, and not only at top executive level. In every company that she worked for — in the first third of her career, that included American Express — she knew armies of people in influential positions at all levels and in all sorts of departments. This enormous effort – to say nothing of the restaurant checks – paid off after several years for her company: in 1992 she won back American Express’s charge-card advertising account for Ogilvy. But the really big deal came two years later, when her good relations enabled her to reel in the 400 million-plus account of the computer giant IBM. She would of course never have landed such a prize without the qualifications and proven successes of her employer. But an internal note at IBM indicated that the contacts of many years standing between Ms Lazarus with IBM president Louis V. Gerstner and his vice-president of corporate marketing, Abby Kohnstamm, were instrumental in swinging the giant’s decision to put the account in the hands of Ogilvy & Mather. Ms Lazarus’s relations with client executives went a long way to making IBM feel that the risk of investing in a new campaign was considerably less than it might have been. Indeed she had begun to cultivate her good connections with her clients Gerstner and Kohnstamm when they were still on the payroll of American Express. At that time she could have no notion of the exceptional deal with IBM she was to snare years later. In addition to illustrating the important role of good personal relations with major negotiating partners, this example once again demonstrates the strategic significance of the long view. (based on Wall Street Journal 1994). Choice of Strategy We have now studied the basic positions and looked at their application through a number of examples. Which brings us to the important question of which position that we should adopt in a given situation. There is no all-embracing answer to this question. First, our own personal disposition will have a definite influence on the strategy we choose. A good negotiator will master the whole gamut of possibilities, and be able to put himself or herself behind any one of the five basic positions. But each of us has some individual preferences — one likes to push the way through, another will tend to draw back, while a third is more comfortable looking for new alternatives. This personal aspect should not be underrated, as the following example illustrates: For Example: Switzerland “The Swiss go into a negotiation with a compromise and finish it with avoidance or confrontation”. This less than generous judgment of the abilities of the alpine republic is doubtless formulated a little too harshly, but it is not without a grain of truth. Someone will perhaps brush off this statement as a self-effacing remark from an author who is himself Swiss, with considerable experience of negotiating in his home country. But we have in fact accumulated empirical evidence to support this statement. The instrument used was MODE, Management of Difficult Exercises, a questionnaire developed to determine the preferred positions taken up in conflict resolution, which we submitted to 184 diplomats, senior civil servants, managers, bankers and students. The results showed a distinct preference for compromise and avoidance. This result, which was obtained uniformly through all the occupational groups investigated, seems logical in a country that not only depends on various neighboring countries and their markets, but is divided up internally into several disparate ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic communities. Without a predilection for compromise and avoidance of conflict on the part of the population, civil war is a far from remote possibility. This basic attitude is also recognizable in the government of this federal state by consensus of the seven members of the Federal Council (government ministers), who are nominated by the main political parties using a highly detailed key. A similar mentality is found in the industrial sector, which is dominated by cartels, or in the collective wage rounds, which for decades have guaranteed the country absolute social peace. Switzerland’s position in diplomatic negotiations, for example with the European Communities, also reveals a natural tendency towards compromise. In the face of its far larger and more powerful neighbors, Switzerland has no negotiating power to speak of, yet the agreements debated often have major significance for the Swiss economy. The country’s interests rarely coincide with those of the large European states, and relations with individual neighbors may not be too close in consideration of the various ethnic and linguistic groups of which Switzerland is composed. Otherwise there is a real danger that the federal state could break up. Active neutrality is the logical conclusion of this careful balancing act. An interesting example of how Switzerland deals with conflict is given by the many negotiations it holds with the European Communities. These are succinctly illustrated in Figure 2.4. In the first phase from 1957 to 1972, the EEC was seen as a threat; membership would therefore never have been accepted by the people. In its search for a solution, Berne chose to participate in the establishment of the European Free Trade Association, EFTA. At the same time a free trade agreement was signed between EFTA and the EC countries, which made it possible for all EFTA countries, including Switzerland, to remain immune from the discrimination brought about by the EC customs union. With the switch from partnerships with major nations from EFTA such as the United Kingdom, to the EC, a new balance of power came into being between EFTA and the European Communities. Switzerland set its course on the avoidance of new discriminations and in the space of a single year concluded more than 130 bilateral agreements with EC countries (for example in the fields of research cooperation, improved market access for specific agricultural products, etc.). Between 1989 and 1992 this course changed from avoidance to active cooperation, when membership of the European Economic Area appeared inescapable. But the hard-won agreement was then turned down by the people Figure 2.4: Relations between Switzerland and EEC, EC and EU. of Switzerland in a popular referendum in 1992. Since that time, tension has reigned between Switzerland and the European Union. The situation was largely remedied by tough sectoral negotiations, which were concluded in 1999. A referendum was organized to oppose this bilateral agreement, and the Swiss people will now cast their vote for or against it in May 2000. If the vote goes in favor, Switzerland will once again have managed to negotiate an arrangement with the European Union that allows it to remain free from serious discrimination by the latter. But if the agreement is rejected, pressure on the part of the EU will increase. Even if the sectoral agreements are accepted, it is quite conceivable that Switzerland will not remain aloof for long and will finally one day take up membership of the EU. Strategic Analysis We have seen the role played by individual disposition in the choice of strategy in the example of Switzerland. While it is necessary to take the subjective inclination towards a particular position into account, we need to look at it critically: is the preferred strategy really suited to solving a specific conflict? It feels much more important to regard the objective side of the matter, provided that the negotiator is able to distance himself or herself from his personal preferences. Each conflict demands a completely new assessment of the situation, just as does each change in the position of the other side. The following section will deal with the adaptation of a chosen strategy to changing circumstances. At this point we would like to present a useful decision tool, with the help of which we can readily define our initial position. When all the questions have been answered carefully for each of the four determinants addressed, the checklist reproduced in Table 2.3 provides a very informative figure. But just what information this number conveys becomes clear only when it is entered into the corresponding scale in Figure 2.5 as a vertical or horizontal line. The checklist answers thus produce two horizontal and two vertical lines. We now turn our attention to the rectangle enclosed by these four lines. It may be useful to highlight it by coloring it in. Referring back now to the diagram (Figure 2.2), the position of our rectangle will show us where we stand in respect of the five fundamental positions in the context of the conflict we are currently dealing with. Adapting Strategy We now have a clear basis on which to define where we stand — but that by no means implies that we have to remain in this starting position. Depending on the position adopted by the other side, we will want to vary our own as the talks progress. The strategy may even be defined by a movement from one position to another: “The true policy is to confront power with power at a selected point where a decision in a military sense is possible, and then to use the delicate and unstable equilibrium as an opportunity to be seized for constructive and magnanimous negotiation” (Walter Lippmann 1946). The sequence and timing of the various positions may have a conclusive effect, as a famous example from Japanese management philosophy shows: “When the enemy attacks, remain undisturbed but feign weakness. As the enemy reaches you, suddenly move away indicating that you intend to jump aside, then dash in attacking strongly as soon as you see the enemy relax. This is one way” (Musashi, Miyamoto 1982). The author of this directive, Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645), is a very interesting man. He was a Samurai whose writings are still used as the theoretical basis for countless management seminars.

The above principle could represent a skilful strategy for introducing a new product. The tentative introduction of a relatively unimportant or an inferior product (signaling weakness) is merely a feint to mislead the competition. While they lean back and relax, the real product is put onto the market, with full power behind it. Starting from the five positions presented earlier, there are a total of 16 possible routes linking each pair (see Figure 3.6). I One can interpret what each of these signifies in practice. All the options are open when it comes to deciding whether to pass from a confrontational stance to one of evasion or cooperation. Depending on the circumstances, any of the routes shown may constitute the optimum strategy.the largest possible area of the board with the stones of their own color. Once a stone (or several stones) has been surrounded, it is removed from the board. Otherwise all the stones remain where they were placed on the board, making up a complex network of local battlefields. A good player will evolve sophisticated strategies from the respective positions of the stones in relation to one another, so that at the end of the game he is in control of more than half of the free points (known as “liberties”) remaining on the board. The individual groups or chains of stones (“armies”) can form alliances to enable them to Figure 2.5: Strategic positioning grid Figure 2.6: Sixteen strategic paths. move in on the enemy forces and finally capture them. They can also limit themselves to securing their own territory by establishing an effective and invincible barrier around it. It is also possible to make forays behind the opponent’s lines with the aim of linking up with other friendly stones and so to capture enemy territory from behind. Figure 2.7 presents two simple examples of strategy and tactics in Go. The three diagrams along the top row show how the coordinated placing of his stones has permitted white to surround and capture three black stones. By placing a white stone on 1, white has surrounded black and is able to take out Figure 2.7: GO: Japanese game of strategy. three black stones. With this strategy white has won territory for himself and has established a superior and invulnerable position. The situation is quite different for black in the second example (bottom row): while he is able to capture two white stones, he then finds himself threatened by the remaining white stones. Black needs to secure the point marked with a 1, if he is to protect himself from the forthcoming white offensive. At first glance the similarity between this extremely exciting board game and conducting negotiations will perhaps not be very obvious. But anyone who needs to bargain frequently with partners from the Far East will rapidly find a study of the game invaluable. For all its exotic airs — and in passing, it is regarded as the world’s oldest board game — it is able to reflect each and every one of the strategies we have already spoken. For Example: IBM To conclude, the following example shows how a multinational corporation was obliged to harmonize its strategy with the position held by the government of a host country, and immediately adapt it to any new position taken up. It contains many of the elements presented here and so serves as an excellent application of the theories dealt with here. Once again we are looking at the computer and office machine producer, International Business Machines, known the world over as IBM. Since the 1970s, multinational concerns such as IBM have found themselves faced with an increasingly tougher stance on the part of many emerging nations on the political and economic fronts. Whereas in 1951 IBM could still be invited to India and received with open arms by Prime Minister Nehru, twenty years later the wind had changed radically. In the interval, IBM had succeeded in achieving almost complete control of the Indian computer market. The Indian government felt this to be a dangerous dependence from the strategic standpoint and pressed the firm to reduce its 100% ownership to 40%, a holding that still constituted a blocking minority. IBM was also enjoined to extend its computer design and manufacturing operations in India for both the domestic and export markets. IBM was highly reluctant to deviate from its traditional global policy on account of a new attitude on the part of the Indian government. So the concern changed its position towards India from collaboration to heavy Figure 2.8: Strategic position of IBM in India. confrontation. The equity dilution demanded by India could not be counte-nanced at IBM. However, a similarly rigid position on the part of the Indian government forced IBM to propose a range of concessions in the hope of a compromise. But India rejected IBM’s proposals. This led the computer giant to adopt a position which was as unfortunate as it was surprising for the Indian government: IBM considered the Indian demands to be a serious threat to its global strategy and renounced its activities in the subcontinent. When finally there was no longer any hope of compromise, the concern decided to turn to a policy of avoidance: on 15 November 1977 it announced its complete withdrawal from India. ТЕМА 3 Cultural Aspects of International Business Communications Lecture 1. The Concept of Culture in International Business Communications Some researchers have questioned the very fact that cultural differences have an impact on international business communication, arguing that negotiation is negotiation irrespective of where and with whom it takes place: Culture is to negotiation what birds flying into engines are to flying airplanes or, at most, what weather is to aerodynamics — practical impediments that need to be taken into account (and avoided) once the basic process is fully understood and implemented. However, there is now much empirical support for the view that culture has an impact on business communications. Support is coming as well from authors actually involved in international negotiations. When negotiating internationally, one needs cultural knowledge and skills in intercultural communication. Many agreements have to be negotiated, drafted, signed and finally implemented: sales contracts, licensing agreements, joint ventures and various kinds of partnerships, agency and distribution agreements, turnkey contracts, etc. Negotiation is not only based on legal and business matters, hard facts which are often emphasized as being the sole important facts, but also on the quality of human and social relations, “soft facts” which become of the utmost importance in an intercultural encounter. Goldman emphasizes, for instance, the importance to the Japanese of ningensei which, literally translated, means an all-encompassing and over- riding concern and prioritising of “humanity” or human beingness (see Box 5.1). According to Japanese specialists in international marketing negotiations: The North American and U.K. negotiators failed to communicate ningensei at the first table meeting. Rushing into bottom lines and demanding quick decisions on the pending contract, they also overlooked the crucial need for ningensei in develop- ing good will . . . Hard business facts alone are not enough . . . Ningensei is critical in getting Japanese to comply or in persuading Japanese negotiating partners. There are various kinds of “distances” between the potential partners: physical distance certainly, but also economic, educational and cultural distance, which tend to inflate the cost of negotiating internationally. Difficulties in interacting, negotiating, planning common ventures, working them out and achieving them together are deeply rooted in the cultural, human and social background of business people. They are not related to a superficial variance of business customs, and simple “empathy” is not enough for the avoidance of misunderstandings. In fact, people with different cultural backgrounds often do not share the same basic assumptions and this has an influence at several levels of international business negotiations: the behavioral predis-positions of the parties; their concept of what is negotiation and what should be an appropriate negotiation strategy; their attitudes during the negotiation process which may lead to cultural misunderstandings and undermine trust between the parties; differences in outcome orientation. Culture Defined Culture as Learned and Forgotten Norms and Behavioural Patterns Sometimes culture has a reputation for being rather vague, for being a somewhat “blurred” concept. The Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf defines culture as “what remains when that which has been learned is entirely forgotten”. Depicted thus, culture may appear to be a “rubbish-bin” concept. Its main use would be to serve when more precise explanations have proved unsuccessful. It would also serve as an explanatory variable for residuals, when other more operative explanations seem inadequate. Nevertheless, Selma Lagerlöf’s definition does have the important merit of identifying two basic elements of cultural dynamics (at the individual level): (1) It is learned. (2) It is forgotten, in the sense that we cease to be conscious (if we ever have been) of its existence as learned behavior. For example, if one has been told during childhood that modest and self- effacing behavior is suitable when addressing other people, especially at first contact — which is the case in most Asian cultures — one forgets about this and is easily shocked by assertive, apparently boastful, behavior which may appear in other cultures. Although largely forgotten, culture permeates our daily individual and collective actions. It is entirely oriented towards our adaptation to reality (both as constraints and opportunities). Since culture is “forgotten”, it is mostly unconsciously embedded in individual and collective behavior. Individuals find, in their cultural group, pre-set and agreed-upon solutions which indicate to them how to properly articulate their behavior and actions with members of the same cultural group. Basic Definitions of Culture Culture has been defined extensively, precisely because it is somewhat all- encompassing. After having assessed its nature as learned and forgotten, we need to provide some additional definitions of culture. Some authors argue, for instance, that it is shared and transmitted: “A culture is the configuration of learned behavior and results of behavior whose component elements are shared and transmitted by the members of a particular society”. However, we should not go too far in considering the individual as simply programmed by culture. Linton had clearly indicated the limits of the cultural programming which a society can impose on an individual: No matter how carefully the individual has been trained or how successful his conditioning has been, he remains a distinct organism with his own needs and with capacities for independ- ent thought, feeling and action. Moreover he retains a considerable degree of individuality. If individuals have some leeway, then what use is culture to them? Culture is a set of beliefs or standards, shared by a group of people, which help the individual decide what is, what can be, how one feels about it, what to do and how to go about doing it. On the basis of this operational definition of culture, there is no longer any reason why culture should be equated with the whole of one particular society. It may be more related to activities that are shared by a definite group of people. Consequently individuals may share different cultures with several different groups, a corporate culture with colleagues at work, an educational culture with other MBA graduates, an ethnic culture with people of the same ethnic origin. When in a particular situation, they will switch into the culture that is operational. The term “operational”, in this context, implies that a culture must be shared with those with whom there must be co-operation, and that it must be suitable for the task. Goodenough’s concept of “operating culture” assumes that individuals are able to choose the culture within which to interact at a given moment and in a given situation. This is, of course, subject to the overriding condition that this culture has been correctly internalised during past experiences, that it is so well learned that it can be forgotten. Although the concept of operating culture is somewhat debatable, it does have the advantage of clearly highlighting the multicultural nature of many individuals in today’s societies, including binationals, multilingual people and people who have an international professional culture or are influenced as employees by the corporate culture of a multinational company. In this respect, international negotiation between culturally different organizations results in creating a new operating culture, a common set of beliefs and solutions, which is especially the case of joint ventures. Significant Components of Culture Language and communication The way in which people communicate (that is both emit and receive messages) and the extent to which their native language frames their world-views and attitudes directly affects international business negotiations. They require a dialogue, although partners may have different native languages, writing contracts in a foreign language (at least foreign to one side) using interpreters, trying to express ideas, concepts which may be unique in a particular language, etc. Institutional and Legal Systems Differences in legal systems, contractual formalism and recourse to litigation express contrasts in how societies are organized in terms of rules and decision-making systems. The level of formality in addressing public and private issues has to be considered in any kind of negotiated partnership, including the discussion of joint-venture contracts, the registration of subsidiaries and the addressing of sensitive issues with the public authorities of the host country. Value Systems The prevailing values in a particular society, and the extent to which they are respected in the everyday behavior of individuals, are important because they affect the willingness to take risks, the leadership style and the superior-subordinate relationships. This is true for the relationships between negotiators within a particular team, antagonistic negotiation teams and the negotiators on both sides and those from whom they have received the mandate for negotiating. Time Orientations Attitudes towards time and how it shapes the way people structure their actions have a pervasive yet mostly invisible influence. Differences in punctuality, reflected in everyday negotiation behavior, may probably appear as the most visible consequence, but differences in time orientations, especially toward the future, are more important as they affect long-range issues such as the strategic framework of decisions made when negotiating. Mindsets Whether called “Mindsets” (Fisher 1988), “intellectual styles” (Galtung 1981) or “mental models” (Bazerman et al. 2000), another major difference concerns the way people reflect on issues. Do they prefer to rely on data, ideas or speech, and which combination of these? How does this influence the way they relate words and actions? Mindsets influence ways of addressing issues, of collecting information, of choosing the relevant pieces of information and of assessing their “truthfulness”, so that finally they influence the negotiation process and the resulting decisions. Relationship Patterns These concern how the individual relates to the group(s); what the dominant family and kinship patterns are; and how relationships are framed (individualism/collectivism; patronage relationships). These patterns affect international business negotiations through the style of interaction between people, their decision-making process, and the way in which they mix human relationships and business matters. Culture and Negotiation: The Academic Literature A large part of the academic literature on the influence of culture on international business negotiations uses a comparative and cross-cultural setting. A laboratory experiment helps in the comparison of negotiations between people of various nationalities. Nationality is used as a proxy and summary variable for culture. A basic description is made of the cultural traits of a specific nationality in negotiations, which is then contrasted with one or more different national groups. It is the basis for some hypotheses on either the process or the outcome of these negotiations, where the membership of a specific national group is one of the main explanatory variables. It is advisable to be prudent before directly transposing data, on the behavior or negotiation strategies of people from a particular country which have been collected during negotiations with their compatriots. Some traits may not recur when people are negotiating with partners of other nationalities. For instance, when Italians negotiate together, or with the French, they may not adopt exactly the same behavior and strategies as they do when negotiating with Americans. Researchers address the issue of whether these simple international comparisons are fallacies, when and if researchers are trying to describe cross-cultural interactions accurately. They demonstrate that negotiators tend to adapt their behavior in intercultural negotiation. They do not behave as predicted by that which has been observed in intracultural negotiations. Therefore their behaviour as observed in intracultural negotiations can only serve as a partial basis for the prediction of their style and strategies when negotiating with people belonging to different cultures. Graham and Adler, for instance, show that French-speaking Canadians are more problem solving orientated when negotiating with English-speaking Canadians than they normally are among themselves. Hence, the word “intercultural” in this text directly relates to the study of interaction between people with different cultural backgrounds. The word “cross-cultural” relates to a research design that is generally comparative but may also be centered on the encounter/interaction. General Influence of Culture on Business Negotiations Culture has mostly an indirect influence on the outcome of negotiations. It works through two basic groups of mediating variables: the situational aspects of the negotiation (time and time pressure, power and exercise of power, number of participants, location, etc.); and the characteristics of the negotiators (especially personality variables and cultural variables). These two groups of factors, in turn, influence the negotiation process, which ultimately determines the outcome. However, it is my contention that culture also has an influence on the outcome orientation: certain cultures are more deal/contract oriented whereas others favor relationship developments. Behavioral Predispositions of the Parties Who is Seen as a Credible Partner? Scientists emphasize three dimensions of the self-concept which may have a strong influence on the cultural coding/decoding process of credibility: Table 5.1: The impact of cultural differences on international marketing negotiations. 1. Behavioral predispositions of the parties Concept of the self Impact on credibility (in the awareness and exploration phases) Interpersonal orientation Individualism vs. collectivism/ relationship vs. deal orientation In-group orientation Similarity/“Limited good concept” Power orientation Power distance /Roles in negotiation teams/Negotiators’ leeway Willingness to take risks Uncertainty avoidance /Degree of self-reliance of negotiators 2.

Outcome orientations Partnership as outcome Making a new in-group — “marriage” as metaphoric outcome Deal/Contract as outcome Contract rules being the law of the parties (litigation orientation) Profit as outcome Accounting profit orientation (economicity) Winning over the other party Distributive orientation Time line of negotiation Continuous vs. discontinuous view of negotia- tion (1) self-esteem: the extent to which people think of themselves as very good or not too good; (2) perceived potency: the extent to which people view themselves as powerful, able to accomplish almost any task; and (3) perceived activity: the person sees him/herself as a doer, an active shaper of the world. Since people generally live in homogeneous cultural settings (i.e. countries or regions within countries with one language, a dominant religion and shared values) they use the same cultural codes. But when people do not share the same codes, this may create problems for establishing credibility/trust. For example, a credible person may be considered by the emitter (coder) to be somebody showing a low self-concept profile (modest, patiently listening to partners, speaking little and cautiously etc.); if, conversely, the receiver (decoder) considers a credible person as somebody with a high self-concept profile (showing self-confidence, speaking arrogantly, not paying much attention to what the other is saying, etc.) there will be a credibility misunderstanding. A classic example is the misinterpretation by the Soviet leader Khrushchev of the credibility of the American president, John F. Kennedy. It was one of the main reasons for the seriousness of the Cuban missile crisis at the beginning of the 1960s. Kennedy and Khrushchev had held talks in Vienna, after the unsuccessful invasion by U.S. soldiers resulting in defeat at the Bay of Pigs. During their meeting, the young President Kennedy recognised that this attack had been a military and political mistake, which he regretted. Khrushchev saw this confession of error as a testimony of Kennedy’s frank naivety and lack of character. He therefore inferred that it was possible to gain advantage by installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, which would have been targeted at the United States. This led the world to the brink of nuclear war between the superpowers. The events which followed showed that Khrushchev had been wrong in evaluating Kennedy’s credibility. Ultimately, Kennedy showed great firmness and negotiation skill. Khrushchev’s mistake may be explained by differences in cultural coding of credibility. Whereas in the United States, reaching a high position while still young is positively perceived, Soviet people associate age with the ability to carry responsibilities. Moreover, the admission of a mistake or a misjudgement is also positively perceived in the United States. U.S. ethics value frankness and honesty. There is the belief that individuals may improve their behavior and decisions by taking into account the lessons of experience. On the other hand, in the Soviet Union, admission of errors was rare. It generally implied the very weak position of people subjected to the enforced confessions of the Stalinist trials. Lecture 2. The Impact of Culture on International Business Communications Signs of Credibility Personal credibility is decoded through the filter of numerous physical traits, which are not often actively taken into consideration as they seem to be only appearances, or because we tend to use these reference points unconsciously. Being tall may, for instance, be perceived as a sign of strength and character. Stoutness may be considered a positive sign for a partner in societies where starvation is still a recent memory. Where malnutrition is a reality for a section of the population, it is better to be fat, that is, well nourished and therefore rich-and powerful-looking. Naturally these signs have a relative value. Weight, height, age and sex cannot be considered as adequate criteria for selecting negotiators. Furthermore, people may, in fact, be largely aware of the cultural code of the partner. Each of these basic signs plays a role in the initial building of a credibility profile: age, sex, height, stoutness, face, tone and strength of the voice, self- esteem, perceived potency, perceived activity, etc. This profile is a priori because it only influences credibility in early contacts, that is, in the phase of awareness and at the beginning of the exploration phase. Interpersonal Orientation The reproach made to Western business people by the Japanese, quoted in the introduction of this chapter, illustrates differences in interpersonal orientation. The concept of ningensei, presented at the beginning of this chapter has to do with the Confucian ethic which favors smooth interactions, underplaying conflict to the benefit of social harmony. For instance, the interpersonal sensitivity of Japanese people and their sincere interest in foreign cultures and people may make them friendly hosts at business lunches or dinners. As emphasized by researchers, “Before entering serious negotiations, Japanese business men will spend considerable time and money entertaining foreign negotiating teams, in order to get to know their negotiating partners and establish with them a rapport built on friendship and trust”. But it should never be forgotten that Japanese negotiators remain down-to-earth: they are strongly aware of what their basic interests are. Ningensei is, in fact, typical of collectivist values of interpersonal relationships (see Box 5.1). A basic divide in the interpersonal orientation is the individualism/collectivism divide (for a review of its impact on negotiation behavior. Its relevance for international business negotiations is examined in the following chapter. In-group Orientation Equal concern for the other party’s outcome is not necessarily to be found across all cultures. Cultures place a stronger or weaker emphasis on group membership (the other party is/is not a member of the in-group) as a prerequisite for being considered a trustworthy partner. In cultures where there is a clear-cut distinction between the in-group and the out-group (according to age, sex, race or kinship criteria) people tend to perceive the interests of both groups as diametrically opposed. This is related to what has been called the concept of “limited good”. According to the concept of “limited good”, if something positive happens in favor of the out-group, the wealth and well-being of the in-group will be threatened. Such reactions are largely based on culture-based collective subjectivity: they stem from the conservative idea that goods and riches are by their very nature restricted. If one yields to the other party even the tiniest concession, this is perceived as directly reducing what is left for in-group members. The concept of “limited good” induces negotiators to adopt very territorial and distributive strategies. It is a view which clearly favors the idea of the zero sum game, where “I will lose whatever you may win” and vice versa. In Mediterranean and Middle Eastern societies where the in-group is highly valued (clan, tribe, extended family) the concept of “limited good” is often to be found; it slows the adoption of a problem-solving orientation, since co-operative opportunities are simply difficult to envisage. It has been in fact argued that members of collectivist cultures make a sharp distinction between in-groups and out-groups, a reason for that being that harmony enhancement is only viewed as possible with in-group members. However, there is always some free room for negotiating insider/outsider status not only within but also across cultures. Scientists present a number of case studies showing how people can gain status as partial insiders by leveraging common features that transcend the borders of cultures, such as gender or professional cultures. They demonstrate the role of a shared professional culture in blurring the ingroup/outgroup borders in an increasingly globalized world. His findings show that there is no significant impact of cultural differences on the international buyer-seller relationship in the context of the fisheries industries, whether trading partners of Norwegian exporters are Euro- pean or American (more in-group) or Japanese (more out-group). As he points out, “It is not unlikely that industries or trades which are very international will develop a specific industry culture, serving the role of unifying persons and companies from different nations and ethnic groups”. Power Orientation One must distinguish between the formal power orientation on the one hand and the real power/decision-making orientation on the other. The first has to do with the display of status and how it may enhance credibility, especially in high perceived-potency societies. This involves the kind of meetings, societies, clubs, alumni organizations which assemble potentially powerful people. Belonging to such circles gives an opportunity for socializing and getting to know each other. The simple fact of being there and being a member of a certain club is the main credibility message. The signs of formal power orientation differ across cultures; they may range from education and titles (English public schools, French Grandes Ecoles, Herr Doktor, etc.) to belonging to a particular social class or caste. Real power orientation is a somewhat different issue. As illustrated in Box 5.2 with an African example, there may be wide differences between formal and actual influence on the decision-making process. When making contacts, in a cross-cultural perspective, people should be aware of the following: (1) status is not shown in the same way according to culture; (2) influential persons are not the same and individual influence is not exerted in the same way; and (3) the decision-making process differs. Hofstede in his article about the cultural predictors of negotiation styles hypotheses that larger power distance will lead to a more centralized control and decision-making structure because key negotiations have to be concluded by the top authority. And, in fact, a typically high-power distance country (score of 81 on Hoftsede’s scale) one finds a relatively centralized decision-making, based on individuals who have extended responsibility at the top of the organization. They become frustrated when confronted by the Americans who tend to have several negotiators in charge of compartmen-talised issues: In another mismatch of the systems, the Americans find it hard to determine how much Mexican decision-making authority goes with which designated authority. There, as in many of the more traditional systems, authority tends to reside somewhat more in the person than in the position, and an organization chart does little to tell the outsider just what leverage (palanca) the incumbent has. Willingness to Take Risks Negotiation activities are associated with risk-taking. Disclosing information, making concessions or drafting clauses involves risk taking because there is always a certain degree of vulnerability to the other party’s opportunist actions. As shown in scientific literature, cultural differences exist in the perception of risk rather than in the attitudes towards perceived risk. Researchers studied how respondents from China, USA, Germany and Poland, differed in risk preference for risky financial options and found the Chinese to be the less risk averse, with the Poles in the middle, and Germans and Americans showing the highest level of risk aversion. However, they show that attitudes towards perceived risk are shared cross-culturally, that is, people across cultures tend to be consistently willing to pay more for less risky options. What differs is the perception of risk itself. As emphasized, “An understanding of the reasons why members of different groups (for example, different cultures) differ in preference or willingness-to-pay for risky options is crucial if one wants to leverage these differences into creative integrative bargaining solutions in inter-group negotiations”. Risk taking is related to Hoftsede’s cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance which measures the extent to which people in a society tend to feel threatened by uncertain, ambiguous, risky or undefined situations. Where uncertainty avoidance is high, organisations promote stable careers, produce rules and procedures, etc. “Nevertheless societies in which uncertainty avoidance is strong are also characterized by a higher level of anxiety and aggressiveness that creates, among other things, a strong inner urge to work hard”. Hofstede points out that “uncertainty avoidance should not be confused with risk avoidance . . . even more than reducing risk, uncertainty avoidance leads to a reduction of ambiguity” . A high level of uncertainty-avoidance is noted by Hoftsede as being associated with a more bureaucratic functioning and a lower tendency for individuals to take risks. This may be a problem for business negotiators when they have received a mandate from top management. For instance, the bureaucratic orientation in ex-communist countries has imposed strong government control on industry. As a consequence, Chinese negotiators, for instance, tend not to be capable of individual decision-making. Before any agreement is reached, official government approval must be sought by Chinese negotiators. The same has been noted by Beliaev, in the case of Russian negotiators: “Throughout the process, a series of ministries are involved . . . Such a process also limits the degree of risk taking that is possible . . . the American who does see it from (the Soviet) perspective may well interpret it as being slow, lacking in initiative and unproductive”. Another researcher confirms this tendency in the case of Chinese executives who tend to consult their superior significantly more than Canadian executives who belong to a low uncertainty-avoidance society. Lecture 3. Underlying Concepts of Negotiations and Negotiation Strategies: Cultural Aspects Integrative Orientation vs. Distribution Orientation In business negotiations, the purchaser (or team of purchasers) and the vendor (or group of vendors) are mutually interdependent, and their individual interests clash. The ability to choose effective negotiation largely explains the individual performance of each party on the one hand, and the joint outcome on the other. In pitting themselves against each other, the parties may develop opposing points of view towards the negotiation strategy which they intend to adopt: distributive or integrative. In the distributive strategy (or orientation) the negotiation process is seen as leading to the division of a specific “cake” which the parties feel they cannot enlarge even if they were willing to do so. This orientation is also termed “competitive negotiation” or “zero sum game”. It leads to a perception of negotiation as a war of positions — territorial in essence. These are negotiations of the “win-lose” type — “anything that isn’t yours is mine” and vice versa. The negotiators hold attitudes and objectives that are quasi-conflictive. Interdependence is minimized whereas opposition is emphasized. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the integrative orientation. The central assumption is that the size of the “cake”, the joint outcome of the negotiations, can be increased if the parties adopt a co-operative attitude. This idea is directly linked to problem-solving orientation. Negotiators may not be concerned purely with their own objectives, but may also be interested in the other party’s aspirations and results, seeing them as almost equally important. Integrative orientation has been termed “co- operative” or “collaborative”. It results in negotiation being seen as an attempt to maximize the joint outcome. The division of this outcome is to a certain extent secondary or is at least perceived as an important but later issue. Here negotiation is a “positive sum game” where the joint outcome is greater than zero. In practice, effective negotiation combines distributive and integrative orientations simultaneously, or at different stages in the negotiation process. The “dual concern model” explains negotiation strategies according to two basic variables: concern for one’s own outcome (horizontal axis) and concern for the other party’s outcome (vertical axis). This leads to four possible strategies (see Table 5.2). According to this model, the ability to envisage the other party’s outcome is a prerequisite for the adoption of an integrative strategy. Problem-solving orientation can be defined as an overall negotiating behavior that is co-operative, integrative and orientated towards the exchange of information. Fair communication and the Table 5.2: The dual concern model. Concern for one’s own outcomes Concern for the other party’s outcomes ⇓ Low High High Yielding Integrative strategy Low Inaction Contending exchange of information between negotiators are important. “Problem solvers” exchange representative information, that is, honest and objective data. There is no desire to manipulate the partner, as in instrumental communication. Exchanging representative information is con- sidered a basic element in problem-solving orientation. Empirical studies (experimental negotiation stimulation) have shown that this orientation positively influences the common results of negotiation. Rubin & Carter, for instance, demonstrate the general superiority of co-operative negotiation by developing a model whereby a new, more co-operative contract provides both the buyer and the seller with cost reduction, compared to a previous adversarial contract. There are, however, some conditions; the first is the availability of cost- related data, the second is the release of this data to the other party during negotiation. The sharing of data is obviously conditioned by culture, language and communication-related issues. The adoption of an integrative strategy is facilitated by the following: (1) a high level of aspirations on both sides; (2) the ability to envisage the future; (3) the existence of a sufficient “perceived common ground”, that is, enough overlap between the interests of the two parties. Cultural Dispositions to Being Integrative Even though one may accept the superior effectiveness of integrative strategies, in as far as they aim to maximise the joint outcome, the problem of how this joint outcome is divided between the two sides remains largely unaddressed. When integrating the cultural dimension, three questions merit consideration: (1) Do the parties tend to perceive negotiations as being easier, and do they tend to adopt an integrative orientation more readily, when they both share the same culture? (2) Do negotiators originating from particular cultures tend towards an integrative or distributive orientation? Furthermore, do negotiators origi- nating from cultures which favor a problem-solving orientation risk seeing their personal results heavily diminished by a distributive partner who cynically exploits their good will? (3) Do cultural differences and intercultural negotiation reduce the likelihood of integrative strategy? Difficulties in Being Integrative in an Intercultural Negotiation Situation Generally, speaking, it seems more difficult to pursue an integrative strategy in an intercultural than intracultural setting. Nationalistic feelings are easily aroused by conflicts of interest and the partner may easily be subjectively perceived as an “adversary”, occupying a different and rival territory. These negative feelings are often reinforced by an alleged atmosphere of “economic war” which, for instance, results in “Japan bashing” in the United States where the Japanese are considered to be unfair competitors. According to this view, a potential partner belonging to another country-culture would also be perceived as a global adversary. There is general agreement in the existing literature that the results of negotiation are less favorable when the negotiation is intercultural as opposed to intracultural, all other things being equal. Van Zandt suggests that the negotiations between Americans and the Japanese are six times as long and three times as difficult as those exclusively between Americans. This increases the costs of the transaction for the American firms in Japan owing to the relative inefficiency of communication. Other researchers show that intercultural U.S.-Japanese negotiations result in significantly lower joint gains than intracultural U.S. or Japanese negotiations (in which both national groups achieve similar joint gains). It seems that an explanation is that intercultural negotiators lack sufficient skills to adapt successfully and need a lot more clarifying statements than do intracultural negotiators. Another possible explanation is that American negotiators tend to use harder tactics, engaging in threats, demands and sanctions when there is more cultural distance with their partners’ culture . The subjective satisfaction of the negotiators (measured by a questionnaire) in their result tends to be inferior for intercultural negotiation compared to intracultural negotiation. However, recent empirical findings have disconfirmed this. In Brett & Okumura intercultural negotiators were more happy and satisfied with the negotiation than were intracultural negotiators. This can be explained either by the subjective reward effect of achieving an obviously more difficult negotiation task (i.e. inter- as compared with intracultural negotiation) or by people being satisfied in both cultural groups by different — and not competing — outcomes (joint gains for Americans vs. outcome parity for the Chinese). Problem-solving depends on a collaborative attitude which is easier with a partner from the same culture. Negotiation partners’ similarity, lead to more trust and an enhanced level of interpersonal attraction. A greater similarity between two parties will induce greater interpersonal attraction. People need to evaluate others before entering into interaction: similarity facilitates accurate appraisal in the process of social comparison. As a result of similarity, each side tends to consider communication from the other as more representative, more honest and truthful. In other words, one party perceives that it transmits fairly objective information and does not try to unduly influence the other party, as is the case with instrumental communication. The hypothesis that the similarity of the parties leads to a more favorable outcome was proposed by Evans. Similarity facilitates awareness and exploration between parties. In fact, it is more a question of perceived similarity which leads to more cooperative behavior in negotiation. If this similarity is perceived but not based on strictly objective indications (such as shared nationality, language or educational backgrounds) a dissymmetric view of similarity may arise between the buyer and seller. For instance, many business people in the Middle East have a good command of either the English or French language and culture. Middle Eastern business people are often perceived by their American or European counterparts as being similar, whereas they may perceive their Western counterparts as different. The role adopted in negotiation, buyer or seller, combines with perceived similarity. If sellers perceive a greater similarity, this can lead to a stronger problem-solving orientation on their part. Although appealing, similarity-based hypotheses have been poorly validated by the empirical study. No significant relationship was found among American and British buyer/seller pairs: similarity did not favor problem-solving orientation. In the case of the French and the Germans, the perceived similarity only led to a stronger problem-solving orientation on the part of the seller. However, the actual dissimilarity between negotiators was strongly reduced by the fact that all the simulated negotiations were intracultural. In intercultural terms, there is the possibility of a misunderstanding arising from a perception of similarity which is not shared by both parties. For example, one can imagine a situation where a seller (American, for instance) perceives the buyer as similar (an Arab buyer who is very Westernized in appearance, who has a superficial but misleading cultural outlook because of his cultural borrowing). However, the reverse situation does not occur; the Arab buyer is aware that the American seller knows little about the Arabic culture. In this case the seller will have a tendency to take a problem-solving orientation, because of fallacious perceived similarity, whereas the buyer may exploit the seller without feeling obliged to reciprocate, and ultimately maximize his personal outcome by adopting a distributive strategy. However, the dynamics of similarity (showing to the other side that one understands, and thus laying the foundation for an integrative attitude on both sides) can be reversed, more positively. Harris & Moran cite the case of a U.S. banker from the Midwest invited by an Arab sheik for a meeting in London. The banker demonstrates unusual patience and deep awareness of the other party’s power. The banker arrives in London and waits to meet the sheik. After two days he is told to fly to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, which he does. He waits. After three days in Riyadh, he meets the sheik and the beginning of what was to become a very beneficial business relationship between the two persons and their organizations began. National Orientations Favoring the Integrative Strategy The second question concerns the adoption of integrative strategies by some nationalities more than others. Studies tend to show that American business people show trust more willingly and more spontaneously than other cultural groups, and have a stronger tendency towards a problem-solving and integrative orientation. The level of their profits as sellers depends on the buyer responding positively by also adopting a problem- solving approach. American negotiators have a stronger tendency to exchange representative communication, making clear and explicit messages a priority. This is in line with the American appreciation of frankness and directness and their explicit communication style according to Hall. This is what is called the “John Wayne Style”. They often meet certain difficulties with cultures who take more time in the preliminaries, getting to know each other, that is, talking generally and only actually getting down to business later. As a result, Americans may not foster feelings of trust in negotiators from other cultural groups who feel it necessary to get to know the person they are dealing with. Graham & Meissner have shown, in a study comparing five countries, that the most integrative strategies are adopted by the Brazilians, followed by the Japanese. On the other hand, the Americans, the Germans and the Koreans choose intermediate strategies that are more distributive. This is consistent in the case of the Germans who use the hard-sell approach, where the seller is fairly pushy and adopts an instrumental communication and a distributive strategy. The concept of integrative strategy is strongly influenced by the American tradition of experimental research in social psychology applied to commercial negotiation. As explained by Leung, “In individualist societies, negotiation is seen more as a task than as a social process. The primary role of negotiators is to work out a solution that is acceptable to both sides”. It is also based on a “master of destiny” orientation which feeds attitudes of problem resolution. As noted, the problem-solving approach appears to make sense to the American negotiators, but this framework may not work in all cases when applied to foreign negotiators. Americans tend to see the world as consisting of problems to be solved, whereas Arabs, for instance, see it more as a creation of God. However, to our knowledge, there is no empirical study that has shown, for example, that the Arabs from the Middle East have a tendency to be more distributive and or less problem-solving oriented than the Americans. A key issue in the integrative approach is wether parties should primarily strive for achieving a maximum joint gain or for reaching outcome parity between negotiators. Scientists show that American negotiators consider problem solving as a more adequate strategy and are more satisfied with joint gain maximization than Hong Kong negotiators. When presented with cooperative instructions, Hong Kong negotiators tend to interpret them as meaning that they should strive for equality and display more satisfaction than Americans when the goal of outcome parity is reached. The tendency to search for equality in outcomes and to share the burden by allocating resources equally is confirmed in the case of Japanese as compared to American negotiators. The dilemma about maximizing joint gains vs. outcome parity is precisely where the “double-bind” situation in negotiation is at its peak and where cultures offer simplified, pre-framed solutions to the paradox of having to cooperate at the risk of being taken advantage of. As emphasized, cross-cultural negotiation research has provided data “consistent with the generalization that members of individualist cultures are more likely to handle conflicts directly through competition and problem solving, whereas members of collectivist cultures are more likely to handle conflict in indirect ways that attempt to preserve the relationship”. Leung explains that “disintegration avoidance” (DA) is at the very heart of Chinese negotiation behavior; as long as there is reason for maintaining the relationship, DA will result in a preference for conflict avoidance. However, when the conflict is perceived as caused by the other party’s misbehaviour, DA ceases to be effective and Chinese negotiators are more likely to recommend discontinuing the negotiation. Ignorance of the Other Party’s Culture as an Obstacle to the Implementation of an Integrative Strategy in Negotiation One of the most important obstacles to effective international business negotiation is the ignorance of all or at least the basics of the other party’s culture. This is intellectually obvious, but is often forgotten by international negotiators. It refers not only to the cognitive ignorance of the main traits of the other party’s culture, but also to the unconscious prejudice that differences are minor (that is, ignorance as absence of awareness). This favors the natural tendency to refer implicitly to one’s own cultural norms, especially for the coding/decoding process of communication (the self reference criterion). In the case of business negotiations between American and Chinese people for U.S.-Japanese business negotiations, note the relative lack of prior knowledge of the American negotiators about their partner’s culture. Before coming to the negotiation table, Americans do not generally read books, nor do they train themselves for the foreign communication style, nor learn about the potential traps which could lead to misunderstandings. As Carlos Fuentes states (in a rather harsh aphorism), “What the U.S. does best is understand itself. What it does worst is understand others”. French negotiators also tend to be underprepared in terms of cultural knowledge whereas the Japanese seemingly try to learn a lot more than the French or the Americans about the other party’s culture before negotiation takes place. The negotiation and implementation (which often means ongoing negotia- tions) of a joint venture may last for several years. In this case, national cultures tend to disappear as the two teams partly merge their values and behaviour in a common “venture culture”. In order to improve intercultural negotiation effectiveness, it is advisable to build this common culture between the partners/ adversaries right from the start of the negotiations. It means establishing common rules, communication codes, finding people on each side who will act as go-betweens and trying to agree on a common interpretation of issue, facts, solutions and decision-making. This must not be considered as a formal process; it is informal and built on implicit communications. Furthermore, it relies heavily on those individuals who have been involved in the joint venture over a long period of time and who get on well together. Lecture 3. Cultural Misunderstandings in the Business Negotiations Process If future partners do not share common “mental schemes”, it could be difficult for them to solve problems together. Buyer and seller should share some joint views of the world, especially on the following questions: What is the relevant information? How should this information be sought, evaluated and fed into the decision-making process? An important distinction in the field of cross-cultural psychology opposes idealism to pragmatism. As indicated, “Idealism vs. pragmatism, which corresponds to Glenn’s universalism vs. particularism, refers to the extent to which the information extracted from the environment is transmitted within a broad framework, such as a religion or a political ideology, or a relatively narrow framework”. This dimension refers to a way of thinking, an important element of the “mindset”. Ways of Processing Information: Is there a Common Rationality Between Partners? People differ in their ways of relating thinking to action: while the ideologists tend to think broadly and relate to general principles, the pragamatist orientation concentrates on focusing on detailed issues that are to be solved one by one. Pragmatists will prefer to negotiate specific clauses, in sequential manner. Conversely, ideologists see arguments in favour of their “global way of thinking”, when negotiating a large contract, such as a nuclear plant or a television satellite for instance: it is a unitary production, it is a complex multi-partner business, it often involves government financing and also has far-reaching social, economic and political consequences. Pragmatists will also find many arguments in favor of their way of thinking: the technicalities of the plant and its desired performance require an achievement and deadline orientation (pragmatist values). Triandis hypothesises that complex traditional societies will tend to be ideologist ones, whereas pluralistic societies or cultures experiencing rapid social change will tend to be pragmatist. This distinction may also be traced back to the difference between the legal systems of common law (mainly English and American) and the legal system of code law. Whereas the former one favours legal precedents set by the courts and past rulings (cases) the latter favors laws and general texts. These general provisions are intended to build an all-inclusive system of written rules of law (code). Codes aim to formulate general principles so as to embody the entire set of particular cases. The ideologist orientation, which is to be found mostly in Southern and Eastern Europe, leads the negotiators to try and set principles before any detailed discussion of specific clauses of the contract. Ideologists have a tendency to prefer and promote globalised negotiations in which all the issues are gathered in a “package deal”. The pragmatist attitude corresponds more to attitudes found in Northern Europe and the United States. It entails defining limited scope problems, then solving them one after the other. Pragmatists concentrate their thinking on factual aspects (deeds, not words; evidence, not opinions; figures, not value judgements). They are willing to reach real world decisions, even if they have to be down to earth ones. Ideologists will use a wide body of ideas which provide them with a formal and coherent description of the world, Marxism or Liberalism for instance. Every event is supposed to carry meaning when it is seen through this ideologist framework. On the other hand, the pragmatist attitude first considers the extreme diversity of real world situations, and then derives its principles inductively. Reality will be seen as a series of rather independent and concrete problems to be solved (“issues”). These issues will make complete sense when related to practical, precise and even down-to-earth decisions. Typically, ideologists will take decisions (prendre des décisions) that is, pick a solution from a range of possible decisions (which are located outside the decision maker). Conversely, pragmatists will make decisions, that is, both decide and implement: decisions will be enacted, not selected. Box 5.4 illustrates how the pragmatist Americans can resent the ideologist French in international negotiations. Communication may be difficult when partners do not share the same mindset. The most unlikely situation for success is an ideology-orientated contractor/supplier who tries to sell to a pragmatism-orientated owner/buyer. The ideologist will see the pragmatist as being too interested in trivial details, too practical, too down-to-earth, too much data-oriented and incapable of looking at issues from a higher standpoint. Pragmatists will resent ideologists for being too theoretical, lacking practical sense, concerned with issues that are too broad to lead to implementable decisions. In the first steps of the negotiation process, differences between ideologists and pragmatists may create communication misunderstandings which will be difficult to overcome during subsequent phases. Indeed, developing common norms will be fairly difficult, although it is necessary if partners want to be able to predict the other party’s behavior. A frequent comment in such situations will be: “One never knows what these people have in mind; their behavior is largely unpredictable”. An American (pragmatism-orientated) describes negotiations with the French (more ideology-orientated) in the following terms: “The French are extremely difficult to negotiate with. Often they will not accept facts, no matter how convincing they may be”. Argument in Negotiation: Data, Theory, Speech and Virtue Scientists contrast what is called the “intellectual styles” of four important cultural groups: the “Gallic” (prototype: the French), the “Teutonic” (prototype: the Germans), the “Saxonic” (prototype: the English and the Americans) and the “Nipponic” intellectual style (prototype: the Japanese). Saxons prefer to look for facts and evidence which results in factual accuracy and abundance. They are interested in “hard facts” and proofs, and do not like what they call “unsupported statements”. As Galtung states when he describes the intellectual style of Anglo-Americans, “. . . data unite, theories divide. There are clear, relatively explicit canons for establishing what constitutes a valid fact and what does not; the corresponding canons in connection with theories are more vague . . .. One might now complete the picture of the Saxonic intellectual style by emphasizing its weak point: not very strong on theory formation, and not on paradigm awareness”. Galtung contrasts the Saxonic style with the Teutonic and Gallic styles, which place theoretical arguments at the centre of their intellectual process. Data and facts are there to illustrate what is said rather than to demonstrate it. “Discrepancy between theory and data would be handled at the expense of data: they may either be seen as atypical or wholly erroneous, or more significantly as not really pertinent to the theory. And here the distinction between empirical and potential reality comes in: to the Teutonic and Gallic intellectual, potential reality may be not so much the reality to be even more avoided or even more pursued than the empirical one but rather a more real reality, free from the noise and impurities of empirical reality” . However, Teutonic and Gallic intellectual styles do differ in the role that is assigned to words and discourse. The Teutonic ideal is that of the ineluctability of true reasoning Gedankennotwendigkeit, that is, perfection of concepts and the indisputability of their mental articulation. The Gallic style is less preoccupied with deduction and intellectual construction. It is directed more towards the use of the persuasive strength of words and speeches in an aesthetically perfect way (élégance). Words have an inherent power to convince. They may create potential reality, thus probably the often-noted Latin love of words. Finally the Nipponic intellectual style, imbued with Hindu, Buddhist and Taoist philosophies, favors a more modest, global and provisional approach. Thinking and knowledge are conceived of as being in a temporary state, open to alteration. The Japanese “rarely pronounce absolute, categorical statements in daily discourse; they prefer vagueness even about trivial matters . . . because clear statements have a ring of immodesty, of being judgements of reality” . Communication and Language Needless to remark that the cross-cultural communication processes are a key component of the influence of culture on international marketing negotiations. If negotiators want to promote an integrative approach, it is important for them to focus on sharing and seeking information. Communication has been shown to generate greater cooperation even among negotiation partners that display strong tendencies to self-interest. The language used for negotiation has its importance: the myth that any language can be translated into another language often causes English to be chosen as a central negotiation language and to add interpreters when proficiency is too low on one side. As emphasized, in the case of Sino-Foreign joint ventures, few Chinese can speak a foreign language and all oral communication between the Chinese and their foreign partners has to pass through interpreters, “When a third person is involved no genuine, direct communication between two persons can take place. In other words, “heart-to- heart” talks are unlikely to take place”. Furthermore, due to poor translation, it may be that only 30–40% of the actual content of what is said in Chinese is conveyed to the non-Chinese speaking negotiation partners, resulting in the discarding of good ideas and suggestions made by the Chinese . Researchers give a detailed account of how language used is negotiated in the case of a German-Japanese joint venture. “The negotiated outcome for language use [English as official venture language] was really the only one available. When a Japanese or German was confused or needed help, they would confer with members of their same cultural group in their mother tongue. This was done solely to expedite matters and clarify issues rather than as a means of excluding one or the other group from decision-making. One German manager spoke this way of the negotiation outcome: ‘The work language is English. But, during discussion, they would sometimes speak Japanese and I thought this was a good thing because you know your own language better and can understand better and can discuss things more precisely. One has to be tolerant . . .’”. There are semantic differences in the words used and many misunderstand- ings can arise from ignoring the precise meaning of key concepts for the negotiation; an economist gives the example of noticeable differences in the use of the word “customer” by Japanese and American negotiators. She shows that cultural connotations is a crucial aspect of conversation which needs careful attention in understanding the meaning beyond the mere one-to-one translations of words. Moreover, speakers of certain languages (i.e. high context languages such as Japanese, Chinese or Arabic) use more contextual cues to decode messages. When messages are exchanged, the degree to which they should be interpreted has to be taken into account as well as the cross-cultural differences in linguistic styles, involving the use of silence or conversational overlaps . For instance, silence is a full form of communication for the Japanese, and Graham reports twice as much silence in Japanese interaction than in American. Westerners often have the impression that they “do all the talking”. Low-context negotiators, such as Americans, tend to be explicit, precise, legalistic and direct in communication, sometimes forceful and even appearing as blunt to the other party (USIP 2002). In a recent empirical survey of Japanese and U.S. negotiators, researchers show that direct and indirect communication patterns are consistent with Hall’s theory of low- vs. high- context communication: The U.S. negotiators relied on direct information to learn about each other’s preferences and priorities and to integrate this information to generate joint gains. They were comfortable sharing information about priorities, comparing and contrasting their preferences with those of the other party, and giving specific feedback to offers and proposals. The Japanese negotiators relied on indirect information, inferring each other’s preferences and priorities from multiple offers and counteroffers over time. In fact, the capacity to cope with very different communication styles is a key to successful international business negotiation. This is especially true for non- verbal communication. For instance, a lack of eye contact for the Americans is a signal that something is amiss and “American executives reported that the lack of eye contact was not only disconcerting but reduced their bargaining performance”. Negotiators must be ready to hear true as well as false information, discourse based on facts as well as on wishful thinking or pure obedience to superiors. Frankness and sincerity are culturally relative values, they can be interpreted as mere naivety, a lack of realism or a lack of self-control in speaking one’s own mind. Furthermore, waiting for reciprocation when disclosing useful informa- tion for the other party, makes little sense in an intercultural context. Frankness and directness in communication are a substantial value to the Americans and to a lesser extent to the French, but not to Mexicans in formal encounters, nor to Japanese at any time. The issue of formality vs. informality is a difficult one. Frequently, a contrast is made between cultures which value informality (e.g. American) and those which are more formal (most cultures which have long historical roots and high power distance). “Informality” may be simply another kind of formalism, and the “icebreaking” at the beginning of any typical U.S. meeting between unknown people is generally an expected ritual. It is more important to try and understand what kind of formality is required in which circumstances with which people. Outside of formal negotiation sessions, people belonging to apparently quite formal cultures can become much more informal. Due to increased global communication through the Internet and the extensive use of computer-mediated communication, in particular E-mail, as well as to the rise of Business-to-Business marketplaces, there is an increasing use of global electronic media in negotiating international deals.2 Contrary to traditional negotiation which is assumed to be carried out almost exclusively via face-to-face communication, E-mail does not offer much of the non-verbal feedback which exists in other media. However, electronic communication is very useful for dispersed negotiations, when matters have to be discussed without incurring the high costs associated with face-to-face cross-border negotiation. Potter & Balthazard show that both Chinese and American managers prefer face-to-face over computer-mediated negotiation. However, both Chinese and Americans, negotiating intraculturally, do not perceive a significant difference between E-mail based written negotiation and the same negotiation dealt with a web-based threaded discussion even though the latter method seems to allow for more continuous interaction. Ulijn based on a study involving 20 participants, use speech act theory and psycholinguistic analysis to show that culture affects non face-to-face communication as is the case of negotiation through E-mail. Scientists also find a number of cultural differences between managers from Austria, Ecuador, Finland and Switzerland who negotiate electronically. Finally E-mail communication is often mixed with face-to-face encounters; E-mailing is widely affected by prior personal acquaintance of the people involved: if negotiators have started with some face-to-face activity, computer- mediated negotiation will be largely facilitated and communication misunderstandings arising from the « dry style » of E-mails may largely be avoided. Negotiation Tactics Graham studied the negotiation tactics used in eight cultures, using videotaped negotiations in which statements were classified into twelve categories. His results show very similar negotiation tactics across cultures, most of them using a majority of tactics based on an exchange of information, either by self-disclosure or questions (more than 50% in all cases). The Chinese score the highest in posing questions, which is consistent with Pye’s comments about them: “Once negotiations begin the Chinese seem passive. They simply ask questions, probe for information, and conceal any eagerness they may feel”. On the other hand, the Spaniards score the highest in making promises. The proportion of “negative” tactics, including threats, warnings, punishment and negative normative appeal (a statement in which the source indicates that the target’s behavior is in violation of social norms) is fairly low in all cases, never exceeding 10% of the information exchange. Finally, cross-national differences are not great at the level of the type of tactics used, nor at the level of their frequency, but are more significant at the level of how they are implemented. The use of theatricality, withdrawal threats and tactics based on time, such as waiting for the last moment to obtain further concessions by making new demands, are based on national styles of negotiations. Tactics are also related to the ambiguous atmosphere of business negotiations when implied warm human relations are supposed to be mixed with business. This relates to the divide between affective and neutral cultures . Negotiations are always interspersed with friendship and enmity, based on personal as well as cultural reasons. Atmosphere can be considered as a central issue in the negotiation process. Researchers posit atmosphere as being of basic importance to the development of the negotiation process. Atmosphere has a double role, as a bearer of the history of the relationship and as main factor explaining the transition from one stage to the next. Atmosphere is characterized in a number of respects, namely the dynamics of conflict and cooperation, reducing or overcoming the distance between the partners, the power/dependence relation and, lastly, the expectations of the parties concerning future deals. Lecture 4. Cultural Differences in International Business Communications Emotions and Conflict-Handling Styles in Cross-Cultural Negotiations Communication misunderstandings in intercultural negotiation quite often result in increased level of emotions, that is, negotiators tend to depart from the rational and objective evaluation of issues at stake and to mix subjectivity and feelings with business matters. Morris outlines two types of misunderstandings that frequently arise between Asian and American negotia- tors: “In one type of misunderstanding, U.S. managers make the error of reading silence of their Asian counterpart as an indication of consent . . . A different type of misunderstanding occurs when Asian managers make the error of reading an U.S. colleague’s direct adversarial arguments as indicating unreasonableness and lack of respect”. Emotions such as anger result in negotiators being less accurate in judging the interests at stake, more self- centered on their own interests; they also have a general effect of reducing joint gains. Kumar makes a sharp distinction between positive and negative emotions in negotiation. Emotions contain both an element of affect and an accompanying physiological arousal. For him, positive emotions result in being more flexible in negotiations, as well as helping negotiators to be more persistent, especially since a positive affective state increases the confidence level of negotiators. However, a positive affective state may also heighten expectations and result in negotiators’ disappointment with actual outcomes. Negative emotions, on the other hand, may result in conflict escalation, that is, actors take matters personally when they should see them with a more distanced attitude. Likely consequences are the attribution to the other side of the responsibility for conflict, and possibly the discontinuation of the relation. While negative emotions may serve to inform the parties that an existing situation is untenable, they may also be snowballing and result in a negative conflict spiral. Negative spirals are partly based on selectively choosing those information cues which will confirm the negative feelings of a negotiators leading her/him to an escalation of negative feelings toward the other party which are no more based on hard facts. They also result from systemic reciprocation of contentious communication. Negative spirals are particularly likely to occur in cross-cultural negotiations due to differences at three levels: differences in internalised values and norms, differences in emotional expression and differences in linguistic styles. A conflict spiral appears as circular as it is based on repeated contentious communication whereby each side “responds” to the other side contentious communication by negative reciprocation. The way to solve problems of negative spirals in negotiation has to do with both models of conflict resolution and with strategic communication styles in negotiation which may help to manage discrepancies in process and outcomes of negotiation. Tinsley shows that the Japanese, the Americans and the Germans use different models of conflict resolution. The Japanese tend to use what she calls the “status model”, that is, social interaction is viewed as governed by status and parties might solicit the advice of higher status Figures to solve the conflict. The German display a preference for the “regulations” model whereby conflict is seen as to be solved by applying standardized, universal and impersonal rules. Finally, Americans prefer the “interest” model whereby parties exchange information on their interests, try to prioritize them and trade off interests. Another dimension of conflict resolution is whether people tend to avoid or to directly confront conflict. Morris show that Chinese managers tend to display conflict avoidance whereas Americans tend to develop a competing style. Moreover, negotiators who come from more traditional societies, where the dimension of social conservatism is high, tend to be more conflict averse. Monitoring emotions in negotiation has to do with the avoidance of negative spirals but also with the avoidance of being too systematically conflict avoidant. A number of communication strategies have been recommended for breaking negative spirals in cross-cultural negotiations. George recommends that negotiators engage in what they call “motivated information processing”, that is, a process whereby information is selectively processed in ways that are supportive of motivational goals; motivation for certain outcomes, rather than affect, guides interpretation. Brett shows that a mix of reciprocation combined with non contentious communication is likely to help breaking negative spirals in negotiations. Differences in Outcome Orientation: Oral versus Written Agreements It would be naïve to believe that profits, especially future accounting profits for each party, are the only possible outcome of the negotiation process. Other possible outcomes are listed in Table 5.1. The main reason for profits not being the sole possible outcome is that they are not really foreseeable. Basic differences in outcome orientation are generally hidden from the negotiation partners, generating increased misunderstandings. Another reason is that many cultures are relationship- rather than deal-oriented. As is described by the scientists, in the case of the Japanese and in the case of the Chinese, they prefer a gentleman’s agreement, a loosely-worded statement expressing mutual cooperation and trust between the parties, to a formal Western-style contract. The most crucial element of preparation for a negotiation with the Japanese is drafting an opening statement which seals the start of a relationship, in which the Western side may have the opportunity to seize the moment and set the tone for the rest of the negotiation. Asymmetry in the Perceived Degree of Agreement Agreements are generally considered as being mostly written. They are achieved by negotiation and by the signing of written contracts, which are often considered “the law of the parties”. This is unfortunately not always true. Keegan points out that for some cultures “my word is my bond” and trust is a personal matter, which he contrasts with the “get-it-in-writing” mentality where trust is more impersonal. The former is typical of the Middle East, whereas the latter is to be found in the United States where hundreds of thousands of lawyers help people negotiate written agreements and litigate within the framework of these written agreements. This has to be interpreted. It does not mean that people rely entirely on either an oral base (oaths, confidence between people, membership of a common group where perjury is considered a crime) or a written base. Exploring, maintaining and checking the bases for trust is a more complex process. It entails various possibilities: (1) An agreement may be non-symmetrical. A agrees with B, but B does not agree with A. Various reasons may explain this situation: either B wishes to conceal the disagreement or there is some sort of misunderstanding, usually language-based. (2) People agree, but on different bases, and they do not perceive the divergence. They have, for instance, quite different interpretations of a clause or some kind of non-written agreement. Although much may be written down, some things will always remain unwritten. What is unwritten may, to one party, seem obviously in line with a written clause, but not to the other. Moreover, if there is no opportunity to confront their interpretations, they cannot be aware of their divergent nature. (3) The agreement is not understood by both parties as having the same degree of influence on: • stability; • precision and explicitness of the exchange relation. Any business activity, particularly business communications presupposes signing a contract. This means that besides oral intercourse there is a written part in business negotiations, which is, of course, also discussed. Written documents are important as they are the material result of business negotiations. That is why it is necessary to pay special attention to them with regard to business issues and cultural aspects. Written Documents as a Basis for Mutual Trust Between the Parties There is a fundamental dialectic in written agreements between distrust and confidence. At the beginning there is distrust. It is implicitly assumed that such distrust is natural. This has to be reduced in order to establish confidence. Trust is not achieved on a global and personal basis but only by breaking down potential distrust in concrete situations where it may hamper common action. Trust is built step by step, with a view towards the future. Therefore real trust is achieved only gradually. Trust is deprived of its personal aspects. Thanks to the written agreement, the parties may trust each other in business, although they do not trust each other as people. Trust is taken to its highest point when the parties sign a written agreement. On the other hand, cultures that favor oral agreements tend not to hypothesise that trust is constructed by the negotiation process. They see trust more as a prerequisite to the negotiation of written agreements. Naturally, they do not expect this prerequisite to be met in every case. Trust tends to be mostly personal. Establishing trust requires that people know each other. That is probably why many Far Eastern cultures need to make informal contacts, discuss general topics and spend time together before they get to the point, even though all this may not appear task-related. Subsequently, the negotiation process will be lengthy because another dialectic is at work. Since people are supposed to trust each other, the negotiation process should not damage or destroy the basic asset of their exchange relationship — trust. They will avoid direct confrontation on a specific clause, and therefore globalise the negotiation process. Global friends may be local foes, provided trust as the basic asset of the negotiation process is not lost. The Ambiguity of the Cultural Status of Written Materials That one should always “get-it-in-writing” is not self-evident. The contrary idea may even impose itself (“if they want it written down, it means that they don’t trust me”). Regina Traoré Sérié explains, for instance, the respective roles of oral communication (spoken, transmitted through personal and concrete communication, passed through generations by storytellers) and written materials (read, industrially printed, impersonally transmitted, with no concrete communication) in the African culture. Reading is an individual act, which does not easily incorporate itself into African culture. Written documents are presented as either irrelevant to everyday social practices, or as an anti-social practice. This is because someone who reads, is also isolating himself, which is resented by the other members of the community. But at the same time, people find books attractive, because they are the symbol of access to a certain kind of power. By reading, people appropriate foreign culture, they get to know “the paper of the whites”. As a consequence, reading is coded as a positive activity in the collective ideal of Ivory Coast society, since it is a synonym for social success. This contradiction between “alien” and “fetish” written documents encapsulates the ambiguity of the status of books in African society. Do Written Contracts and the Intervention of Lawyers Produce Irreversible Commitments? In cultures where relationships are very personalized, confidence cannot be separated from the person in whom the confidence is placed. The basis for mutual trust is no longer the detailed written contractual documents, but a man’s word, which is his bond. It is not “just any word”, but a special kind of word, which is heavily imbued with cultural codes. These words as bonds cannot easily be transferred from one culture to another. Adler describes the case of an Egyptian executive who, after entertaining his Canadian guest, offered him joint partnership in a business venture. The Canadian was very keen to enter this venture with the Egyptian businessman. He therefore suggested that they meet again the next morning with their respective lawyers to fill in the details. The Egyptians never arrived. The Canadian businessman wondered whether this was caused by the lack of punctuality of the Egyptians, or by the Egyptian expecting a counteroffer, or even the absence of available lawyers in Cairo. Adler explains: None of these explanations was true, although the Canadian executive suggested all of them. At issue was the perceived meaning of inviting lawyers. The Canadian saw the lawyer’s presence as facilitating the successful completion of the negotiation; the Egyptian interpreted it as signaling the Canadian’s mistrust of his verbal commitment. Canadians often use the impersonal formality of a lawyer’s services to finalize an agreement. Egyptians more frequently depend on a personal relationship developed between bargaining partners for the same purposes. If agreements are mostly person-based, then their written base may be less important. Thus the demand for renegotiation of clauses by a Middle Eastern buyer in a contract already negotiated and signed, should not be seen as astonishing. It should not necessarily lead to litigation. Behind the demand for renegotiation is the assumption that, if people really trust each other, they should go much further than simple and literal implementation of their written agreements. This leads to the following question; to what extent should the contract signature date be considered as a time line which signals the end of the negotiation? Different Attitudes Towards Litigation It is easy to understand that the function of litigation will be different for both sides. Recourse to litigation will be fairly easily made by those favoring written-based agreements as the ultimate means of resolving breaches of contract. The oral and personal tradition is less susceptible to recourse to litigation, because litigation has major drawbacks: (1) It breaks the implicit assumption of trust; (2) It breaches the required state of social harmony, especially in the Far Eastern countries, and may therefore be quite threatening for the community as a whole. As David states: . . . in Far Eastern countries, as well as in Black Africa and Madagascar . . . subject to the Westernization process which has been attempted, one does not find, as in Hinduism or Islam, a body of legal rules whose influence may be weakened by the recognized influence of other factors; it is the very notion of legal rules which is challenged. Despite authorities having sometimes established legal codes, it is well known and seems obvious that the prescriptions of these codes are not designed to be implemented literally. They should only be considered as simple patterns. The judge will be able to moderate their strictness and, moreover, it is hoped that this will not be necessary. The “good judge”, whether Chinese, Japanese or Vietnamese, is not concerned with making a good decision. The “good judge” is the one who succeeds in not making any award, because he has been skillful enough to lead the opponents to reconciliation. Any dispute, as it is a threat to social harmony, has to be solved by a settlement through conciliation. The individual only has “duties” towards the society. Recognition of “subjective rights” in his favor is out of the question. Law as it is conceived in the West is seen as good for barbarians, and the occupation of lawyer, in the limited extent that it exists, is regarded with contempt by the society. These remarks by a specialist in comparative law give a good idea of the differences of litigious tradition between the Far East and the West. In the field of contracts, the Western saying “the contract is the law of the parties” dominates the practices of international trade. But this is, in part, window- dressing. When negotiating intemationally, a set of written contracts is always signed. This is not to say that people choose either oral or written agreements as a basis for trust. The real question is rather: how should the mix of written and oral bases for trust, as they are perceived by the parties, be interpreted? People do not deal with conflicts in the same way. Negotiating together requires a capacity to envisage different ways of managing disputes. Not only differences in rationality and mental programs, but also differences in time representations, may lead to a partner “who thinks differently” being considered a partner “who thinks wrongly”. The utmost caution is recommended when interpreting the bases of trust, whether written documents or oral and personal bonds. Even in the Anglo- Saxon world, where it is preferred to “get-it-in-writing”, a number of business deals, sometimes large ones — in the area of finance, for instance — are based on a simple telex or fax, or the simple agreement between two key decision-makers. It would be a mistake to believe that personal relationships do not exist in places where written contracts are generally required. Moreover, in cultures where “my word is my bond”, it should never be forgotten that it is difficult to trust somebody who is not a member of the in-group, whether on a written or spoken basis. Therefore, trust has to be established (and monitored) on both bases, while at the same time keeping in mind a clear awareness of the limits of each. Conclusion The process of intercultural encounter in negotiation has been described as akin to a dance in which one dancer dances a waltz when the other dances a tango. There is, however, much adaptation in intercultural negotiation; negotiators tend to adjust to the other party’s behavior in ways that derive significantly from what would be the stereotypic attitude in their native culture. It is naturally difficult to step out from one’s own culture. However, negotiators exchange masses of information during a full negotiation and they process it in complex ways, that do not aim at an intellectual understanding of the beliefs and attitudes of the other party, but rather target mutual adjustment in view of maximizing outcomes. Negotiators therefore tend to adapt their behavior to the other party, at least to the extent they perceive as useful for smoothing the process and improving the outcomes. On average cultural adaptation, provided that it is done properly — without naïve imitation — is positively experienced by the other side. Pornpitakpan shows that neither the Japanese nor the Thais feel that their social identity is threatened by high adaptation coming from American sellers in sales negotiations. The Japanese buyers positively experience cultural adaptation by American sellers despite the marked tendency in Japan to make a clear-cut distinction between in-group members (nihon-jin) and out-group members (gai-jin). Culture clash in negotiation may be strong at the very start, when negotiators expect behaviour from the other side which normatively corresponds to what they are used to as well as to what they consider as the most appropriate for effective negotiation. Cultural adaptation is not necessarily symmetrical. For instance, Japanese negotiators tend to adjust to Americans by using more direct information sharing and less indirect communication than in negotiations with their countrymen, whereas Americans adapt less to their Japanese counterparts. A common professional culture may also help overcome the barriers related to cross-cultural understanding. That is why, culture often appears as a relatively poor predictor of the negotiation. Тема 4 Business Communication in Different Parts of the World. Business Negotiations Between Japanese and Americans. More than 35 years ago, anthropologist E. T. Hall warned, “When the American executive travels abroad to do business, he is frequently shocked to discover to what extent the many variables of foreign behavior and custom complicate his efforts”. Despite Hall’s comments, little attention has been paid to the “typically ethnocentric American” sitting across the table from “inscrutable Japanese customers”, trying to negotiate an acceptable business contract. This chapter attempts to shed light on this circumstance. The topic is most worthy of consideration since business negotiations with Japanese often fail for seemingly inexplicable reasons and because most others have ignored such questions. Conceptual Framework: A Framework for Understanding Negotiation Processes The most difficult aspect of international business negotiations is the actual conduct of the face-to-face meeting. Assuming that the best representatives have been chosen, and assuming those representatives are well-prepared, and that situational factors have been manipulated in one’s favor, things can still go sour at the negotiation table. Obviously, if these other preliminaries haven’t been managed properly, things will go wrong during the meetings. Even with great care and attention to preliminary details, managing the dynamics of the negotiation process is almost always the greatest challenge facing Americans seeking to do business with Japanese. Going into a business negotiation, most people have expectations about the “proper” or normal process of such a meeting. Based on these expectations, progress is measured and appropriate bargaining strategies are selected. That is, things may be done differently in the latter stages of a negotiation than they were in the earlier. Higher risk strategies may be employed to conclude the talks — as in the final two minutes of a close football game. But all such decisions about strategy are made relative to perceptions of progress through an expected course of events. Differences in the expectations held by parties from different cultures are one of the major difficulties in any cross-cultural business negotiation. Before we discuss differences between the processes of business negotiations in Japan and the United States, however, it is important to point out similarities. In both countries, business negotiations proceed through four stages: (i) non-task sounding; (ii) task-related exchange of information; (iii) persuasion; and (iv) concessions and agreement. The first stage, non-task sounding, includes all those activities which might be described as establishing a rapport or getting to know one another, but it does not include information related to the “business” of the meeting. The information exchanged in the second stage of business negotiations regards the parties’ needs and preferences, or, stated more precisely, the parties’ subjective expected utilities of the various alternatives open to the interactants. The third stage, persuasion, involves the parties’ attempts to modify one another’s subjective expected utilities through the use of various persuasive tactics. The final stage of business negotiations involves the consummation of an agreement which often is the summation of a series of concessions or smaller agreements. Despite the consistency of this process across cultures, the content and duration of the four stages differ substantially between the two cultural groups (see Table 16.1). Compared to the Japanese, Americans spend little time establishing a relationship.1 It is imperative to avoid stereotyping the behavior of Japanese and American managers. Moreover, personalities may be even more important than cultural norms, particularly in business negotiations. Even so, an understanding of norms, particularly when there are major differences, should help negotiators on both sides of the table be more patient The typical Japanese negotiation may involve a series of non-task interactions and even ceremonial gift giving. Witness the media attention given to the very large kosai-hi (literally, entertainment expenses) that once were typical of business dealings in Japan: “While the Japanese defense budget is 0.9% of the country’s GNP, corporate wining and dining accounts for 1.5% of the total national output” (Time 1981). In the 1990s, since the steep decline in the Japanese economy, Japanese executives have cut back on the “excesses” of the 1980s. Even so, a greater emphasis on business entertainment by the Japanese will be noticeable. To the American critic, this may seem a waste. However, the Japanese make a great effort in the beginning to establish a harmonious relationship. In America, the second stage (exchanging task-related information) is relatively direct, with clear statements of needs and preferences. For the Japanese, this exchange of information is the main part of the negotiation. A “complete” understanding is imperative. The Japanese are reported to ask Table 16.1: Four stages of business negotiations. Japan United States 1. Non-task sounding 2. Task-related exchange of information Considerable time and expense devoted to such efforts is the practice in Japan. This is the most important step — high first offers with long explanations and in- depth clarification. Relatively shorter periods are typical. Information is given briefly and directly. “Fair” first offers are more typical. 3. Persuasion Persuasion is accomplished primarily behind the scenes. Vertical status relations dictate bargaining outcomes. The most important step, minds are changed at the negotiation table and aggressive persuasive tactics used. 4. Concessions and agreement Concessions are made only toward the end of negotiations — a holistic approach to decision making. Progress is difficult to measure for Americans. Concessions and commitments are made throughout — a sequential approach to decision making. “endless” questions while offering little information and ambiguous responses. Japanese negotiators spend much more time trying to understand the situation and associated details of one another’s bargaining position. Americans tend to spend the most time in the third stage of negotiation — persuasion. Americans openly disagree and use aggressive persuasive tactics such as threats and warnings. Alternatively, Japanese take the time to understand one another during the first two stages of the negotiation, so little persuasion is necessary, and they avoid confrontations and respond to threats by a change of subject, a silent period, or withdrawal. For Japanese, it is more important to maintain the relationship than to be frank and open. Regarding the fourth and final stage of business negotiations, Americans tend to make concessions throughout, settling one issue, then proceeding to the next. Thus, the final agreement is a sequence of several smaller concessions, and progress is easy to measure. The Japanese tend to make concessions at the end of the negotiation, and agreements are concluded rather abruptly from the American point of view. Such differences are a major point of procedural conflict for trans-Pacific negotiations. The following presentation of recommendations regarding face-to-face meetings with Japanese clients is ordered according to the four stages typical in most business negotiations. First comes non-task sounding. Non-Task Sounding Americans always discuss topics other than business at the negotiations table (e.g. the weather, family, sports, politics, business conditions in general), but not for long. Usually, the discussion is moved to the specific business at hand after 5 to 10 minutes. Such preliminary talk is much more than just being friendly or polite. Before getting to the “business” at hand, it is important to learn how the other side feels this particular day. One can determine during non-task sounding if a client’s attention is focused on business or distracted by other matters, personal or professional. Learning about a client’s background and interests also provides important cues about appropriate communication styles. To the extent that people’s backgrounds are similar, communication can be more efficient. Engineers can use technical jargon when talking to other engineers. Golfers can use golfing analogies “the deal is ‘in the rough’” — with other golfers. Those with children can compare the cash drain of “putting a kid through college”, and so on. During these initial stages of conversation, judgments, too, are made about the “kind” of person(s) with whom one is dealing: Can this person be truste Will he be reliable? How much power does she have in her organization? All such judgments are made before business discussions even begin. So there is a definite purpose to these preliminary non-task discussions. Although most people are often unaware of it, such time almost always is used to size up (or “sound”, in the nautical sense) one’s clients. Depending on the results of this sounding process, proposals and arguments are formed using different jargon and analogies. Or it may be decided not to discuss business at all if clients are distracted by other personal matters or if the other person seems untrustworthy. All this sounds like a lot to accomplish in 5 or 10 minutes, but that’s how long it usually takes in the United States. This is not the case in Japan; the goals of the non-task sounding are identical, but the time spent is much longer. In the United States, firms resort to lawyers when they’ve made a bad deal because of a mistake in sizing up a client or vendor. In Japan, lawyers are not used for such purposes. Instead, Japanese executives spend substantial time and effort in non-task sounding so that problems do not develop later. Japanese clients and suppliers will want to spend much more time in non-task sounding than Americans will want, and Americans must reconsider, from the Japanese perspective, the importance of this stage of bargaining if negotiations with Japanese are to be successful. Negotiations with Japanese firms often include three levels of executives — top executives, middle managers, and operational staff. Depending on the level of the negotiations, the process of non-task sounding is somewhat different, so we will first discuss recommendations for non-task sounding among top executives, and then we will discuss the processes among middle managers and operational staff. Non-Task Sounding for Top Executives The role of the top executive in Japanese negotiations is usually ceremonial in nature. Ordinarily, top executives are brought into negotiations only to sign the agreement, and this only after all issues have been settled and agreed upon by lower-level executives. On occasion, top executives are included earlier to communicate commitment and importance. In either case, the main activity of top executives is non-task sounding. The ceremony, formality and apparent triviality will seem very out of place for American executives, because to most Americans it will seem “unnatural” to avoid discussing specific business and to leave the persuasion to others. They need, however, a very clear understanding of their role in the negotiation, though getting them to make adjustments in their behavior may be difficult. It could be helpful to supply a long list of “non-task sounding” questions for them to ask during such sessions. It is important, too, that American executives understand that what is said is not so important, from a Japanese perspective, as how things are said. The Japanese top executive is making gut-level judgments about the integrity, reliability, commitment and humility of his American counterpart particularly if the Japanese is considerably older or if his company is more powerful. The non-task sounding provides a context or vehicle for making such judgments. To the Americans, the “content” of early conversations — words and verbal information may seem inane, but the Japanese regard as critical the non-verbal messages and feelings the wa (interpersonal harmony) and shinyo (trust) such talk conveys. Non-Task Sounding for Middle-Level Executives Establishing business relationships in the United States typically involves certain procedures, such as a letter of introduction, followed by a phone call for an appointment, then a meeting at the client’s office (including 5 to 10 minutes of non-task sounding followed by the business proposal), and perhaps lunch, with more business talk. Almost always, after 5 or 10 minutes of non-task sounding, an American client will ask, “Well, what can I do for you?” In Tokyo, the typical routine goes something like this: The initial appointment will be set up and attended by a shokai-sha (third-party introducer), and the Japanese client will invite the American party, including the shokai-sha, for a late afternoon (approximately 4 p.m.) meeting at the Japanese firm’s offices. There, the Americans will meet the concerned operational-level personnel for a “ chat”, not to include business talk or proposals. At around 6 p.m., the Japanese suggest dinner. Ordinarily, they will pick the restaurant and pick up the tab. Americans will not have a chance to “fight” for the bill because they will never see one. At this point, business talk still is inappropriate. After dinner, the Japanese will suggest a few drinks, and conversation with the bar hostesses will be the bill of fare. The sessions ordinarily go on at past 11 p.m. and end with the scheduling of future meetings. While the 1990s have witnessed cutbacks in the lavish expenditures of the 1980s, the need for more informal non-task time in Japan persists. Throughout the introductions, the business of the meeting, the purposes of the visit, are not discussed. Again, vague and indirect references to a future relationship may be made, but only in response to similar comments by the Japanese. The Japanese will be looking for integrity, sincerity, a cooperative attitude shinyo and wa. Economics will come later. Task-related Exchange of Information Only when the non-task sounding is complete, when wa has been established, should business be introduced. American executives are advised to let the Japanese side decide when such substantive discussions should begin. Typically, the Japanese will signal their readiness for an exchange of task- related information, after tea or coffee has been served, by remarks such as, “Can you tell me more about your company?” or “Tell me, what has brought you to Japan?” A task-related exchange of information implies a two-way communication process. However, observations suggest that when Americans meet Japanese across a negotiating table, the information flow is unidirectional from Americans to Japanese. The Japanese appear: (i) to ask “thousands” of questions; and (ii) to give little feedback. The first severely tests American negotiators’ patience, and the latter causes them great anxiety. Both can add up to much longer stays in Japan (compared to negotiating in other countries), which means higher travel expenses. Giving Information The most obvious problem associated with providing information to Japanese clients will be doing so in another language. It is true that there are many more Japanese executives who understand and speak English than there are Americans who understand and speak Japanese, thus meetings on both sides of the Pacific usually can be handled in English. Americans should be careful, however, of misunderstandings that can arise from the Japanese side’s limited knowledge of English. Often, confusion can result because Japanese executives are too polite to indicate they do not understand. When doubt exists, Americans should use visual media (slides, brochures, videos, etc.), and should provide copies of written support materials. American negotiators should provide an interpreter, if the Japanese side has not, and even then there may be critical stages when an interpreter should be included on the American negotiation team as well. Even with the best of interpreters, language problems still can be sources of misunderstandings. Economists suggest that Americans and Japanese have different conceptualizations of the word profit and that these differences lead to what general semanticists call bypassing. Bypassing occurs when two people use the same word. Japanese and American negotiators, usually communicating in English, initially may think they are in agreement regarding profit and profitability discussions when in fact they are not. This false agreement can lead to bewilderment, confusion, frustration, and perhaps failure in future negotia- tions. Once comfortable with the language, attention can be turned to more subtle aspects of giving information to the Japanese. The first of these has to do with the order of presentation. In the United Stages, negotiators tend to say what they want and explain the reasons behind the request only if necessary. That’s why the task-related exchange of information goes quickly in America. Things don’t work this way in Japan. Very long explanations come first, then the request/proposal. Accordingly, it is not surprising to hear the American executives’ complaints about the “1000 questions”. The Japanese expect long explanations. American negotiators should be prepared with detailed information to back up their proposals and should include appropriate technical experts on negotiation teams, as their contribution will be required. Finally, we recommend the Japanese style of presentation, with background and explana- tions presented first and the actual request/proposal made only toward the end. While such an approach will take longer, with Japanese clients it will obtain better results. Another reason for the “1000 questions” has to do with the consensus decision-making style of Japanese organizations. Several people on their side may ask for the same information or explanation. Most Americans find this repetitive questioning irritating and even insulting. “ Didn’t they believe me the first time?” Such tactics should be viewed in light of the Japanese consensus decision-making style when everyone must be convinced, not just the key decision maker. To some degree this questioning may be a tactic to make sure explanations hold up under close scrutiny. A degree of patience with this process is recommended, along with the kind of detailed preparations necessary to prevent inconsistent answers. Americans tend to make initial offers they consider “fair” or near what they expect the eventual agreement to be, while Japanese executives expect to spend time in bargaining and tend to ask for more initially. Thus, Americans dealing with Japanese clients should present second lowest offers first. The same can be anticipated from them. They initially may ask for more than appears reasonable, but they will move from that position, albeit with reluctance. After each party has supported its “ second best offer” with detailed explanations, the Japanese consider it “fair” behavior to move however reluctantly from their initial position. American bargainers should guard against their own tendency to make concessions during the exchange of information. Often they are impatient with the process and make concessions before they have determined what the Japanese negotiators’ interests and positions are. Americans need to constrain their natural urge to get on to stage three, persuasion, via making concessions in the hope that the Japanese will reciprocate. Getting Information Hopefully Japanese clients will be the ones seeking American business, because in such situations the Japanese will be the ones making the proposals and supplying more information than appears necessary. In situations where American firms initiate contact or try to make sales, they experience great difficulty in getting feedback on their proposals. For example, if they ask a group of Japanese executives what they think of an American firm’s price quote, the Japanese will often say, “ Oh, it looks fine”, even if they think the quote is totally unacceptable. Americans need to consider, for a moment, the Japanese reasons for such “strange” behavior. In the first place, no Japanese, especially not the boss, will venture to speak for the entire group until a consensus has been reached. Second, the Japanese executives wish to maintain the wa, and, from their point of view, a negative (albeit honest) answer during the negotiation may disrupt the harmony already established. Finally, even the most experienced American negotiator may not be able to read the subtle, non-verbal, negative cues that another Japanese executive would read (via tone of voice, body movements, pauses in speech, looks of surprise, etc.) along with the politely offered phrase, “Oh, it looks fine”. Besides their language differences, the non-verbal behaviors of Japanese and American executives differ. The Japanese conversational style in both simulated and real business negotiations includes much less eye contact than the American style. This difference seems to cause problems for both sides. The Japanese report discomfort at the “aggressive staring” of the Americans. Americans suggest that “something must be wrong” because the Japanese won’t look them in the eye. Eye contact and movements, ordinarily a source of information about the other person’s feelings, don’t communicate across cultural barriers. Most people process such information as the facial expression of a client reacting to a proposal, etc., but in the United States such processing often is subconscious. Attention should always be paid to this channel of information, however. Many American executives report great frustration in trying to read Japanese negotiators’ “poker faces”. In our studies of videotapes of simulated business negotiations involving Japanese we found little difference in the quantity of facial expression. Rather, the inscrutability has more to do with the timing and cultural rules for facial expressions. This, then, is the reason we hear наvery experienced Americans say, “I make deals all over the world. Everywhere I go I can pretty much tell where I stand with my clients — everywhere, that is, except Japan”. How, then, are Americans ever to get at the honne, or true mind, of Japanese negotiators? At the negotiation table, the tatemae (truthful, official stance) often isn’t very helpful. An informal channel of communication, which can be established only between and through the lower levels of the negotiation teams, is the only way Americans can become privy to the honne. This, then, is the primary reason for including lower-level executives on negotiation teams. Besides, it would be too difficult, without some division of efforts, to handle both formal communica- tions at the negotiating table and informal communications after hours. Management of the informal channel of communications is critical for efficient and successful negotiations, as it can be a delicate undertaking. During the non-task sounding activities, lower-level members of the American team should be assigned the task of establishing rapport with the operational level managers on the Japanese side. Then, throughout the task-related exchange of information and the rest of the negotiations, they should invest in after-hours nurturing such relationships. They can begin by simply asking the selected and/ or indicated Japanese executive(s) out for a drink “to solve our companies’ problems”. The Japanese will be looking to open such a channel of communication, and the Americans should be alert for such overtures. Once this informal channel has been opened, it will be used for aggressive persuasive tactics (discussed later) and to learn how the Japanese really feel about proposals and the associated arguments. After hours, such information is communicated in restaurants, over drinks, and at bath houses. It emanates from and is transmitted to all members of the Japanese negotiation team. While everyone knows about this informal channel of communication, it is critical that it remains “under the table”, and any reference to such a channel (e.g. “Suzuki-san told Mr Smith last night that . . .”) will lead to elimination of the “leak” by immediate dismissal of Mr Suzuki from the negotiations. The following illustrates the importance of this informal channel. A large American firm sought to acquire a smaller Japanese firm. Talks between executives of the two companies had not been fruitful. Although the Japanese executives showed initial interest in the deal and the American firm had a final proposal ready, the Japanese seemed to be hesitant. The American side decided on a wait-and-see strategy, and nothing happened for almost six months. Then, a lower-level manager of the American firm received a call from an acquaintance (they had played golf and had a drinks together a few times) asking if they could have drinks. When they met, the Japanese explained the delays: “ I have something to tell you that just couldn’t be talked about by my boss to your boss ’ He went on to explain the primary problems, from the Japanese point of view, which were with the acquisition price and the renaming of the company. Once these were out in “the open” (the informal “gut spilling” by these lower-level players was never discussed), the companies were able to deal with both issues. The Japanese side simply felt it inappropriate to voice such objections to a higher-status buyer and potential owner at the negotiation table, using a formal communication channel. Persuasion In Japan, a clear separation does not exist between task-related exchange of information and persuasion. The two stages tend to blend together as each side defines and refines its needs and preferences. Much time is spent in the task- related exchange of information, leaving little to “argue” about during the persuasion stage. Indeed, Robert March reports that Japanese negotiators tend to prepare for negotiations in a way that differs greatly from how Americans prepare: They [Japanese negotiators] developed defensive arguments with no consideration of persuading or selling or converting the other side. Nor did they consider what the other side might be thinking or offering, nor of anticipated strategies, nor of any concession strategies. A strong consensus was reached based on the arguments supporting their position after the leader had reviewed these and everyone had noted them down. There was strong group cohesion. However, from the American perspective, persuasion is the heart of a negotiation. Once it is determined what each side wants, then “the fun” begins — trying to change the other side’s mind and bring them closer to one’s own side’s proposal. Many persuasive tactics can be applied, and often are, to change clients’ minds. Researchers at the Kellogg School of Business Administration at Northwestern University have come up with a list of such persuasive tactics (Table 16.2). We have observed Americans using all such persuasive tactics. Table 16.3 is a list of persuasive tactics considered appropriate in Japan. One of the primary differences between American and Japanese bargaining styles has to do with the importance of the role or power position of the bargainer. Relationships in Japan, whether personal or business, are vertical in nature. A simple analogy demonstrates this: bargaining in Japan is like an interaction between father and son, while in America it is like that of two brothers. The point is, the repertoire of persuasive tactics available to bargainers in Japan is prescribed by status/power relations. Buyers, playing the role of “father”, can say things to sellers that sellers would not even consider saying to buyers. Alternatively, buyers and sellers in the United States are on much more of an equal footing (although still not completely equal). Another important factor in Japan is where specific tactics are used. That is, at the negotiation table, bargainers are limited to the use of questions, self- disclosures, and other positive tactics that influence behaviors. Aggressive influence tactics, which can be used only by negotiators in high power/status positions, should be communicated through the low-level, informal commu- nication channel. Even there, threats, commands, etc., are subtle and indirect. This makes establishing an informal channel of communication doubly important to the American side, because it not only can provide a “reading” of Japanese clients but will allow them to employ persuasive tactics that would be completely inappropriate (from the Japanese perspective) at the formal talks. To sum up, if an impasse is reached with Japanese clients, rather than trying to persuade them in the usual American manner, it is appropriate to use the following nine persuasive tactics, in order and in the specified circumstances: (1) Ask more questions. The single most important consideration is the use of questions as a persuasive tactic. This is true not only in Japan but anywhere in the world, including the United States. Chester Karrass in his book, The Negotiation Game, suggests that sometimes it is “smart to be a little bit dumb” in business negotiations. Ask the same questions more than once; for example, “I didn’t completely understand what you meant — can you please explain that again?” If clients or potential business partners have good answers, then perhaps it is best to compromise on the issue. Often, however, under close and repeated scrutiny their answers are not Table 16.2: Bargaining tactics, definitions, and examples (Anglemar & Stern 1978). POSITIVE INFLUENCE TACTICS Promise. A statement in which the source indicates his intention to provide the target with a reinforcing consequence which source anticipates target will evaluate as pleasant, positive, or rewarding. “If you can deliver the equipment by 1 June, we will make another order right away.” Recommendation. A statement in which the source predicts that a pleasant environmental consequence will occur to the target. Its occurrence is not under the source’s control. “If you keep the company name after the acquisition, then your present customers will stay with the company.” Reward. A statement by the source that is thought to create pleasant consequences for the target. “This negotiation is progressing smoothly because you have prepared well.” Positive normative appeal. A statement in which the source indicates that the target’s past, present, or future behavior was or will be in conformity with social norms. “Lowering your price in light of the new information will demonstrate your interest in good principles of business.” AGGRESSIVE INFLUENCE TACTICS Threat. Same as promise, except that the reinforcing consequences are thought to be noxious, unpleasant, or punishing. “If you insist on those terms we will have to find another suitor for our company.” Warning. Same as recommendation, except that the consequences are thought to be noxious. unpleasant, or punishing. “If we can’t get together at this stage, few other companies will be interested in your proposal.” Punishment. Same as reward, except that the consequences are thought to be unpleasant. “You can’t possibly mean that. Only a fool would ask for such a high price.” Negative normative appeal. Same as positive normative appeal, except that the target’s behavior is in violation of social norms. “No one else we deal with requires that kind of guarantee.” Command. A statement in which the source suggests that the target performs a certain behavior. “It’s your turn to make a counter offer.” INFORMATION EXCHANGE TACTICS Commitment. A statement by the source to the effect that its future bids will not go below or above a certain level. “We will deliver the equipment within three months, and at the price we originally quoted.” Table 16.2: Continued. Self-Disclosure. A statement in which the source reveals information about itself. “My company now requires an ROI of at least 15% during the first year.” Question. A statement in which the source asks the target to reveal information about itself. “Why are you asking for such a high royalty pay- ment?” very good. When their weak position has been exposed, they will be obligated to concede. Questions can elicit key information, being powerful yet passive persuasive devices. Indeed, the use of questions is a favored Japanese tactic which they will use against you. (2) Re-explain your company’s situation, needs, and preferences. (3) Use other positive influence tactics. (4) If still dissatisfied with the Japanese response, try silence. Let them think about your proposal and give them an opportunity to change their position. Be aware, however, that the Japanese are the world’s experts at the use of silence and that your Japanese clients are likely to use it frequently. (5) If tactics 1 through 4 produce no concessions, change the subject or call a recess and put the informal communication channel to work. At this level, it would be appropriate, rather than going directly to more aggressive tactics, to try tactics 1 through 4 again. Continuing to ask questions and offer explanations may cause new information to surface that could not be broached at the negotiation table. Table 16.3: Persuasive tactics appropriate for negotiations with Japanese. At the Negotiation Table Informal Channels and Buyers Only 1. Questions 1. Aggressive influence tactics 2. Self-disclosures 3. Positive influence tactics 4. Silence 5. Change subject 6. Recess and delays 7. Concessions and commitments (6) Only in special circumstances and with an awareness of the great risk involved should aggressive tactics be used with Japanese. They should be used only when the American company is clearly in the stronger position (e.g. monopoly power, larger size, the Japanese company has come courting), and they must be carried out only via the informal channel in the most indirect manner possible. Rather than an American saying, “If your company can’t lower its price, then we’ll go to another supplier”, it would be better if he said, “Lower prices on the part of your company would go a long way toward our not having to consider other options available to us”. Even then, the use of aggressive persuasion tactics probably will damage wa, which in the long run may be to the American company’s disadvantage. If power relations ever shift, the Japanese will be quick to exploit the change of events. If the American side exercises restraint and maintains the wa, then the Japanese, if and when power relations shift, will consider the American company’s interests. This latter point is difficult for most Americans to believe. “Why should they consider our interests?” We have, however, witnessed Japanese executives behave in this way several times. For example, some years ago, International Multi-Food Company (IMFC) sold franchise rights for the Mr Donut chain to Duskin Ltd. in Japan. Initially, IMFC provided the know- how (operations and marketing) for a successful venture in Japan. Indeed, ten years later the franchise revenues from Duskin exceeded the total profits IMFC made from its U.S. operations. When, IMFC executives met with Duskin to re-negotiate the franchise agreement, they anticipated changes in the agreement (reduced royalties, etc.) to reflect the change in power relations. Certainly, an American franchisee would have demanded such an adjustment. However, because IMFC initially had been careful to maintain wa with the Japanese clients, the president of Duskin simply offered to renew the agreement. Needless to say, the IMFC executives were pleasantly surprised. (7) If tactics 1 through 6 have not produced concessions by the Japanese, we suggest that they employ the use of time. This tactic requires the cooperation and understanding of the American home office. Give the Japanese time to consider new information and time to reach a consensus. They almost never make concessions immediately following persuasive appeals, because the entire group must consult and agree. This takes time. Unfortunately, American bargainers seem to find the use of the time tactic most difficult. “Letting things hang” goes against their nature, but it may be necessary, in the hope that the Japanese will run into their time limits before you run into yours. Consensus decision making and their long-term approach to business deals seem to enhance the effectiveness of tactical delays for Japanese bargaining with Americans. (8) The next persuasive tactic that can be used with Japanese clients is asking the shokai-sha to arbitrate differences by calling the Japanese clients and serving as a go-between. Though shokai-sha often successfully settles otherwise irreconcilable differences, serious consideration should be given to making concessions before calling in shokai-sha, because third-party arbitration ordinarily will work only once. (9) As a last resort, bring together top executives of the two companies to see if that will stimulate more cooperation using a top-down approach. Such a tactic is, however, fraught with danger, particularly if negative influence tactics have been used in the past. A refusal at this stage means the business is finished. To conclude our discussion of persuasive tactics, we want to emphasize the importance of our recommendations. A mistake at this stage, even a minor one, can have serious consequences for Japanese/American cooperation. American managers will have to be doubly conscientious to avoid blunders here because the Japanese style of persuasion is so different and, apparently, cumbersome. Remember that the Japanese are looking to establish a long-term business relationship of mutual benefit. Threats and the like do not fit into their understanding of how such a relationship should work. They are not in a hurry, because they are concerned about wa and cooperation in the long run. We recommend, moreover, that you adopt a Japanese approach to persuasion when bargaining with Japanese clients and business partners. Such an approach may take longer, but, in the end both companies will benefit by using it. Finally, smart American negotiators will anticipate the Japanese use of the nine persuasive tactics described in this section of the chapter. Concessions and Agreement The final stage of business negotiations involves concession making, building toward agreement. Negotiation requires compromise. Usually, both sides give up something to get even more. However, the approaches used for compromise differ on the two sides of the Pacific. Americans and other Western business executives tend to take a sequential approach to solving complex problems. That is, “ Let’s discuss and settle quantity, then price, then delivery, then after-sale service”, and so on. Alternatively, the Asian approach is more holistic — looking at all issues simultaneously and not agreeing on any single issue until the end. Americans often are very upset by such differences in style of concession making. American managers report great difficulty in measuring progress. “After all, in America you’re half done when half the issues are settled”. In Japan, nothing seems to get settled. Then — surprise — the negotiation is done. Frequently, impatient Americans make unnecessary concessions right before agreements are announced by the Japanese. These difficulties reflect more differences than just in decision-making styles (sequential vs. holistic). The differences go deeper than that. In the American view, a business negotiation is a problem-solving activity, the solution being a deal that suits both parties. From the Japanese standpoint, a business negotiation is a time to develop a business relationship with the goal of long- term mutual benefit. For the Japanese the economic issues are the context, not the content, of the talks. Settling any one issue is not really so important. Such details will take care of themselves once a viable, harmonious business relationship is established. Once the relationship has been established, signaled by the first “agreement”, then the other “details” are settled quickly. American bargainers in Japan should expect this holistic approach and should be prepared to discuss all issues simultaneously and in what may appear to be a haphazard order. Progress in the talks should not be measured by how many issues have been settled. Rather, Americans must try to gauge the quality of the business relationship by watching for the following important signals of progress: • higher-level Japanese executives being included in the discussions; • their questions beginning to focus on specific areas of the deal; • a softening of their attitudes and positions on some of the issues, such as, “Let us take some time to study this issue”; • at the negotiation table increased talk among themselves in Japanese, which may often mean they’re trying to decide something; and • increased bargaining and use of the lower-level, informal channels of communication. A crucial part of preparing for negotiations is deciding upon and writing down planned concession strategies. Americans need to follow such strategies with care, because “trading” concessions will not work with Japanese bargainers who will settle nothing until everything can be settled. After all issues and interests have been exposed and discussed fully, to help establish the relationship, make concessions on minor issues first. Besides following a plan in making concessions, American negotiators in Japan should take care that concessions are made following recesses in the talks, not at the negotiation table the first time the topic is broached. It is better to reconsider each concession away from the social pressures of the formal negotiations. Again, this is a Japanese practice. Because of the nature of their consensus decision-making process, you will find that the Japanese frequently “have to check with the home office”. This is a negotiation practice which Americans would do well to emulate, particularly in Japan. Having limited authority can be an important check on “run-away” concession making. In conclusion, American managers will spend more time putting deals together with Japanese clients or partners than with other Americans. If the negotiation processes are handled adroitly, the U.S. negotiators can look forward to long, mutually beneficial business relationships with Japanese partner 1.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to infantilizingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants like she enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments before (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman scoffs, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"# INT. SUBURBAN FAMILY HOME - DAY We open on a sunny, tree-lined street. The birds are singing, and there is the distant sound of children playing. The camera slides down the street and stops in front of a cozy family home. We see LAYLA HASSAN (23), an Arab-American college student with a bookish demeanor. Layla wears khaki cargo pants and a loose-fitting sweater. She walks with an unmistakable urgency, clutching her stomach occasionally. Her face is tight with discomfort and focus as she makes her desperate approach to the front door of her house. CUT TO: # EXT. HASSAN FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS LAYLA reaches the front door and searches her pockets for her keys. Panic crosses her face upon not finding them. Her distress escalates as she begins knocking frantically. CUT TO: # INT. HASSAN FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS LAYLA’s mother, FARAH HASSAN (50s), Arabic in features with lines that tell of a life rich in laughter, stirs from her nap on the living room couch. Drowsy and disheveled, she calls out groggily. FARAH (yawning) Who’s there? CUT TO: # EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS LAYLA (near panic) Mom, it’s me! Open up, quick! Farah takes her time reaching the door, unlocking it with yawns in between, as Layla dances on the spot, holding her abdomen, pleading with every ounce of her being. LAYLA Mom, please just open the door! The door finally swings open, revealing Farah, concern knitting her brows as she notices Layla's distress. FARAH Layla, honey, what’s— Before FARAH can finish, LAYLA attempts to bolt past her. LAYLA Move, please! I gotta— FARAH, still half in the fog of sleep, instinctively grabs LAYLA, blocking her path to understanding what’s wrong. FARAH (grabbing Layla) What's wrong? Tell me! LAYLA tries to wriggle free from Farah’s grip, the urgency in her voice escalating to a panic. LAYLA (pleading) Mom, let go, I need to— In the unfolding chaos, FARAH inadvertently applies pressure to LAYLA's stomach, squeezing it. LAYLA groans unexpectedly, her expression morphs to one of horror and untimely relief. We see a moment of realization in her eyes as she begins to lose control. LAYLA (groaning) No, no, no... LAYLA is frozen mid-stride, an awkward and desperate stance as she involuntarily releases her bowels. CLOSE-UP on FARAH, whose confusion grows. LAYLA grunts softly, a mixture of embarrassment and pleasure reflected in her conflicted expression. FARAH (alarmed) Layla? Are you okay, what's— LAYLA (strained, hushed) I’m... fine. It’s just... relief. FARAH sniffs the air then reels back, covering her nose, eyes widening as the odor becomes apparent. LAYLA finishes with an exhaustive sigh, still motionless. FARAH (disgusted) Did you just...? LAYLA avoids her mom's eyes, sheepishly trying to step into the house. LAYLA Can I just get past, please? FARAH steps aside, still reeling from the odor, letting LAYLA in. As LAYLA gingerly waddles past her, cupping the seat of her pants, FARAH scolds her, while trying to fan away the smell. FARAH That’s just nasty, Layla. At your age, too… LAYLA (indignant, but sheepish) I needed to go! You squeezed me. It’s your fault! FARAH (tsk-tsking) My fault? There’s no excuse for you to finish in your pants. Look at this mess! LAYLA, while wincing, reaches back her hand to assess the damage playfully. LAYLA I had no choice, mom... FARAH insists on a closer look; she turns LAYLA around delicately but can't help her astonishment at the sight. FARAH How can you walk around like this? LAYLA (mock offense) You’re the one keeping me from cleaning up. FARAH goes in for a mock sniff near LAYLA's backside and recoils. FARAH If you're going to act like a child... LAYLA forces a nonchalant sniff of the air and reacts, a smirk on her lips. LAYLA Terrible indeed, but I think you might enjoy it, no? FARAH scoffs and ushers LAYLA off to the bathroom. FARAH Go clean up, you stink! LAYLA wanders off in an exaggerated waddle; FARAH continues fanning the air as we FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"реши загадку.","output":"Какую загадку ты хотел бы, чтобы я решил?"},{"instruction":"одна женщина рожает ребенка за 9 месяцев.

Sayori, the undead girl whose optimism shined brighter than her pallid complexion, nudged Nitazar with a playful smile. \\"I still can't believe you aced that Flight Magic exam. I saw you studying, like, once?\\" Nitazar preened his vibrant draconic scales and flicked his tail with a grin. \\"What can I say, Sayori? The skies call to me.

With a flicker akin to a magic trick, her bump vanished from view. Sayori leaned forward, her undead curiosity piqued. \\"That shirt is something else, Gervi. Our goblin friends really outdid themselves with that design.\\" Gervivien's sapphire eyes danced with pride. \\"Indeed. It's a blend of arcane energy and advanced textile engineering. Here, watch.\\" She lifted the shirt, revealing the gentle protrusions of her twin bump. Each movement, each flutter beneath the skin, was evident to their amazed eyes. Then, she let the hem fall back into place. The shirt's magic activated instantly, and once again, Gervivien's silhouette was as smooth and uninterrupted as the surface of Stillwater Pond. Sayori clapped in delight. \\"That's incredible. You could practically sneak out any treat from the lunch hall.\\" Pakinaki chimed in with a chuckle, \\"Ooh, I can see it now. The Great Nightborne Heist! Can I be part of the crew?\\" Nudge followed nudge as the friends erupted into a chorus of laughter, the pure joy of their voices echoing across the floating island. Their camaraderie transcended old faction lines, representing the new world they were building together—one friendship, one shared laugh at a time. Amidst the laughter, Nitazar glanced around at his friends and mused aloud, \\"Do you ever think about how strange it is? Our parents, grandparents, they fought against each other. And look at us—\\" Sayori finished his thought, \\"Learning together, laughing together. I like to think we're the future they fought for.\\" The group paused as the weight of her words settled. It was true; they had inherited a world of peace, one that had been unimaginable a century ago. This floating island wasn't just their school; it was a symbol of unity, balance, and hope for all of Azeroth. \\"And we'll make sure it stays that way, for every generation after us,\\" Gervivien said, her voice firm with conviction. Their shared resolve, born of ancient animosities laid to rest, drew them closer. On this day, amid playful banter and enchanted garments, the future of Azeroth gestated within the hearts of the young—a blend of horde and alliance, of hope and possibility, of laughter and undying friendship. The bell rang, signaling the end of recess.

The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to infantilizingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants like she enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments before (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman scoffs, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - LATE AFTERNOON A narrow residential street lined with modest houses, parked cars, and the occasional tree dappled in sunlight sets the scene. A YOUNG ARAB-AMERICAN WOMAN, LAYLA, early 20s, wearing a smart, form-fitting tunic top and loose-fitting khaki slacks, walks briskly with a stack of college textbooks clutched to her chest. Layla has long, wavy black hair tied loosely in a ponytail and wears light-rimmed glasses that slide down the bridge of her nose due to her hurried pace. The distress on her face is evident; her brow is furrowed with sweat beading at her temples - a result of both the late afternoon heat and her increasing desperation. EXT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Layla approaches the front door of her family’s single-story house, her pace quickening, her face a blend of discomfort and urgency. She fumbles in her bag, becoming more frantic when she can't find her keys. She shifts her weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other, fighting the overwhelming urge to relieve herself. Realizing her keys are missing, she knocks feverishly on the door. INT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS AMAL, early 50s, Layla’s mother, is a stout yet sprightly woman with hair showing strands of silver. She is dressed in comfortable clothes - a colorful kaftan that flows loosely around her. Her face wears the softened groggy imprint of a nap. The sound of urgent knocking stirs her from her drowsiness. AMAL (startled) Alaahh, who could that be at this hour? CUT TO: EXT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Layla shifts uncomfortably, knocking again, harder. Layla’s state of near panic gives her a childlike helplessness. Her academic demeanor is now at odds with the situation. LAYLA (panting) Please, someone open up... INT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Amal, puzzled but moving unhurriedly due to her post-nap sluggishness, approaches the door. AMAL (half-yawning) Hold on... hold on, I'm coming. EXT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Layla’s attempts at composure are failing; any semblance of her mature, studious exterior is slipping away. LAYLA (impatiently) Mom, hurry, please! INT. THE FAMILY’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Amal twists the lock and opens the door to find Layla near tears. AMAL (puzzled) Layla, habibti, what is it? Why such urgency? Layla tries to push past, but Amal, now concerned and confused by her daughter’s rare show of distress, instinctively reaches out to hold her. AMAL (concerned) Tell me, what's wrong? LAYLA (straining) I really need to get past, Mom, please just— Layla’s pleading is cut short as a struggle ensues. Amal's holding onto Layla not realizing she’s applying pressure on her abdomen. LAYLA (desperately trying to keep calm) Mom, please—you don’t under— CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - LAYLA A groan of discomfort and shock escapes Layla as she loses the battle with her bowels. Her eyes widen as she feels the warm, solid sensation growing in her pants, the reality of the situation visibly washing over her. She’s frozen, almost in disbelief, the strain replaced with unsolicited relief. LONG SHOT - FROM LAYLA’S BACK From behind, it’s evident what’s happening as Layla's posture contorts awkwardly; her textbooks drop to the ground with a thud. The once crisp khaki slacks now distort with the bulk forming. AMAL (startled) Layla? Layla, ya binti, what is happening? Layla is silent for a long moment as she continues to relieve herself, involuntary grunts expressing the paradoxical blend of discomfort and pleasure. LAYLA (voice strained) Please, just... step back... AMAL (insistently) Why are you standing like this? You're scaring me, Layla. A beat passes before Layla, still engaged in the involuntary, unending moment of release, mutters with an embarrassed sense of satisfaction. LAYLA (whispering) You're not going to like the smell... Amal, narrowing her eyes in confusion, inhales and is hit with the overpowering stench, her face morphing through a series of reactions: confusion to recognition, then to utter dismay. She clamps a hand over her nose and steps back in revulsion. AMAL (disgusted and bewildered) Did you just—oh my God, Layla, did you...? Layla, with cheeks burning, avoids her mother’s gaze; she manages a weak nod and murmurs almost childishly. LAYLA (voice faint) Can I please go in now? Amal, still in shock, steps aside, her interactions with Layla now physically distanced as though she were a bomb about to detonate. CUT TO: LAYLA Gingerly waddling past her mother, hands protecting the mess she’s made, her guilt morphing into sheepish indignation. AMAL (astonished and scolding) You really did it, didn’t you? In your pants like a—ugh! LAYLA (self-righteous) It's your fault, I was fine until you squeezed me! AMAL (incredulously) My fault? Layla, you are not a child! How could you just stand there and—? Layla feigns hurt feelings, her playful deflection barely masking her mortification. LAYLA (playfully sullen) I – I couldn’t help it, you pressed my stomach! She hesitantly pats the bulk, grimacing playfully, then suddenly trying to be matter-of-fact. LAYLA (playful, yet matter-of-fact) It felt good... to let it go, but I am going to clean up now, excuse me. Amal, reaction mingling between disgust and maternal instinct, holds Layla back from escaping the embarrassing scene. AMAL (mocking) You know, only a naughty child takes pleasure in making such a mess! Let me see... She maneuvers around Layla with half-hearted protest from the embarrassed young woman. Amal’s eyes widen at the sight of the bulge at Layla's rear. AMAL (scolding tone) Unbelievable, Layla! All this—how could you...? Layla banters back, an embarrassing honesty in her voice as she describes the sensation, attempting to save some face with humor. LAYLA (coyly) Well, you’re very interested in it, aren’t you? Seems like you want to keep it there! Audible sniffing from Amal followed by a facial cringe speaks volumes. AMAL (infantilizing, scolding tone) If you’re going to act like a baby, I might as well check on this... Oh, the smell! Layla pretends to sniff grandly, then wrinkles her nose in distaste at her own predicament. LAYLA (playful, wry) Terrible, isn’t it? But remember, you’re partly responsible for this stinky situation! With a scoff, Amal ushers her toward the bathroom with clear urgency and a wry smile of disbelief. AMAL (mockingly, but stern) Go clean your stinky self up, right now! Layla begins her awkward waddle down the hallway as Amal waves her hand in front of her face, still reeling from the odor.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to infantilizingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants like she enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments before (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman’s actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman scoffs, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT.

She rubs her eyes, working the latch with sluggish movements. NADIA (desperate) Mom, please, faster! The door swings open to reveal Fatima, her concern growing at the sight of Nadia’s panicked face. FATIMA (concerned) What’s the matter, habibti? Nadia lunges forward, but Fatima instinctively reaches out and grabs her arm, blocking her path. NADIA (squirming) Mom, let go—I need to get past! Fatima tightens her grip, her maternal instincts taking over, while Nadia, on the edge of catastrophe, struggles to break free. FATIMA Honey, you're scaring me. Tell me—what’s wrong? In the tussle, Fatima’s hand presses against Nadia’s abdomen. Nadia’s eyes go wide; a guttural GROAN escapes her lips as the unthinkable happens—she begins to have an accident. Her face scrunches in shock, mixed with a perverse sense of relief. NADIA (uncomfortable grunt) Oh no... Fatima steps back, her confusion palpable. FATIMA Nadia, are you okay, what’s— Nadia’s reply is barely above a whisper, punctuated with strained grunts, indicating undeniable satisfaction. She braces herself on the door frame, still in the grips of her release. NADIA (strained relief) I’m... uh... fine... just give it a second. Fatima’s eyebrows furrow; then her nose wrinkles. She sniffs the air—once, twice—her face contorting with realization and disgust. FATIMA (reluctant accusation) Did you just... did you have an accident? Nadia looks away, shamefaced, and mumbles something inaudible. NADIA (mortified evasion) Can I just—inside, please? Fatima, still in disbelief, steps aside as Nadia, now fully aware of the mess, gingerly holds the seat of her pants and waddles past. FATIMA (scorning disbelief) Nadia, you’re too old for this—it’s all over your pants! Nadia’s shoulders shrink as she tiptoes forward, her shame slowly morphing into playful defensiveness. NADIA (sulkily playful) Well, if you hadn't squeezed me like a toothpaste tube... FATIMA (incredulous) That's no excuse! Look at the mess you've made! Nadia squints back at her mother, with a mix of defiance and embarrassment. NADIA (mischievously) What can I say, Mom, it was pressing. Besides, aren’t you at least a little to blame here? Fatima rolls her eyes and moves closer, demanding to investigate the scale of the disaster. FATIMA (demanding) Show me the damage. Nadia half-heartedly resists, but Fatima circles to survey the extent of the accident, her nose wrinkling again. FATIMA (disgusted astonishment) This is unbelievable, it’s like you’re wearing a diaper! Nadia bickers playfully, her hands wandering nervously to the seat of her leggings, feeling the weight. NADIA (teasingly) Seems like you want me to keep it longer than intended, since cleaning up is taking a back seat here. Fatima leans slightly toward Nadia’s backside, dramatically wafting the air toward her nose, then recoiling theatrically. FATIMA (mocking) Peeyew, you might as well enjoy the stink, kiddo. Nadia gives the air a deliberate sniff and grimaces in exaggerated disgust. NADIA (not-so-serious) Well, it’s definitely a shared experience now, isn’t it? Fatima gives a final scoff, gesturing toward the bathroom insistently. FATIMA (imperious) Go clean up your stinky self, now! With a sigh of resignation mixed with comical exaggeration, Nadia waddles off, her mother fanning her face and following behind, continuing to grumble with affected drama.

Since I don't have the complete codebase and definitions for \`Grid\`, \`Player\`, \`UIManager\`, and \`DayNightCycle\`, I'll provide a high-level overview and some example code to illustrate the changes you might make. 1. **Define a Building Class** First, create a class for the buildings that can be placed on the grid. \`\`\`javascript class Building { constructor(type) { this.type = type; } // Additional methods and properties can be added as needed } \`\`\` 2. **Modify the Grid Class** You may need to modify the \`Grid\` class to keep track of where buildings are placed. Each cell in the grid can contain information about whether there's a building there and what type. 3. **Modify the Game Class** In the \`Game\` class, you want to add methods responsible for handling building placement: \`\`\`javascript class Game { // ... existing code ... placeBuilding(type, x, y) { const building = new Building(type); // Check if the position is valid and not occupied by other objects or buildings if (this.grid.canPlaceBuilding(x, y)) { this.grid.placeBuilding(building, x, y); this.render(); // Rerender the grid to show the new building } else { // Handle the case where the building cannot be placed (maybe show an error to the player) } } // ... existing code ... handleKeyPress(event) { // ... existing code to handle player movement ... // Here you can define specific keys for placing buildings if (event.key === 'b') { // 'b' is an example, choose your appropriate key // Assuming you want to place the building where the player is currently standing: const playerPosition = this.player.getPosition(); this.placeBuilding('YourBuildingType', playerPosition.x, playerPosition.y); } } } \`\`\` 4. **Update the Grid's placeObstacles Method** Ensure that your grid's \`placeObstacles\` method accounts for building placements so that buildings and obstacles don't occupy the same space. 5. **UI Interaction** Adjust your \`UIManager\` if necessary, to include user interface elements for selecting buildings to place and potentially where to place them. If your game allows for mouse input, you could allow users to select grid cells interactively. 6. **Update the Rendering Functionality** Adjust your rendering functionality within the \`Grid\` class to display buildings in addition to other grid elements. Here's a mockup of how you might modify the \`Grid\` class: \`\`\`javascript class Grid { // ... existing code ... canPlaceBuilding(x, y) { // Implement logic to determine if a building can be placed at the x, y coordinates return true; // Placeholder, implement the actual condition checking } placeBuilding(building, x, y) { // Implement logic to place the building on the grid } toString() { // Modify this method to return a string representation of the grid including buildings return ''; // Placeholder } // ... existing code ... } \`\`\` Make sure to fill in the placeholder methods and provide the necessary logic based on the details of your grid representation.

(remaining punch implementation) ... } // ... (remaining punch implementation) ... this.game.render(); } } \`\`\` In this example, the \`rotate\` method allows the player to rotate to a specified direction, updating the facing property. The \`move\` method has been adjusted to update the player's facing direction based on movement. The \`punch\` method now uses only the cell in the direction the player is facing. To include the rotation in your existing \`InputComponent\`, you might need to catch specific keypresses corresponding to rotation and trigger the \`rotate\` method accordingly. Here's an example of how that could look: \`\`\`javascript handleInput(event) { // Example key binds for movement and rotation switch (event.key) { case 'ArrowLeft': this.player.move(-1, 0); break; case 'ArrowRight': this.player.move(1, 0); break; case 'ArrowUp': this.player.move(0, -1); break; case 'ArrowDown': this.player.move(0, 1); break; // Add case for rotation keys (e.g., Q and E for left and right rotation) case 'q': this.player.rotate('left'); // Rotate player to the left break; case 'e': this.player.rotate('right'); // Rotate player to the right break; case ' ': this.player.punch(); // Activate punch action break; // Add other cases as needed for additional actions // ... } } \`\`\` Remember to export any new files or changes and ensure the rest of your game logic integrates smoothly with these new features. Keep in mind that this is a high-level example and the actual implementation may differ based on your game's architecture and other game features."},{"instruction":"add cooldown to the punch so people can't just spam the etner key. The delay should be 1 second","output":"To add a cooldown to the punch action in your game, you can create a cooldown mechanism within the \`Player\` class that tracks the last time the punch action was used. If the action is attempted again before the cooldown period has elapsed, it will be ignored. Here's an adjusted version of your \`Player\` class with a punch cooldown added: \`\`\`javascript class Player { constructor(game, initialX, initialY) { // ... existing properties ... // Property to track the last punch time this.lastPunchTime = 0; this.punchCooldown = 1000; // Cooldown in milliseconds (1 second) // ... remaining constructor code ... } // ... existing methods ... canPunch() { const currentTime = Date.now(); return (currentTime - this.lastPunchTime) >= this.punchCooldown; } punch() { if (this.canPunch()) { this.lastPunchTime = Date.now(); // Set the last punch time to the current time // Define surrounding cells with relative positions based on facing direction // ... (existing punch implementation) ... // After performing punch actions, re-render the game this.game.render(); } } } \`\`\` In the code above, \`lastPunchTime\` tracks when the last punch occurred, and \`punchCooldown\` defines how long the cooldown should last (1 second in this case). The \`canPunch\` method checks whether sufficient time has passed since the last punch. The \`punch\` method uses \`canPunch\` to determine if it is allowed to proceed with the punching action. You can also reflect this cooldown on the UI by disabling the punch button (if there's one) or showing a timer. However, since the \`Player\` class doesn't directly interact with the UI, you should communicate the cooldown state to the \`UIManager\` through a method or directly from within the \`punch\` method: \`\`\`javascript punch() { if (this.canPunch()) { // ... existing punch logic ... // Communicate the cooldown to the UIManager (if necessary) this.game.uiManager.showPunchCooldown(this.punchCooldown); } } \`\`\` Please adjust the UIManager to have a method \`showPunchCooldown\` if you wish to visually indicate cooldown to the player. Finally, the \`InputComponent\` class would remain unchanged since the cooldown logic is handled entirely within the \`Player\` class: \`\`\`javascript handleInput(event) { // ... existing cases for movement ... case ' ': this.player.punch(); // Attempt to punch break; // ... any additional cases ... } \`\`\` Now the player will only be able to punch once every second, preventing them from spamming the action.

This script dispatches a 'mousedown' event immediately to the targeted element, simulating a press of the left mouse button, and then, after a specified delay (2 seconds in this case), it dispatches a 'mouseup' event, simulating a release of the left mouse button. Please note that some browsers or web applications may have security measures in place that either limit the behavior of simulated events or differentiate between user-generated events and script-generated events. Consequently, this may not work in every context, and it's generally not advisable to simulate user input for malicious purposes or to bypass website policies or security mechanisms.

Rather, it is a form of retort that mirrors an insult or argument back to the speaker, essentially equivalent to saying, \\"I know you are, but what am I?\\" This kind of response does not engage with the content of the argument or insult but simply reverses it. In the context of argumentation and logic, the \\"no u\\" retort can be seen as a type of tu quoque fallacy, also known as the appeal to hypocrisy. The tu quoque fallacy occurs when a person avoids addressing the argument or criticism levelled against them by turning it back on the accuser, effectively accusing them of the same thing. For example, if Person A accuses Person B of being dishonest, and Person B responds with \\"no u,\\" they are not addressing the original claim of dishonesty but instead accusing Person A of being dishonest as well. Unlike a formal tu quoque fallacy, which attempts to discredit the opponent by suggesting that their argument is undermined by their own actions or past statements, the \\"no u\\" response is typically used more as a dismissive joke or comeback, and it doesn't necessarily imply any real critique of the original speaker's behavior or argument."},{"instruction":"I have heard that the Oracle from ancient times in Greek / Roman is actually a sophisticated intelligence network","output":"The Oracle referred to is likely the Oracle of Delphi, also known as the Pythia. Located in Delphi, Greece, the oracle was the most prestigious and authoritative oracle among the Greeks, and it played a significant role in Greek culture and decision-making. The Delphic Oracle was established in the 8th century BCE and remained active until the 4th century CE. The Pythia was a priestess who served as the oracle at the Temple of Apollo, and she was believed to deliver prophecies inspired by the god Apollo himself after inhaling fumes from a chasm beneath the temple. Leaders, warriors, and ordinary individuals from all over Greece and beyond would visit the oracle to seek guidance on various matters, from religious rituals to political decisions and personal affairs. While the concept of the Pythia as part of a \\"sophisticated intelligence network\\" is a modern interpretation, there is some historical basis to suggest that the priests who assisted the Pythia may have gathered considerable information from the various visitors to the oracle. The process of consulting the oracle was not straightforward—a visitor would first have to offer gifts and make sacrifices, then they would present their question to the priests who served the Pythia. The priests would interpret and transcribe the Pythia's cryptic responses, and these interpretations could be influenced by their own knowledge or political aims. Given the wide range of visitors, which included influential figures from different city-states, it's reasonable to assume that the priesthood at Delphi could accumulate a vast amount of political and cultural knowledge from across the Greek world. This knowledge could be used to deliver responses that were politically astute or that reflected broader cultural expectations. So, in this sense, one could think of the Oracle of Delphi as a hub of information. However, the idea that it was a \\"sophisticated intelligence network\\" in a modern espionage sense is more speculative and illustrative rather than a description of a structured and deliberate information-gathering operation. The religious and mystical aspects of the oracle were taken seriously by the ancients and were central to its role and influence. The reinterpretation of historical religious institutions as forms of intelligence networks is a common theme in some historical fiction and conspiracy theories but should be viewed with a critical perspective and not taken as historical fact without clear evidence. Ancient institutions like the Delphic Oracle were complex and served multiple roles, including religious, political, and social functions, which may contribute to such modern reinterpretations."},{"instruction":"import SocketHandler from './network/socket'; import KeybindManager from './keybindManager'; import Hud from './hud/hud'; import { Script } from './interfaces'; import { Devtools } from './scripts/general/devtools'; import { Autoanswer } from './scripts/general/autoanswer'; import { Cosmeticpicker } from './scripts/general/cosmeticpicker'; import { Playerhighlighter } from './scripts/general/playerhighlighter'; import { Freecam } from './scripts/general/freecam'; import { Classic } from './scripts/gamemodes/classic'; import { RichMode } from './scripts/gamemodes/superrichmode'; import { TrustNoOne } from './scripts/gamemodes/trustnoone'; import { Instantuse } from './scripts/general/instantuse'; import { Instapurchasers } from './scripts/gamemodes/purchasers'; import { Farmchain } from './scripts/gamemodes/farmchain'; import { HideEnergy } from './scripts/general/hideenergy'; import { Spawner } from './scripts/general/spawner'; import { Lava } from './scripts/gamemodes/floorislava'; // import { BotCreator } from './scripts/general/botcreator'; class Cheat extends EventTarget { socketHandler: SocketHandler; keybindManager: KeybindManager = new KeybindManager(); hud: Hud; funcs: Map<string, Function> = new Map(); scripts: Script[] = []; gameId: string = \\"\\"; constructor() { super(); // add cheat to the global scope (window as any).cheat = this; this.socketHandler = new SocketHandler(this); this.socketHandler.addEventListener(\\"socket\\", (e) => { cheat.log(\\"Socket connected\\", e) }) this.socketHandler.getSocket(); this.hud = new Hud(this); // initialize any scripts this.scripts = [ Devtools(), Instantuse(), Autoanswer(), Cosmeticpicker(), Playerhighlighter(), Freecam(), HideEnergy(), Spawner(), Classic(), RichMode(), TrustNoOne(), Farmchain(), Instapurchasers(), Lava() // BotCreator() ] this.initScripts(); this.setupCodeExtraction(); this.waitForLoad(); } waitForLoad() { // colyseus exclusive let loadInterval = setInterval(() => { let loadedData = (unsafeWindow as any)?.stores?.loading let loaded = loadedData?.percentageAssetsLoaded >= 100 && loadedData?.completedInitialLoad && loadedData?.loadedInitialDevices && loadedData?.loadedInitialTerrain if(!loaded) return; // check whether we've been assigned to a team let team = (unsafeWindow as any)?.stores?.phaser?.mainCharacter?.teamId if(team == \\"__NO_TEAM_ID\\") return clearInterval(loadInterval) this.log(\\"Game Loaded\\") this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\\"gameLoaded\\")) }, 1000 / 60) // TODO: Add blueboat load detection } initScripts() { for(let script of this.scripts) { // add functions if(script.funcs) { for(let [name, func] of script.funcs) { this.funcs.set(name, func); } } // add hud additions if(script.hudAddition) { this.hud.loadFromObject(script.hudAddition); } // initialize the script if(script.init) { script.init(this); } } } antifreeze() { let nativeFreeze = Object.freeze Object.freeze = (obj: any) => { if(obj.constructor?.name == \\"WebSocket\\" || obj.name == \\"WebSocket\\") return obj return nativeFreeze(obj) } // ignore any attempts to modify WebSocket.prototype.send var originalSend = WebSocket.prototype.send; Object.defineProperty(WebSocket.prototype, 'send', { configurable: false, enumerable: false, get: function () { return originalSend; }, set: function (value) { if (value === originalSend) { return; // allow setting to the original value } console.log(\\"Attempted to modify WebSocket.prototype.send\\") } }); } log(...args: any[]) { console.log(\\"[GC]\\", ...args); } setupCodeExtraction() { let nativeSend = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send; let cheat = this; XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function(...params: any[]) { this.addEventListener(\\"load\\", () => { if(this.responseURL.endsWith('/find-info-from-code')) { cheat.gameId = JSON.parse(params[0]).code; cheat.log(\\"Game ID:\\", cheat.gameId); } }, { once: true }) // @ts-ignore can't be bothered to fix this nativeSend.apply(this, params); } } getScript(name: string) { for(let script of this.scripts) { if(script.name == name) return script; } return null; } } const cheat = new Cheat(); export default cheat Optimize and improve this code, and turn it into js","output":"To optimize and convert the provided TypeScript code into JavaScript, I'll perform a few changes: 1.

Remember to transpile and/or test this code if you plan to support environments that do not yet have full ES6 support."},{"instruction":"optimize and improve the code, use the latest es features, and make it more compact, scalable, and maintainable","output":"To further optimize and compact the code, we can use various ES6+ features for more concise syntax and improved readability. Some improvements include using arrow functions for simpler function expressions, destructuring assignments for easier access to object properties, class fields for initializing properties, and more informative logging.

Arrow functions are used, which offer a more concise syntax and lexically bind \`this\`. 2. Class field declarations initialize instance variables. 3. The \`waitForLoad\`, \`initScripts\`, \`antifreeze\`, and \`setupCodeExtraction\` methods are now arrow functions that will maintain the correct \`this\` context when they are used as callbacks. 4. Destructuring is used to unpack values from objects, which makes the code more readable. 5. The \`logEvent\` method has been converted to return a logging function tailored with a specific message, making adding log events more streamlined. 6. Using \`Object.values()\` allows for iterating over scripts imported as modules directly. 7. The \`XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send\` and \`Object.freeze\` hacks now provide more informative console warnings and include error handling. 8. The constructor instantiates all the scripts and saves them in the \`scripts\` array. 9. Removed redundant properties initialization and methods that already existed within the imported modules. Remember to thoroughly test the refactored class. While the new ES6+ features should enhance readability and conciseness, each modification can introduce unforeseen issues. Make sure that importing scripts from modules matches the module structure you've established in \`./scripts/general\` and \`./scripts/gamemodes\`."},{"instruction":"modify the logic so that its easier professional and makes more sense. For example, the loading of scripts doesn't entirely make sense, perhaps we use something else?","output":"To make the logic of loading and initializing scripts more professional and easier to understand, we can streamline the script management by defining a clear structure for scripts and their lifecycle. We'll define a ScriptManager to handle the instantiation, initialization, and management of scripts, abstracting the complexity away from the main Cheat class. Here's a refined approach with a ScriptManager class that enhances modularity, clarity, and maintainability: \`\`\`javascript // Import the necessary modules import SocketHandler from './network/socket'; import KeybindManager from './keybindManager'; import Hud from './hud/hud'; import * as GeneralScripts from './scripts/general'; import * as GameModeScripts from './scripts/gamemodes'; // Define a ScriptManager class class ScriptManager { constructor(cheatInstance) { this.cheat = cheatInstance; this.scripts = this.loadScripts(); } loadScripts() { // Combine scripts from different categories and instantiate them const scriptClasses = [ ...Object.values(GeneralScripts), ...Object.values(GameModeScripts), ]; return scriptClasses.map(ScriptClass => new ScriptClass(this.cheat)); } initScripts() { // Call init on each script if available this.scripts.forEach(script => script.init?.()); } getScript(name) { // Find a script by its name return this.scripts.find(script => script.name === name); } } class Cheat extends EventTarget { socketHandler = new SocketHandler(this); keybindManager = new KeybindManager(); hud = new Hud(this); scriptManager = new ScriptManager(this); gameId = \\"\\"; constructor() { super(); window.cheat = this; this.socketHandler.addEventListener(\\"socket\\", this.logEvent(\\"Socket connected\\")); this.scriptManager.initScripts(); this.setupCodeExtraction(); this.waitForLoad(); } log = (message, ...args) => console.log(\`[GC] {message}\`, ...args); logEvent = (message) => (event) => this.log(\`{message}:\`, event); waitForLoad = () => { // ... existing logic ... }; antifreeze = () => { // ... existing logic ... }; setupCodeExtraction = () => { // ... existing logic ... }; } export default new Cheat(); \`\`\` Changes made in the above code: 1. A \`ScriptManager\` class is defined to handle the loading and initialization of scripts, promoting separation of concerns. 2. The \`loadScripts\` method within the \`ScriptManager\` combines general and game mode scripts, automating script registration. 3. \`initScripts\` in \`ScriptManager\` encapsulates the logic for script initialization and ensures each script's \`init\` method is called. 4. \`ScriptManager\` is instantiated within the \`Cheat\` class, and its methods are called to manage the scripts, simplifying the Cheat class's responsibility. 5. The \`Cheat\` class now focuses on setting up event listeners, waiting for game loading, anti-tampering measures, and setting up code extraction. 6. The \`log\` and \`logEvent\` methods in \`Cheat\` provide consistent logging for debugging and tracking. This approach provides clear responsibilities to each class—Cheat serves as the primary controller and interface, while ScriptManager is the custodian of scripts. Such separation allows you to add new scripts or change the loading logic without disrupting the functionality of the Cheat class. Please note that part of the Cheat class, such as \`waitForLoad\`, \`antifreeze\`, and \`setupCodeExtraction\` methods, have been abbreviated with comments. This is to focus on the structural changes around script management; you should fill these in with the existing logic as needed. By encapsulating script management, the Cheat class is more compact, focused solely on interfacing with the cheat's functions and the broader game environment, while the ScriptManager takes on the responsibility of script lifecycle management, making it easier to maintain and scale."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It seems you want to translate a text to English, but you haven't provided any text to translate.

[우호영! 달립니다!] 죽을힘을 다해 뛰는 것도 그 때문이었다. 호영의 시선이 전방 깊숙한 곳으로 떨어졌다. 수비 숫자는 넷. 중앙 수비수 알베르토 로포와 제 카스트로가 최종수비라인을 담당하며 벤제마를 맡고 있었고, 그 위에 후안 로드리게스와 주카가 1차 저지선을 구축하고 있었다. 좌우 풀백은 호날두와 로벤의 질주를 따라잡느라 정신이 없었다. 따라서 호영은. ‘정면.’ 그 한가운데로 질주했다. 실책을 범한 필리페 루이스가 전속력으로 붙어봤지만 차이는 더더욱 벌어질 뿐이었다. 달리기에 아무리 일가견이 있는 선수라도, 호영의 탄탄한 허벅지에서 뿜어져 나오는 에너지는 따라잡을 수 있는 수준이 아니었다. “망할.” 루이스는 얼굴이 새파랗게 질려서는 얼마 따라가 보지도 못하고 방향을 바꾸었다. 이미 가속도가 붙은 우호영을 마크한다는 것은 사실상 불가능해보였기 때문이다. ‘미친.’ 그러고는 고개를 절레 저었다. 빠르다고만 알고 있었지, 저렇게 빠를 줄은 몰랐으니까. 믿을 건 골키퍼밖에 없어보였다. 상황은 빠르게 전개되었다. 공을 받은 사비 알론소가 전방 깊숙한 곳으로 패스를 찔러 넣었다. 알베르토 로포와 제 카스트로의 사이를 정확히 가로지르는 패스였다. [페널티 에어리어로 쭉 뻗어나갑니다! 패스가 살짝 긴 것 같은데요!] [일단 우호영이 전속력을 향해 달려가 봅니다!] 패스가 살짝 길어보이긴 했다. 하지만 그것이 바로 사비 알론소의 노림수였다. 우호영이라면 수비수들을 완전히 따돌리고 공을 잡을 수 있을 거라고 생각했으니까. 그리고. 타악! [알론소의 패스가 우호영의 발끝에 딱 맞게 걸칩니다!] 과연 타의 추종을 불허하는 ‘대지를 가르는 패스’의 장인답게, 알론소는 단 한 번의 패스만으로 완벽한 상황을 만들어냈다. 거기에 더해. [우호영의 환상적인 퍼스트 터치!] 호영은 마치 손으로 잡아끈 것처럼, 공을 자신의 발아래로 잽싸게 가져왔다. 남은 것은 골키퍼였다. [골키퍼와의 일대일 찬스! 동시에 다니엘 아란수비아가 뛰어나옵니다!] “후읍.” 문전 앞. 호영은 한바탕 숨을 들이키며 정신을 집중시켰다. 골키퍼 다니엘 아란수비아(Daniel Aranzubia)가 인상을 짓구긴 채 헐레벌떡 뛰어나와봤지만, 호영의 얼굴은 한없이 평온했다. 천재지변이 일어나지 않는 이상 무조건 득점에 성공시킬 것 같은 모습이었다. 더욱이 그 바로 옆에 동료 선수 하나가 노마크 찬스로 있었기에, 그야말로 완벽한 득점찬스나 다름없었다. 찰나 호영의 시선이 그쪽으로 향했다. 어서 패스를 내어달라고 손짓하는 벤제마의 모습이 보였다. 아주 짧은 찰나 둘의 눈이 허공에서 맞부딪혔다. 그쪽으로 패스를 하는 게 득점확률이 훨씬 더 높을 터였다. 하지만. 투욱. 공은 이미 호영의 발끝을 떠난 뒤였다. 보지 않고도 안정적으로 찰 수 있는 이것이 바로 경지에 이른 볼 감각. 호영이 툭 찍어 찬 공은, 포물선을 그리며 날아가 골키퍼의 키를 넘겼다. 순간 다니엘 아란수비아와 카림 벤제마의 얼굴이 동시에 구겨졌다. 그리고 골대는 가볍게 출렁였다. [고오오오오오오올! 우호영의 시즌 1호골이 터집니다!] [마지막에 살짝 고개를 돌려서 패스를 할 줄 알았는데, 거기서 로빙슛으로 해결을 하네요. 놀랍습니다. 강심장이 아니고서는 엄두도 못 낼 과감한 플레이였어요. 골키퍼를 심리전에서 압도했다고 볼 수 있죠.] 관중석은 난리도 아니었다. WHY를 외치는 뜨거운 목소리가 필드 위로 쏟아져 나오고, 서포터즈 석에서는 북소리가 울려 펴지고 있었다. 호영은 그 함성을 한 몸에 받으며 사비 알론소에게 달려갔다. 둘은 가벼운 포옹을 나누며 득점을 자축했다. 평소 말이 거의 없을 정도로 점잖은 성격의 사비 알론소는, 싱긋 웃으며 엄지를 치켜세워주었다. 그로서는 감회가 남다른 경험이었다. ‘역시 믿음을 저버리지 않아.’ 팀에 합류한지 얼마 되지도 않은 그는 벌써부터 호영을 신뢰하고 있었다. 리버풀에서 제라드-토레스 라인과 합을 맞췄던 그로서도 처음 느껴보는 기분이었다. 어쩌면 레알 마드리드에서 모든 것을 이룰 수 있을지도 모르겠다는 생각마저 들었다. 전반전이 2대0으로 끝난 뒤. 선수들은 기분 좋은 모습으로 라커룸으로 돌아왔다. 헌데 유독 어울리지 못하고 구석에 혼자 쭈그린 채 앉아있는 사람이 있었다. ‘제기랄.’ 모든 것을 망쳐버린 카림 벤제마였다. 어시스트를 할 수 있는 기회를 실책으로 날렸고, 그 실책을 우호영이 살려서 그대로 골을 집어넣었다. 지금쯤 각 언론사들은 ‘벤제마가 싼 똥을 치워주는 우호영’과 같은 자극적인 기사를 작성하고 있을 것이 분명했다. 그야말로 최악의 데뷔전. 오늘은 더 이상 경기장에 나가고 싶지 않았다. 프랑스에 있는 부모님에게 데뷔 골을 넣겠다고 큰소리 뻥뻥 쳐댔는데 꼴이 말이 아니었다. 동료들로부터 따가운 시선이 느껴지는 것은 당연한 일이었다. ‘제대로 망신살이군. 열여섯밖에 되지 않은 꼬맹이한테 도움이나 받는 처지라니.’ 아까 그건 순전히 자신의 잘못이 맞았다. 그나마 우호영이 환상적인 골을 넣어줘서 자신의 실책이 가려진 것이지, 그게 아니었더라면 팬들에게 된통 욕을 얻어먹었을 것이다. 그리고 이제는 조금 알 것 같았다. 어째서 스콜라리가 교체 전에 그런 말을 했던 것인지. ‘축구를 어떻게 그렇게 하는 거지?’ 의문이 맴돌았다. 실전에서 느껴본 우호영은 마치 두 사람 그 이상이 한 몸이 되어 뛰는 것 같았다. 자신의 강점을 활용하는 것뿐만 아니라, 선수들의 부족한 점까지 메우면서 경기장 반코트를 혼자 커버하였다. 경기장에서 같이 뛰어보니 여실히 느껴졌다.","output":"206. The Difference in Level (2) Benzema's greed and jealousy. Ho-young had no certainty, but he had somewhat noticed it. Ever since he joined the team, he had continuously felt it. Especially when Scolari was away from the training ground, Benzema would often loiter around and sneer. Ho-young had thought about confronting him directly in a nerve-wracking exchange, but he couldn't. Every time, Marcelo, Ramos, and Pepe were the first to step up and hurl insults at Benzema. Moreover, as the team's mainstay, Ho-young couldn't act rashly. If he insulted the French faction, it would only strengthen the Spanish faction and form a more serious factional divide. With the team's spiritual pillar, Raul, and Guti already biased to one side, someone was needed to firmly hold the center of the team and sort out the situation. That person was Ho-young. In fact, the French faction didn't dislike Ho-young at all. It was only Benzema, whose position overlapped with Ho-young's, who felt that way; Lassana Diarra, Mamadou Sakho, and Yoann Gourcuff actually liked and respected Ho-young. In such a situation, Ho-young wanted to unite the two teams. That was why he had covered for Benzema's mistake. In reality, if he had allowed Filipe Luís to break through and concede a goal, all the blame would have turned to Benzema. He could have made it happen if he wanted to. But that wasn't Ho-young's way. The field is not a political arena, and soccer is not about politicking. The reason for running is to kick the ball, and kicking the ball is to beat the opponent. And for oneself. For the fans who support him. At least, that's what Ho-young thought. He had learned that from Kaka and Zinedine Zidane. So now. Thump! [Ho-young is running!] He ran with all his might for that reason. Ho-young's gaze fell deep ahead. There were four defenders. Central defenders Alberto Lopo and Xé Castro were in charge of the last defensive line, marking Benzema, with Juan Rodríguez and Juka forming the first line of defense above them. The fullbacks on both sides were too busy catching up with the sprints of Ronaldo and Robben. Therefore, Ho-young. 'Straight ahead.' He sprinted right through the middle. Filipe Luís, who had made the mistake, tried to keep up at full speed, but the gap only widened. No matter how good a runner a player was, the energy bursting from Ho-young's solid thighs was not something they could catch up to. \\"Damn.\\" Luís turned pale and changed direction without being able to follow for long, as it seemed virtually impossible to mark the already accelerating Ho-young. 'Crazy.' He shook his head. He knew Ho-young was fast, but he didn't know he was that fast. The only thing to trust was the goalkeeper. The situation unfolded quickly. Xabi Alonso received the ball and stabbed a pass deep forward. It was a pass that precisely cut through the space between Alberto Lopo and Xé Castro. [The ball stretches out into the penalty area! The pass seems a bit long!] [First, Ho-young sprints at full speed!] The pass did seem a bit long. But that was exactly what Xabi Alonso was aiming for. He thought that Ho-young could completely outpace the defenders and catch the ball. And then. Thump! [Xabi Alonso's pass perfectly meets Ho-young's feet!] True to the master of the 'ground-splitting pass,' Alonso created a perfect situation with just one pass. Adding to that. [Ho-young's fantastic first touch!] Ho-young quickly brought the ball under his feet as if he had grabbed it with his hand. What remained was the goalkeeper. [A one-on-one chance with the goalkeeper! At the same time, Daniel Aranzubia rushes out!] \\"Huff.\\" In front of the goal. Ho-young took a deep breath and focused his mind. Goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia grimaced and rushed out, but Ho-young's face was utterly calm. Unless a natural disaster occurred, it seemed he would definitely score. Moreover, right next to him, a teammate was unmarked, presenting a perfect scoring chance. For a moment, Ho-young's gaze turned in that direction. He saw Benzema gesturing for a pass. Their eyes briefly met in the air. Passing the ball in that direction would have been much more likely to result in a goal. But. Flick. The ball had already left Ho-young's feet. This ability to kick the ball accurately without looking is precisely the sense of the ball that comes with mastery. The ball kicked by Ho-young drew a parabola over the goalkeeper's head. In an instant, the faces of Daniel Aranzubia and Karim Benzema both crumpled. And the goalpost lightly swayed. [Goal! Ho-young's first goal of the season!] [At the last moment, I thought he would turn his head and pass, but he solved it with a lob shot. It's amazing. It was a bold play that only someone with a strong heart could dare. He overwhelmed the goalkeeper in a psychological battle.] The stands were in an uproar. Hot voices shouting \\"WHY\\" poured onto the field, and the sound of drums echoed from the supporters' section. Ho-young received the cheers and ran to Xabi Alonso. The two exchanged a light hug and celebrated the goal. Xabi Alonso, usually so reserved he hardly spoke, smiled and gave a thumbs-up. It was a particularly memorable experience for him. 'As expected, he didn't let me down.' Having joined the team not long ago, he already trusted Ho-young. Even for him, who had matched the Gerrard-Torres line at Liverpool, it was a feeling he had never experienced before. He even began to think that maybe he could achieve everything at Real Madrid. After the first half ended 2-0. The players returned to the locker room in high spirits. But there was one person who sat alone in a corner, not fitting in. 'Damn it.' It was Karim Benzema, who had ruined everything. He had missed the opportunity to assist and Ho-young had saved his mistake and scored a goal. By now, the media would surely be writing provocative articles like \\"Ho-young cleaning up Benzema's mess.\\" It was the worst debut. He didn't want to go back on the field anymore today. He had bragged to his parents in France that he would score a debut goal, but the situation was a mess. It was natural to feel the harsh stares from his teammates. 'I've completely embarrassed myself. To be in a position where I need help from a mere sixteen-year-old kid.' That was indeed his fault. At least Ho-young scored a fantastic goal, covering up his mistake, otherwise, he would have been severely scolded by the fans. And now he began to understand a little. Why Scolari had said those words before the substitution. 'How can you play soccer like that?' The question lingered. Having played with Ho-young in a real game, it felt as if two or more people had become one body and were running together. Not only did he utilize his strengths, but he also covered for the players' weaknesses, managing half the field alone. Having played together on the field, the difference was clearly felt."},{"instruction":"208. 졸업 그리고 본격적인 시작(2) 화제가 된 것은 모니카의 졸업식만이 아니었다. 그로부터 며칠 뒤 벌어진 호영의 졸업식 때는 화제성이 몇 배나 더 높았다. 호영의 모습을 보려고 기자들부터 시작해서 마드리드의 시민들까지 우루루 몰려와 학교를 완전히 둘러싼 것이었다. 이를 예상한 학교 측은, 아예 졸업식 참석자 명단을 만들어 입구에서 철저한 검사를 통해 사람들을 들여보냈다. 그게 미안했던 호영은 졸업식 참석자 전원에게 자신의 유니폼을 선물하기로 하였다. 그래봤자 4일치 봉급밖에 되지 않는 수준이었기에 큰 부담은 없었다. 이윽고 호영을 태운 고급세단이 학교 정문으로 들어서자, 수많은 인파가 차를 에워싸며 소리를 질러대기 시작했다. “축하합니다!” “우오오오오오오!” “우호영이다!” 거기서 끝이 아니었다. 잇따라 아우디(Audi)의 고급 차들이 줄지어 들어오더니 하나둘씩 창문 밖으로 손을 흔들어댔다. 라모스, 페페, 카시야스, 구티, 라울, 마르셀루, 마하마두 디아라, 가고, 로벤 등 레알 마드리드의 수많은 선수들이 학교를 찾은 것이었다. 웬만해서는 보기 힘든 이색적인 풍경이었다. 하지만 놀랄만한 일은 아직도 더 남아있었다. 이윽고 검은색 차량이 들어서자 도시가 떠나갈 듯 난리가 났다. 이번에도 역시, 레알 마드리드의 공식스폰서 아우디의 해치백 모델이었는데, 그것은 지단의 애마로 널리 알려져 있었다. 아니나 다를까 그 안에 타고 있던 사람은 지단이었다. 이윽고 졸업식장 안으로 들어선 지단은 호영에게 꽃다발을 전해주며 포옹을 나눴다. “휴가 가신 거 아니었어요?” “그래도 여긴 참석해야지. 다른 사람도 아니고 네 졸업식인데.” “아···.” 참석자 명단에 지단의 이름을 기입하긴 했지만 정말 올 줄은 몰랐다. 그는 이틀 전 휴가를 떠났었기 때문이다. “감사합니다.” 호영은 감격스러웠다. 이렇게나 멋있는 사내와 이런 관계를 가질 수 있다는 현실이 새삼 감사하게 느껴졌다. 다른 선수들도 마찬가지였다. 황금 같은 개인시간을 비워서 아침 일찍부터 찾아와준 것은 매우 감사할 일이었다. 가슴이 뭉클해진 호영은 한 명씩 뜨거운 포옹을 나누고 싶었다. 하지만 사나이끼리 무슨 할 말이 필요한가. 이 짜릿한 순간을 즐기면 그만이었다. “워어어어어! 영(Young)이 벌써 졸업을 하다니. 세월 참 빠르다. 좀만 더 있으면 이젠 차까지 몰고 다니겠어.” “큭큭. 졸업 축하한다.” 어느새 머리를 꽤 많이 기른 마르셀루와 페페를 시작으로 덕담이 이어졌다. 다음 차례는 라울이었다. “아직 졸업식이 끝난 건 아니지만 미리 졸업 축하한다. 이제 훈련에 더 집중할 수 있겠구나.” “감사합니다. 앞으론 더 열심히 해야죠.” 라울과 악수를 나누자, 이번엔 반 니스텔루이와 로벤이 동시에 나타났다. “오늘부턴 자유의 몸이네. 그래도 좀 허전하겠어. 뭐··· 정 그러면 그 시간에 로벤의 머리나 좀 두들겨주는 것도 괜찮지. 요즘 탈모마사지 받으러 다닌다고 하던데.” “저 멀대같은 자식. 탈모마사지가 아니라 두피마사지다. 그리고 호영, 졸업 축하해.” “하하하. 모두 감사합니다.” 둘의 장난스런 대화는 로벤이 주먹질을 휘두르는 것으로 끝났다. 그리고 농담 따먹기에는 라모스가 빠질 수 없었다. “우리 꼬맹이가 언제 이렇게 컸대. 이제 계산기 안 두드려도 되겠네?” “대신 각도기를 들고 다녀야겠죠.” “경기장에서 슈팅각도 재려고?” “아니, 당신 때리려고.” “하하하하!” 왁자지껄한 모습에 주변 졸업생들과 참석자들의 시선이 이쪽으로 몰렸다. 부러움의 눈빛이 끊이질 않았다. 그런 와중에 한 소녀가 나타나면서 웅성거리는 목소리가 실내를 가득 채웠다. “오우, 그런데 저 아리따운 여성분은 누구셔? 어제 뉴스에서 본 것 같은데······.” 라모스의 물음에 호영이 단호하게 말했다. “제 여자친구에요.” 호영의 조부모와 함께 모니카까지 도착하자 선수들은 다시금 흥분에 도가니에 휩싸였다. 일제히 모니카에게 질문공세를 퍼붓기 시작했다. 언제 만났나는 둥, 어떻게 만났냐는 둥, 학생이냐는 둥. 이러다가 호구조사까지 할 기세였다. 한편 호영의 할아버지 김재겸은 지단과 라울을 붙잡고 수다를 떠느라 정신이 없었다. 졸업식은 그러는 사이 시작되었다. 직후 호영이 졸업생석으로 들어가려는 찰나였다. “이봐.” 뒤쪽에서 울려 퍼진 굵직한 목소리. 이상한 청바지에 요상한 빨간색 브이넥을 입고 온 사내의 목소리였다. 거기에다가 얇은 진주목걸이에 흰 벨트로 포인트를 주고 온 그는, 머쓱한 듯 머리를 긁적이며 악수를 건넸다. 그리고 잠깐의 정적. 남자는 말을 뗐다. “······ 지나가다 들렸다. 졸업 축하한다.” “찾아와주셔서 감사합니다.” 호영은 환하게 웃으며 그를 맞이했다. 전혀 예상치도 못했던 그의 방문은 분명 최고의 선물이었다. 개인사정 때문에 참석하지 못한 선수를 제외하고, 정말 가기 싫어서 참석하지 않은 이가 한 명 있었다. 집 거실소파에 누워서 핸드폰을 만지작거리고 있던 카림 벤제마였다. “염병들 하고 있네. 16살짜리 졸업식에나 가서 시시덕거리고 있고.” 벤제마가 화난 이유는 단순했다. 라모스와 아르벨로아가 페이스북에 올린 졸업식 영상을 지켜보다가 괜히 소외감이 들고 또 심술이 났던 것이다. ‘감독님도 아니고 뭐 잘 보일 게 있다고 저길 가?’ 무엇보다 자존심이 허락하지 않아서 찾아가지 않았던 것인데, 저렇게 많은 사람들이 갈 줄은 몰랐다. 그래도 위안 삼을 거리라도 있어서 다행이었다. ‘그 녀석은 안 갔겠지. 자존심이 센 녀석이니까.’ 벤제마는 크리스티아누 호날두에게 문자메시지 한 통을 보냈다. [헤이, 크리스. 시시한 애들은 내버려두고 우리 집에서 맥주나 한 잔 하자.] 우호영이나 그나 재수 없는 건 매한가지였지만, 그나마 같은 유럽인이라서 그런지 호날두가 좀 더 가깝게 느껴졌다. 그리고 한 30분 정도 있으니 기다리던 문자가 왔다. [나 졸업식장인데? 그리고 나 술 안 마셔.] “이런 시시한 녀석들!” 쾅! “으, 흑······.” 벤제마는 격분한 나머지 발을 뻗다가 탁자를 치고 말았다. 고통은 잠시였지만 눈물이 핑 돌 것 같았다. 그렇게 꿈꾸던 레알 마드리드에 와서 제대로 풀리는 일이 하나도 없었다. 여기 있다가는 평생 뒤치다꺼리만 할 것 같다는 불길한 예감이 들었다. * * * 9월은 챔피언스 리그가 시작된 달이었다. 가장 쉬운 C조에 속한 레알 마드리드는, 취리히와 마르세유를 연달아 잡으며 기분 좋은 스타트를 끊었다. 10월에는 보르도(Bordeaux)와 무승부를 기록했지만, 여전히 1위의 자리를 굳건히 지켜나갈 수 있었다. 리그 성적도 매우 좋았다. 중간에 세비야에게 패배를 내어주긴 했지만, 8승을 확보하며 쾌조의 출발을 가져갔다. 한편 바르셀로나도 만만치 않았다. 총 1500억 가량을 투입하여 즐라탄 이브라히모비치와 막스웰, 케이히송, 치크린스키 등을 영입한 그들은, 7승 2무를 기록하며 리그 2등에 올라있었다. 그리고 양 팀은 11월 29일에 펼쳐질 엘 클라시코 준비에 돌입하였다. 하지만 그중 한 팀에 악재가 연달아 터졌다. 바로 레알 마드리드였다. “젠장.” 산티아고 베르나베우의 회장실. 늦은 밤, 긴급하게 모인 다섯 명의 고위인사는 제 하나 같이 심각한 얼굴을 짓고 있었다. 사무총장, 부회장, 단장, 기술이사 그리고 칼데론 회장까지.","output":"208. Graduation and the Real Start (2) It wasn't just Monica's graduation ceremony that became a topic of conversation. A few days later, when Ho-young's graduation ceremony took place, the buzz was several times greater. From journalists to the citizens of Madrid, crowds flocked to the school, completely surrounding it. Anticipating this, the school created a list of attendees for the graduation ceremony and conducted thorough checks at the entrance to let people in. Feeling sorry about the situation, Ho-young decided to gift his jersey to all the attendees of the graduation ceremony. Since it was only the equivalent of four days' wages, it wasn't a big burden for him. As the luxury sedan carrying Ho-young entered the school's main gate, a multitude of people surrounded the car and began to shout. \\"Congratulations!\\" \\"Woahhhhh!\\" \\"It's Ho-young!\\" But that wasn't the end. One after another, luxury Audi cars lined up and entered, with the occupants waving their hands out the windows. Ramos, Pepe, Casillas, Guti, Raul, Marcelo, Mahamadou Diarra, Gago, Robben, and many other Real Madrid players had come to the school. It was a rare and unusual sight to see. Yet, there was still more surprising news to come. When a black car arrived, the city erupted into chaos. Again, it was an Audi hatchback model, the official sponsor of Real Madrid, and it was widely known as Zidane's favorite car. Sure enough, the person inside was Zidane. Zidane entered the graduation hall and handed Ho-young a bouquet of flowers, sharing a hug with him. \\"Weren't you on vacation?\\" \\"I had to attend this. It's not just anyone's graduation, it's yours.\\" \\"Ah...\\" Ho-young had put Zidane's name on the attendee list, but he didn't really expect him to come since he had left for vacation two days ago. \\"Thank you.\\" Ho-young was moved. He felt grateful for the reality of having such a cool relationship with such an amazing man. The other players felt the same. It was very kind of them to take time out of their precious personal schedules to come early in the morning. With a heart full of emotion, Ho-young wanted to share a warm hug with each of them. But what need was there for words between men? It was enough to enjoy this thrilling moment. \\"Wowwww! Young is already graduating. Time flies so fast. Soon you'll be driving around in your own car.\\" \\"Heh heh. Congratulations on your graduation.\\" Starting with Marcelo and Pepe, who had grown their hair quite a bit, the well-wishes continued. Next up was Raul. \\"The ceremony isn't over yet, but congratulations on your graduation in advance. Now you can focus more on training.\\" \\"Thank you. I'll have to work even harder from now on.\\" After shaking hands with Raul, Van Nistelrooy and Robben appeared together. \\"From today, you're a free man. But it might feel a bit empty. Well... if that's the case, you could spend that time knocking on Robben's head. I heard he's been going for hair loss massages these days.\\" \\"That beanpole. It's not a hair loss massage, it's a scalp massage. And Ho-young, congratulations on your graduation.\\" \\"Hahaha. Thank you, everyone.\\" Their playful conversation ended with Robben swinging his fist. And Ramos couldn't miss out on the banter. \\"Our little guy has grown up so fast. Now you don't need to tap on a calculator anymore?\\" \\"Instead, I'll have to carry around a protractor.\\" \\"To measure the shooting angle on the field?\\" \\"No, to hit you with it.\\" \\"Hahahaha!\\" The boisterous scene drew the attention of the surrounding graduates and attendees. Envious glances were unending. Amidst this, a girl appeared, and murmurs filled the room. \\"Wow, but who is that beautiful lady? I think I saw her on the news yesterday...\\" At Ramos's question, Ho-young firmly replied. \\"She's my girlfriend.\\" As Ho-young's grandparents and Monica arrived, the players were once again engulfed in excitement. They began to bombard Monica with a barrage of questions. When did they meet, how did they meet, was she a student? It was as if they were about to conduct a census. Meanwhile, Ho-young's grandfather, Kim Jae-kyum, was busy chatting with Zidane and Raul. The graduation ceremony began amidst all this. Just as Ho-young was about to enter the graduates' seats. \\"Hey.\\" A deep voice echoed from behind. It was the voice of a man who had come in strange jeans and a peculiar red V-neck, with a thin pearl necklace and a white belt as an accent, scratching his head awkwardly as he offered a handshake. Then, a moment of silence. The man spoke. \\"...I just stopped by. Congratulations on your graduation.\\" \\"Thank you for coming.\\" Ho-young greeted him with a bright smile. The unexpected visit from him was certainly the best gift. Excluding the player who couldn't attend due to personal reasons, there was one person who didn't attend simply because he didn't want to. It was Karim Benzema, who was lying on the living room sofa, fiddling with his phone. \\"These idiots. Going to fuss over a 16-year-old's graduation.\\" Benzema was angry for a simple reason. He had watched the graduation ceremony video posted by Ramos and Arbeloa on Facebook and felt left out and spiteful. 'Why would the coach go there to show off?' Above all, his pride wouldn't allow him to go, but he didn't expect so many people to attend. At least there was some consolation. 'That guy wouldn't have gone. He's too proud.' Benzema sent a text message to Cristiano Ronaldo. [Hey, Cris. Let's leave the petty kids alone and have a beer at my place.] Both Ho-young and Ronaldo were equally annoying, but perhaps because they were both Europeans, Ronaldo felt a bit closer. And after about 30 minutes, the awaited text arrived. [I'm at the graduation ceremony? And I don't drink.] \\"These petty guys!\\" Bang! \\"Uh, ugh...\\" Benzema, in a fit of rage, stretched out his leg and hit the table. The pain was brief, but it felt like tears were about to come. Nothing had gone right since he had come to Real Madrid, the team of his dreams. He had a bad feeling that if he stayed here, he would spend his life just cleaning up after others. * * * September was the month when the Champions League began. Real Madrid, in the easiest Group C, had a good start by defeating Zurich and Marseille in succession. In October, they drew with Bordeaux but were still able to firmly maintain their first-place position. Their league performance was also very good. Although they lost to Sevilla in between, they secured 8 wins and had a great start. On the other hand, Barcelona was not to be underestimated. Having invested around 150 billion to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Maxwell, Keirrison, and Chygrynskiy, they recorded 7 wins and 2 draws, ranking second in the league. And both teams began preparing for El Clasico, which would take place on November 29th. However, one of the teams faced a series of bad news. It was Real Madrid. \\"Damn.\\" In the chairman's office of Santiago Bernabeu. Late at night, five senior officials gathered urgently, each with a serious expression on their faces.

BAND MEMBER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The scene opens with the band, “The Electric Keynotes,” spread out in a cozy, untidy living room filled with musical instruments and band posters on the walls. KENJI (the second guitarist), a perpetually mischievous young man with a mop of unruly hair, holds a book aloft with a devilish grin. KENJI (booming) Behold! A gift from the high courts of fan adoration! His bandmates, HARUKA (the disciplined drummer), SORA (the indifferent bassist), and YUMA (the charismatic lead vocalist), look up from their respective activities. Haruka is practicing drum rolls, Sora is lazily strumming his bass, and Yuma is scribbling lyrics. HARUKA (curious) What’s that? New songbook? KENJI (chuckling) Even better, my curious compatriot! Behold, the spine-tingling, the heart-racing, the cheek-blushing— \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\"! YUMA (raising an eyebrow) Why on earth do you have THAT? KENJI (slyly) A gift from an ardent admirer. They must think my guitar solos need more... passion. The room erupts in laughter as the bandmates share amused looks. HARUKA (sardonically) Well, do enlighten us, oh passionate one. What wisdom does this \\"tome\\" contain? KENJI (with mock solemnity) Gather 'round, my musical brethren! Let me serenade you with the sweet sounds of... literature. The band members roll their eyes but huddle closer, smirking and snickering. Kenji clears his throat exaggeratedly, opens the book, and flips through the pages. He puts on a ridiculous, sultry voice while dramatically gesturing with his nondominant hand.

KENJI (continuing) \\"...and his breath, hot against my neck, whispered the fateful words, 'You have bewitched me, body and soul.'\\" At this point, Kenji peers over the top of the book to see if his friends are as entertained by his performance as he is. Everyone is holding back their laughter except for SORA, who appears utterly unfazed as he plucks a bass string. YUMA (cackling) Kenji! For the love of music, never take up audiobook narrating! HARUKA (teasing) Why not? He's just unveiled his secret talent; maybe he'll get scouted by romance novel enthusiasts! KENJI (laughing) Ah, imagine the headlines: 'Guitar God Kenji—Romance Reader Extraordinaire!' The laughter reaches a crescendo, each band member throwing playful jibes and theatrical gasps at each other’s teasing remarks. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS, and YUMA gets up to answer it. Standing at the door is an IMPRESSED FAN, a young woman with starry-eyed admiration. IMPRESSED FAN (excitedly) Hi! I'm here for the private music session I won. Am I interrupting? The band immediately straightens up. Kenji hides the book behind his back with a sheepish grin. Yuma smoothly transitions into his charming frontman persona. YUMA (smoothly) Not at all! We were just... uh, discussing some... classic literature. Kenji here is quite the bookworm! IMPRESSED FAN (intensely interested) Oh wow, I love books! What were you reading? A collective nervous glance is exchanged among the band. Kenji, with the quick wit of a cornered weasel, brings the book forward. KENJI (overly enthusiastic) The dictionary! Yeah, just brushing up on esoteric word solos. Got to keep our lyrics sharp! IMPRESSED FAN (impressed) So intellectual! I can't wait to hear what you come up with!

[탐하고 싶은 재능을 선택하세요.] -경이로운 드리블(SS+3) -예술적인 볼 컨트롤(SS+2) -지지 않는 승부욕(SS) -독보적인 개인기(SS-) -경이로운 골 결정력(S+3) -경악스러운 주력(S+2) 여기서 살짝 고민이 되었다. 가장 등급이 높은 경이로운 드리블을 선택하느냐. 혹은 예술적인 볼 컨트롤을 선택해서 볼 감각의 수준을 더욱 끌어올리느냐. 고민의 시간은 그리 길지 않았다. 앞으로 호날두와 함께할 세월이 얼마인데, 어차피 모두 얻어올 재능이 아닌가. 호영은 가장 궁금한 것부터 해소하기로 결정했다. 예술적인 볼 컨트롤(SS+2) [‘경지에 이른 볼 감각’의 절대치 18.42)] [절대치에 따라 ‘경지에 이른 볼 감각(SSS+2)’으로 성장합니다.] SSS-에서 무려 세 단계의 상승. 예상보다 훨씬 높은 증가폭에 호영은 저도 모르게 어깨를 들썩였다. 아닌 게 아니라, 한계에 가까워지는 느낌이 더욱 실감나기 시작했다. ‘이런 식이면 금방이겠는데.’ 그렇게, 호영의 성장은 궤도에 오르고 있었다. 그러는 사이 올 시즌 레알 마드리드의 첫 무대 ‘피스컵’이 한 발자국 앞으로 다가왔다. 올 시즌 성패의 여부가 그곳에서 얼추 드러날 전망이었다.","output":"Both were capable of playing in various positions, so there were no issues with the formation. However, both individuals had such a strong presence that they often unconsciously interfered with each other's roles. \\"It would be ideal for Woo Ho-young to receive Alonso's build-up and unfold the playmaking in the front...\\" But the problem was that the spaces occupied by Ronaldo and Woo Ho-young intermittently overlapped. On the other hand, giving Ronaldo a free role and assigning Woo Ho-young the finisher's role would result in significant losses for the team during defensive transitions. This was due to the significant difference in their defensive abilities. \\"It's too much of a waste to simply send Woo Ho-young to the front. He's a great help even in defensive participation.\\" The attacking midfielder, capable of taking on as many roles as possible, was considered the best position for Woo Ho-young. Moreover, his stamina had improved significantly this season, allowing him to exert even greater synergy. \\"His ball-handling skills have also improved beyond imagination.\\" Woo Ho-young's ball sense had grown remarkably. Coach Scolari, with 28 years of experience, had a keen enough eye to recognize that. Currently, Woo Ho-young was the world's best ball controller. In terms of ball-handling skills, he was second to none. At least, that's how Scolari saw it. But how could such a Woo Ho-young be simply used as a mere striker? For the team to gain the maximum benefit, he had to be entrusted with a more significant and important mission. That would naturally lead Woo Ho-young to take the initiative. That was precisely where the trouble with Ronaldo began. And that was why Ronaldo had been called in today. \\"Think about it, Chris. We just need to make some concessions and play a good game. But if you maintain the same attitude, I'll have to make a decision according to my own thoughts.\\" Scolari was the man who boldly excluded Romario, the star of the century, from the roster when he was the coach of Brazil in 2002. Given that he had said this, Ronaldo had no choice but to suppress his complaints. In fact, he didn't really have any complaints. Whatever position or role he was given, he would become the protagonist in that role. Ronaldo, understanding Scolari's concerns, answered clearly. \\"I understand. I will do my best in the role I am given.\\" He had no intention of causing discord or playing politics to ruin the team. He was purely obsessed with football. His passion had grown even hotter lately. To perform better than now (although he believed he was better than Woo Ho-young), he endured grueling training every day. \\"Good, I'll look forward to it.\\" \\"I understand.\\" Although he responded that way, the competition with Woo Ho-young was not over. Competitiveness and the will to win. That was the most outstanding part of Ronaldo's life and the driving force that allowed him to develop infinitely as a football player. And as the training was coming to an end. As soon as Woo Ho-young met the condition of 'training with Ronaldo for 2400 minutes,' he could covet one of his talents. [Please select the talent you wish to covet.] - Astonishing Dribbling (SS+3) - Artistic Ball Control (SS+2) - Unyielding Will to Win (SS) - Unrivaled Individual Skill (SS-) - Astonishing Goal Scoring Ability (S+3) - Astounding Sprint Speed (S+2) He was slightly conflicted here. Whether to choose the highest-rated Astonishing Dribbling. Or to select Artistic Ball Control to further elevate the level of his ball sense. The time for deliberation was not long. Considering the time he would spend with Ronaldo in the future, weren't all the talents eventually to be acquired? Woo Ho-young decided to satisfy his curiosity first. Artistic Ball Control (SS+2) ['Masterful Ball Sense' absolute value 18.42)] [According to the absolute value, it grows into 'Masterful Ball Sense (SSS+2)'.] A three-tier jump from SSS-. The increase was much higher than expected, and Woo Ho-young couldn't help but shrug his shoulders. It wasn't for nothing; the feeling of approaching the limit became more tangible. 'It won't take long at this rate.' Thus, Woo Ho-young's growth was on track. Meanwhile, Real Madrid's first stage of the season, the 'Peace Cup,' was just a step away. The prospects for the season's success or failure were expected to be somewhat revealed there."},{"instruction":"” 그 말은 호영에게 엄청난 감동으로 다가왔다. 하도 감격스러운 나머지 눈꺼풀이 파르르 떨릴 정도. 레알 마드리드의 전설에게서 그런 말을 면전에서 듣는다는 건 상상도 못해본 일이었기 때문이다. 그런데. 거기서 이어진 말이 더욱 가관이었다. “자네는 호날두와 경쟁하지 말고 나를 경쟁상대로 잡았어야 맞아.” “···!” 알프레도 디 스테파노. 월드컵 경력이 아예 없음에도 불구하고 펠레와 마라도나의 뒤를 잇는 것은, 그만큼 실력이 뛰어나다는 것을 의미한다. 월드컵 때문에 평가가 절하된 것이 이 정도라는 얘기. 축구 역사상 최고의 선수는 펠레이고, 최강의 선수가 디에고 마라도나라면, 완전한 선수는 ‘알프레도 디 스테파노’라는 말이 있을 정도였다. ‘사상 최고의 올라운드 플레이어’라는 말이 그야말로 적격이었다. 그것은 결코 과장된 이야기가 아니었다. 그는 공을 잡으면 공격형 미드필더로서 빌드업과 플레이메이킹을 주도했고, 적이 공을 잡으면 수비 진영으로 내려가 모든 수비수들의 위치를 정해주고, 필요할 때는 골키퍼로 들어가기도 하였다. 즉, 다재다능함에 있어서 그를 따라잡을 수 있는 선수는 역사상 존재하지 않았다. 지금까지는 말이다. 하지만. “자네에게서 나의 모습이 보여. 할 수 있을 거야. 어느 위치에서든, 무슨 역할을 맡든 간에 경기장을 뒤집어엎어. 그게 바로 자네가 좇아야할 청사진이네.” 호영은 고개를 천천히 끄덕이며 대답했다. ‘경쟁은 더 높은 위치에 있는 사람과 하는 거라···.’ 따끔한 충고를 들은 기분. 비록 짧았지만 뼈와 살이 되는 이야기를 귀담을 수 있는 좋은 시간이었다. “고민이 좀 해결이 되었나?” “예. 제가 앞으로 나아갈 길이 더 확고해졌습니다.” 스콜라리가 지시한 역할에 충실하되, 본인만의 재능을 발휘해 경기를 끌고 나가면 되는 것이었다. “그럼 부탁 하나만 드려도 되겠습니까?” “도울 수 있는 게 있으면 얼마든지 돕지.” “조언을 구할 게 있다면 언제든 찾아뵙고 싶습니다.” “매일 흔들의자에 걸터앉아 신문이나 보고 있는 노인에게는 반가운 소식이구먼. 선수들은 나를 어려워해서 못 찾아오는 것이지, 내가 바빠서 못 찾아오는 것이 아닐세. 다음엔 자네 할아버지와 함께 보는 것도 괜찮겠구만.” “할아버지에게 효도 한 번 제대로 할 수 있겠네요.” 호영이 그런 부탁을 한 이유는 자명했다. 스테파노는 멘토로서 더없이 좋은 사람이었기 때문이다. 그리고 하나 더. [알프레도 디 스테파노] 보유재능 -올라운더의 다재다능함(L) -지지 않는 승부욕(SS-) -천재적인 전술 이해도(S-) -선수를 바라보는 탁월한 안목(A+) (현재 퇴화된 재능은 볼 수 없습니다.) (조건을 만족할 시 한 가지 재능을 탐할 수 있습니다.) (S등급 이상은 히든조건을 달성해야 탐할 수 있습니다.)

[알프레도 디 스테파노가 우호영을 먼저 만나자, 호날두는 심기가 매우 불편하다며 불만을 표출하였다.] 이런 추측성 기사가 난무하였지만 사실은 그렇지 않았다. 호날두는 그런 것으로 삐지거나 불만을 가질 정도로 졸렬한 선수가 아니었다. 물론 아쉬운 마음이 드는 것은 사실이었다. 하지만 우호영은 레알 마드리드에 4년씩이나 몸담아온 선수가 아니던가? 호날두로서는 충분히 이해할 수 있었다. 그러면서 둘은 많은 시간을 함께 보내며 사이를 발전시켜갔다. 미국의 밤은 친해지기에 딱 좋았다. 그리고 그 시각 마드리드. 칼데론 회장은 본격적인 리빌딩에 착수하였다. 그것은 시즌이 시작되는 8월 말까지 이어졌고, 그 결과 레알 마드리드는 거의 새로운 팀으로 탈바꿈하게 되었다.","output":"That statement deeply moved Woo Ho-young. So much so that his eyelids trembled with emotion. It was unimaginable for him to hear such words directly from a legend of Real Madrid. But then. The words that followed were even more remarkable. \\"You shouldn't compete with Ronaldo; you should have chosen me as your competitor.\\" \\"···!\\" Alfredo Di Stefano. Despite having no World Cup experience, being considered next in line after Pelé and Maradona meant that his skills were exceptional. It was said that the World Cup undervalued him to this extent. There was a saying that if Pelé was the greatest player in football history and Diego Maradona was the strongest, then the most complete player was 'Alfredo Di Stefano.' The phrase 'the greatest all-around player in history' was truly fitting for him. It was by no means an exaggeration. When he had the ball, he led the build-up and playmaking as an attacking midfielder, and when the enemy had the ball, he would go down to the defensive field to set the positions for all defenders, and sometimes he would even step in as a goalkeeper. In other words, there had been no player in history who could match his versatility. Until now, that is. But. \\"I see myself in you. You can do it. No matter the position or role, turn the game upside down. That's the blueprint you should follow.\\" Woo Ho-young nodded slowly and replied. 'Competition is with someone in a higher position...' It felt like a sharp piece of advice. Although brief, it was a good time to heed a story that would become flesh and bone. \\"Has your concern been somewhat resolved?\\" \\"Yes. I have a clearer path to move forward.\\" He had to be faithful to the role assigned by Scolari, but also lead the game with his own talent. \\"May I ask you one favor?\\" \\"If there's anything I can help with, I'll do it.\\" \\"I would like to seek your advice whenever possible.\\" \\"It's welcome news for an old man who just sits in a rocking chair reading the newspaper. The players are too intimidated to come to me, not because I'm too busy to see them. Next time, it would be nice to have your grandfather with you.\\" \\"I'll be able to properly honor my grandfather.\\" The reason Woo Ho-young made such a request was clear. Di Stefano was an excellent person to have as a mentor. And one more thing. [Alfredo Di Stefano] Talents Owned - Versatility of an All-Rounder (L) - Unyielding Will to Win (SS-) - Genius Tactical Understanding (S-) - Exceptional Eye for Talent (A+) (Currently, degenerated talents cannot be seen.) (You can covet one talent if you meet the conditions.) (S grade and above require hidden conditions to be met.) (Condition 1: Win the Champions League with Real Madrid) (Condition 2: Win the Champions League top scorer award with Real Madrid) (Condition 3: Win La Liga with Real Madrid) (Condition 4: Make 100 official appearances with Real Madrid) (Condition 5: Have a 1200-minute conversation with Alfredo Di Stefano) (Condition 6: Receive know-how from Alfredo Di Stefano) (Hidden condition: Unlocked when coveting at least one talent) 'With that, I can end my worries about limitations.' Champions League victory. 100 official appearances. They won't be easy, but aren't they things that need to be achieved anyway? For Woo Ho-young, it was a good opportunity to reaffirm his goals. August in Madrid was quiet. The reason was that Real Madrid had gone on a world tour. Madrid's private jet, carrying a squad of 25 players, embarked on an American tour starting in Toronto, Canada. Since there were no limits on substitutions, Scolari could use various combinations and conduct several experiments. In the first match against Toronto FC, Woo Ho-young and Raúl played brilliantly, leading to a 4-1 victory. In the subsequent match against DC United of the United States, Ronaldo achieved a hat-trick, continuing the winning streak. The weaknesses pointed out during the Peace Cup were gradually being addressed. Praise from football experts followed suit. In particular, the experts agreed that the chemistry between Woo Ho-young and Ronaldo was improving day by day. However, there were media outlets trying to sow discord between the two. [After Alfredo Di Stefano met with Woo Ho-young first, Ronaldo expressed his discomfort and dissatisfaction.] Such speculative articles were rampant, but the truth was not so. Ronaldo was not a petty player who would sulk or harbor dissatisfaction over such matters. Of course, he did feel a bit disappointed. But wasn't Woo Ho-young a player who had been with Real Madrid for four whole years? Ronaldo could fully understand that. Meanwhile, the two spent a lot of time together, developing their relationship. The nights in America were perfect for getting closer. And at that time in Madrid. President Calderón had embarked on a full-scale rebuilding. This continued until the end of August when the season started, and as a result, Real Madrid was almost completely transformed into a new team."},{"instruction":"그래서 내린 선택은 다이렉트 패스였다. 뻐엉! [페어 메르테사커의 롱 패스가 2선으로 떨어집니다. 우호영이 그쪽을 향해 뛰어가는군요.] [후안 로드리게스(Juan Rodriguez)가 동시에 달려듭니다.] 미리 자리를 잡고 있었던 후안 로드리게스는 호영보다 한 타이밍 더 빠르게 뛰어오를 수 있었다. 하지만 그 외의 이점은 없었다. 오히려 체격이 호영보다 더 작았기에, 매우 큰 결점이 있었다. 퍼억! “··· 무슨!” 공중으로 뛰어오른 로드리게스는 머리도 채 꺾어보지 못하고 몸싸움에서 밀려났다. [우호영이 로드리게스를 짓눌러버립니다!] [무시무시한 피지컬입니다. 27세의 성인선수를 저렇게 무참히 눌러버리다니요. 로드리게스로서는 차라리 공중 볼을 내어주고 패스를 차단하는 편이 나았을지도 모르겠습니다.] 그 시각 좌측에는 호날두가, 우측에는 로벤이 측면으로 파고들면서 존재감을 과시하고 있었다. 호영은 천군만마를 얻은 듯한 느낌이었다. 이전에 타고 있던 배가 1등급 구축함이었다면, 이제는 항공모함에 타있는 것 같았다. 그리고 호영은 조타실의 항해사였다. ‘집중하자.’ 순간 호영의 두뇌가 빠르게 돌아갔다. 찰나만에 최상의 공격루트가 머릿속에 번뜩 떠올랐다. ‘전방.’ 머리대신 공을 가슴으로 받아낸 호영은, 앞으로 짧게 공을 내어주었다. 벤제마가 서있는 곳이었다. 타악! [벤제마가 수비를 등진 채 패스를 받습니다!] [동시에 우호영이 전방으로 침투를 시도하는데요!] 모든 것은 우호영의 계획대로 이뤄졌다. 우측의 로벤이 측면에서 활발히 움직이며 수비수들을 박스 밖으로 유인해내고, 좌측의 호날두가 박스 안쪽으로 황급히 쇄도하면서 향후에 벌어질 공격전개에 완벽하게 대비하고 있었다. 역시 월드클래스다운 움직임. 여기서 벤제마가 호영에게 전진 패스를 내어주기만 하면 완벽한 상황이었다. 하지만. 투욱. 벤제마는 모두의 기대를 뒤엎고 뒤를 돌았다. [벤제마가 공을 뒤로 빼냅니다!] [돌면서 터닝슈우우우웃!] 기습적인 슈팅시도에 데포르티보의 수비진이 살짝 흔들렸지만, 슈팅각도가 좁은 탓에 슈팅이 막혀버렸다. [알베르토 로호(Alberto Lopo)가 다리로 슈팅을 막아냅니다!] 슈팅실패. 거기서 끝났으면 다행이겠지만 무리한 욕심 뒤에는 항상 위기가 찾아오는 법. 로호의 허벅지에 맞고 튀어오른 공이, 우측 풀백 필리페 루이스(Filipe Luis)의 발밑으로 떨어진 것이었다. 역습은 지체하지 않고 시작되었다. [필리페 루이스가 빠른 스피드를 앞세워 오버래핑을 시도합니다! 데포르티보의 선수들이 일제히 올라가고 있어요!] 데포르티보는 역습에 매우 강한 팀이다. 먼저 견고한 수비를 구축한 뒤, 중앙 공격수 아드리안 로페스(Adrian Lopez)의 자유분방한 활동을 활용해 날카로운 역습을 추구한다. 그리고 그 과정에서 필리페 루이스(Filipe Luis)의 오버래핑이 빛을 발한다. 지금이 바로 그 타이밍이었다. [아르헨 로벤이 막아서지만 무용지물입니다! 그대로 뚫고 나가는데요!] [레알 마드리드, 집중해야합니다. 전반전 막바지에 동점골을 내어줄 수도 있어요!] 필리페 루이스는 이미 하프라인을 넘어선 상태였다. 그 광경에 벤제마의 얼굴이 시퍼렇게 질려갔다. ‘망했다.’ 여기서 실점이라도 한다면 그땐 지옥행 열차를 타는 것이나 다름없었다. 문자 그대로 ‘최악의 데뷔전’. 무리하지 않고 호영에게 공을 찔러줬더라면 이런 불상사는 일어나지 않았을 터였다. 하지만 후회하기에는 이미 늦었다. 벤제마의 얼굴이 경악으로 뒤덮인 찰나였다. “···!!” [우호영! 우호영이 달려갑니다!] [엄청난 질주본능을 보여주고 있습니다!] 최전방으로 나가있었던 호영이, 어느새 50미터를 달려 하프라인까지 돌아간 것이 아닌가. 보고도 믿기 힘든 일이었다. “루이스! 조심해!” “뒤에 온다!” 공을 치고 달리던 필리페 루이스가 슬쩍 시선을 돌려 상황을 파악했다. ‘어림없지.’ 여기서 아드리안 로페스에게 공만 전달하기만 하면 끝이었다. 그리고 전방의 아드리안 로페스에게 패스를 건넨 순간이었다. 타악! “···!!” [우호영의 슬라이딩 태클!] [필리페 루이스의 패스를 잘라냅니다! 우호영이 엄청난 투지를 발휘하는군요!] 믿기지 않는 상황. 뒤쪽에서 미친 듯이 달려온 우호영이 패스를 차단한 것이 아닌가. 필리페 루이스는 경악을 금치 못했다. ‘이걸 예상하고 잘라냈다고?’ 아니, 그것보다 더 믿기지 않는 것이 있었다. ‘방금 저 뒤에 있지 않았었나······?’ 그랬다. 우호영은 분명 저 뒤에 있었다. 루이스로서는 틀림없이 여유로운 상황이었다. 다만 호영의 속도가 예상보다 너무 빨랐을 뿐이었다. 더해, 예측력을 앞세운 수비위치 선정 능력도 한몫하였다. 공격형 미드필더에게서는 결코 찾아볼 수 없는 플레이였다. 경기장은 어느새 호영의 이름으로 가득 차있었다. 벤제마를 응원하던 관중들도 호영의 이름을 외치고 있었다. 이제는 벤제마가 누군지 관심도 없는 듯 보였다. 모두가 호영에게 열광했다. 더욱이 거기서 끝이 아니었다. 호영이 잘라낸 공은 근처에 있던 사비 알론소에게 굴러가 착지했고, 호영은 오뚝이처럼 벌떡 일어나 지면을 박찼다. 동시에 외쳤다. “달려!” 기회에서 위기로. 위기에서 다시 기회로 전환된 순간이었다.","output":"So the choice made was a direct pass. Whizz! [Per Mertesacker's long pass falls to the second line. Woo Ho-young is running towards it.] [Juan Rodriguez is also sprinting at the same time.] Juan Rodriguez, who had positioned himself in advance, was able to jump a beat faster than Ho-young. However, that was the only advantage he had. In fact, since his physique was smaller than Ho-young's, it was a significant flaw. Thump! \\"...What!\\" Rodriguez, who had leaped into the air, was pushed out of the contest before he could even angle his head to the ball. [Woo Ho-young overpowers Rodriguez!] [Such an intimidating physical presence. To push down a 27-year-old professional player so ruthlessly. Perhaps Rodriguez would have been better off giving up the aerial ball and trying to intercept the pass instead.] At that moment, Ronaldo was making his presence felt on the left side, and Robben was penetrating the right flank. Ho-young felt as if he had gained an army. If the ship he was previously on was a first-class destroyer, now it felt like he was on an aircraft carrier. And Ho-young was the navigator in the wheelhouse. 'Focus.' In an instant, Ho-young's brain whirred into action. The optimal route for attack flashed through his mind in a split second. 'Forward.' Instead of using his head, Ho-young chested the ball down and nudged it forward. It was where Benzema was standing. Tap! [Benzema receives the pass with his back to the defense!] [At the same time, Woo Ho-young is making a forward run!] Everything was going according to Ho-young's plan. Robben on the right was actively moving along the flank, drawing defenders out of the box, while Ronaldo on the left was rushing inside the box, perfectly prepared for the upcoming attack. Truly world-class movement. If Benzema just gave a forward pass to Ho-young, it would have been a perfect situation. But. Twist. Benzema, against everyone's expectations, turned around. [Benzema pulls the ball back!] [Turning and shooting!] The surprise shot attempt slightly shook Deportivo's defense, but the narrow angle meant the shot was blocked. [Alberto Lopo blocks the shot with his leg!] Shot failed. It would have been fortunate if it had ended there, but after undue greed, there's always a crisis looming. The ball, deflected off Lopo's thigh, fell right to the feet of right-back Filipe Luis. The counterattack began without delay. [Filipe Luis is attempting an overlapping run with his fast speed! Deportivo's players are all moving up!] Deportivo is a team very strong on the counter. They first establish a solid defense, then use the free-spirited movement of their central forward, Adrian Lopez, to pursue sharp counterattacks. And in that process, Filipe Luis's overlapping runs shine. This was exactly the right timing. [Arjen Robben tries to block him, but it's futile! He breaks through just like that!] [Real Madrid needs to concentrate. They could concede an equalizer at the end of the first half!] Filipe Luis had already crossed the halfway line. Benzema's face turned pale at the sight. 'It's over.' If they conceded a goal now, it would be like boarding a train to hell. Literally 'the worst debut.' If he hadn't been greedy and had simply passed the ball to Ho-young, this mishap wouldn't have happened. But it was too late for regrets. Benzema's face was covered in horror. \\"...!!\\" [Woo Ho-young! Woo Ho-young is running!] [He's showing an incredible instinct to sprint!] Ho-young, who had been at the forefront, had somehow run back 50 meters to the halfway line. It was hard to believe even when seen. \\"Luís! Be careful!\\" \\"He's coming from behind!\\" Filipe Luis, who was running with the ball, glanced back to assess the situation. 'No chance.' All he had to do was pass the ball to Adrian Lopez, and it would be over. And the moment he passed the ball to Adrian Lopez in front... Tap! \\"...!!\\" [Woo Ho-young's sliding tackle!] [He cuts off Filipe Luis's pass! Woo Ho-young is showing tremendous fighting spirit!] An unbelievable situation. Woo Ho-young, who had run like mad from behind, intercepted the pass. Filipe Luis was in shock. 'He anticipated and cut it off?' No, there was something even more unbelievable. 'Wasn't he just behind me...?' Yes. Woo Ho-young was definitely behind him. For Luis, it was undoubtedly a comfortable situation. It was just that Ho-young's speed was much faster than expected. Additionally, his ability to choose defensive positions based on prediction played a part. It was a play that could never be expected from an attacking midfielder. The stadium was now filled with Ho-young's name. Even the spectators who were cheering for Benzema were now shouting Ho-young's name. It seemed they no longer cared who Benzema was. Everyone was ecstatic about Ho-young. And it didn't end there. The ball that Ho-young intercepted rolled towards Xabi Alonso nearby, and Ho-young, like a jack-in-the-box, sprang up and stamped the ground. At the same time, he shouted. \\"Run!\\" From opportunity to crisis. From crisis back to opportunity, it was a moment of transition."},{"instruction":"” 호영의 또래나 될까 싶을 그는 어디론가 쏜살같이 달려가 펜을 하나 구하고 왔다. 직후 와이셔츠를 등 뒤로 반쯤 올리면서 말했다. “거기에 사인 좀 해주세요!” “이거 유성펜이잖아요.” “네, 맞아요. 그걸로 해주시면 돼요!” “아, 예.” 맞다. 잠깐 그것을 망각했다. 스페인 사람들에게 있어서 축구란 인생 그 자체라는 사실을 말이다. “다 됐습니다.” “와, 감사합니다. 정말 감사합니다. 정말 팬이거든요.” “하하. 고맙습니다. 악수나 한 번 해요.” “감사합니다!” 다른 사람이 자신을 이렇게나 좋아해주는데, 이 얼마나 고마운 일인가. 호영은 성심성의껏 팬서비스를 해주며 다시 발걸음을 옮겼다. 하지만 그땐 이미 늦었다. 수많은 사람들이 호영을 주시하고 있는 것이었다. 축구장에서나 흐름을 읽을 줄 알지, 여기에서는 제대로 쓰지도 못하는 재능이었다. “헉. 저기 봐.” “우호영 아니야?” “우호영이 여길 왜 와.” “아는 사람 있나보지!” “설마 여자친구?” “말도 안 돼.” “안 돼.” “반대야.” “그럼 한 번 가보자.” 남녀노소 불문하고 수많은 사람들이 가운데로 몰려들고 있었다. 호영은 이미 반쯤 체념한 상태였다. 한두 번 있는 일이 아니었기 때문이다. ‘오늘은 머리가 너무 튀었나? 아니면 선글라스?’ 특히나 난리법석인 여성들의 반응을 보자면 그것 때문만은 아닌 것도 같았다. 솔직히 오늘은 평소보다 외모와 의상에 신경을 쓰긴 했다. 그래서인지 사람들의 반응이 더욱 폭발적이었다. ‘엄청나구만.’ 금세 인파에 둘러싸이고만 호영은 모든 것을 내려놓고 선글라스를 시원하게 벗었다. 어차피 오늘은 푹 쉬기로 작정했으니, 이왕 이렇게 된 거 돌발 팬 사인회나 연다고 생각하면 될 것이었다. 그 시각 학교 안에서 졸업식을 준비 중이던 학생들은 난리도 아니었다. “야, 그거 들었어?” “뭐?” “밖에 우호영 왔대.” “뭐? 어디!” “학교 안으로 들어오고 있다는데?” “헉.” “야, 어디가! 졸업식 준비해야지 이 미친년아!” 호영의 주된 팬층이 ‘10대 소녀’와 ‘5~100세 남성’이다보니 자연스럽게 생기는 현상이었다. 올해 초부터는 호영을 캐릭터로 만들어 학용품 같은 것을 판매하기도 했는데, 주 고객 역시 10대 소녀들이나 자식을 둔 남성들이었다. 구단과 호영에게 들어오는 초상권수입도 짭짤했다. 그만큼 현재 전 세계적으로 우호영 열풍이 불고 있었다. 하지만 이를 이해하지 못하는 한 소녀가 있었다. “어유. 다들 난리도 아니네. 세상에 딱 한 번 있는 졸업식인데 말이야. 뭐, 축구선수 처음 봐?” 마리아 사르다. 돈 많고 잘 생긴 남자친구가 있는 그녀로서는 우호영에게 남자로서의 매력을 느껴본 적이 없었다. 그리고 무엇보다, 동양인은 그녀의 취향이 아니었다. 우호영을 실제로 본 적은 없었지만, 본다고 하더라도 딱히 감흥은 없을 것 같았다. 그래서 다른 친구들의 행동이 이해가 되질 않았다. 도대체 그가 뭐가 좋다고 그렇게들 난리인지 말이다. “얘. 너도 우호영 팬이니?” 사르다는 옆에서 화장을 하고 있던 한 소녀에게 물었다. 그러자 모니카가 말했다. “응. 엄청 좋아해.” 둘은 룸메이트였다. 하지만 사이가 마냥 좋은 것은 아니었다. 언제나 그렇듯 사르다는 예쁘게 몸매 좋은 모니카를 질투했고, 항상 트집을 잡길 원했다. 오늘도 다를 건 없었다. “너 남자친구도 있잖아? 밤마다 몰래 나가서 통화하는. 그러다 네 남자친구가 알면 속상하겠다.” “이제 안 해. 그 애가 핸드폰 사줬거든.” “어머, 지금 남자친구 돈 많다고 자랑하는 거야? 얘도 참. 우리 나이 대에 많으면 얼마나 많다고~.” 그 말에 모니카는 그저 웃었다. 마음 같아서는 “응. 우호영이 내 남자친구야~.”라고 말하고 싶었지만, 진짜 남자친구는 아니었기 때문이다. 적어도 모니카는 그렇게 생각하고 있었지만······. ‘나만 그렇게 생각하는 걸 수도 있으니까.’ 가끔씩은 말하고 싶어도 섣불리 말할 수 없는 이유가 바로 그것이었다. 이윽고 사르다가 말했다. “빨리 나와~ 곧 시작하겠다.” “그래.” 잠시 후 진행된 졸업식은 과연 예술학교답게 후배들의 화려한 축하무대로 시작되었다. 이번에 졸업하는 학생들은 학교에서 연계된 전문체육원에 들어가거나 따로 코치진을 두고, 본격적으로 올림픽을 향한 꿈을 키우게 된다. 올해 모니카는 비교적 돈이 덜 드는 전문체육원에 들어갈 예정이었다. 물론 그마저도 유학비가 어마어마하게 드는 수준이라 집안의 도움을 받아야하는 입장이었지만, 스페인에 올 수 있다는 것만으로도 다행이었다. 이윽고 졸업식이 성황리에 끝나자 모니카는 주변을 두리번거렸다. 다른 친구들은 이미 대부분 부모님과 함께 사진을 찍고 있었다. ‘호영이는 아직 안 왔나?’그 생각을 할 무렵이었다. “모니카!” 모니카를 다급히 부르는 목소리. “사진 좀 찍어줘!” 마리아 사르다였다. 그리고 그 옆에는, 돈 많고 잘 생겼다며 사르다가 입이 닳도록 자랑하던 남자친구가 같이 서있었다. 거절할 이유는 없었기에 바로 부탁을 들어주었다. “찍는다?” 찰칵. 그렇게, 사진을 한 방 찍어준 직후였다. “모니카.” “어, 호영아! 와있었구나.” “그럼. 막바지에 잠깐 화장실 갔다 오느라.” 뒤에서 불쑥 튀어나온 호영이었다. 그러자 순간 모니카는 숨이 멎은 듯했다. 멋진 옷차림으로 대면하는 만큼 느낌은 더욱 특별했으니까. 누가 보나 선남선녀였다. 제대로 스타일링한 호영의 모습은 생각했던 것 이상으로 멋있었고, 화장에다가 드레스까지 갖춰 입은 모니카 역시 마찬가지였다. 그리고 참으로 재미있는 상황이 벌어졌다. “저기!” 황급히 달려온 사르다의 남자친구. 놀랍게도 그는 오늘 아침에 사인을 받은 소년 중 하나였다. “사, 사진 같이 찍어요!” 그는 사르다를 버리고 호영에게 냉큼 달려와 셀카를 찍었다. 사르다는 이게 무슨 일인가 싶어 모니카에게 물었다. “둘이··· 아는 사이?” 이에 대답한 이는 모니카가 아닌 호영이었다. “남자친구에요.” 그 말에 쿵쾅대는 소리가 새어나갈 것처럼 크게 울렸다. 모니카의 심장소리였다.","output":"The man, who seemed to be about the same age as Ho-young, dashed off somewhere and came back with a pen. Then, while lifting the back of his dress shirt halfway up, he said, \\"Could you please sign here?\\" \\"This is a permanent marker.\\" \\"Yes, that's right. You can use that!\\" \\"Ah, okay.\\" Right. He had momentarily forgotten. That for the Spanish, football is life itself. \\"All done.\\" \\"Wow, thank you so much. I'm really a fan.\\" \\"Ha ha. Thank you. Let's shake hands.\\" \\"Thank you!\\" How grateful it was for someone to like him so much. Ho-young sincerely provided fan service and then moved on. But by then, it was already too late. Numerous people were watching Ho-young. He knew how to read the flow on the football field, but here, his talent was of no use. \\"Look over there.\\" \\"Isn't that Woo Ho-young?\\" \\"Why would Woo Ho-young come here?\\" \\"He must know someone!\\" \\"Maybe his girlfriend?\\" \\"No way.\\" \\"Impossible.\\" \\"I object.\\" \\"Let's go check it out.\\" People of all ages were flocking towards the center. Ho-young had already half-resigned himself to the situation. It wasn't the first time this had happened. \\"Is my hair too noticeable today? Or is it the sunglasses?\\" Especially considering the frenzied reaction of the women, it seemed it wasn't just because of that. To be honest, he had paid more attention to his appearance and outfit than usual today. Perhaps that's why people's reactions were even more explosive. 'Incredible.' Surrounded by a crowd in no time, Ho-young coolly took off his sunglasses, having decided to take it easy today. Since he had planned to relax, he thought he might as well hold an impromptu fan signing event. At that moment, inside the school, students preparing for the graduation ceremony were in a frenzy. \\"Hey, did you hear?\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Woo Ho-young is outside.\\" \\"What? Where!\\" \\"He's coming into the school?\\" \\"Wow.\\" \\"Hey, where are you going! We need to prepare for the graduation, you crazy girl!\\" Ho-young's main fan base being 'teenage girls' and 'men aged 5 to 100' naturally caused such a phenomenon. Since the beginning of the year, they had even started selling stationery featuring Ho-young as a character, and the main customers were teenage girls and men with children. The image rights revenue coming into the club and Ho-young was substantial. Such was the global Woo Ho-young craze. However, there was one girl who didn't understand all this. \\"Ugh. Everyone's making such a fuss. It's a once-in-a-lifetime graduation ceremony. What, is it your first time seeing a football player?\\" Maria Sarda. For her, who had a rich and handsome boyfriend, she had never felt any attraction to Woo Ho-young as a man. And above all, Asians were not her type. She had never seen Woo Ho-young in person, but even if she did, she didn't think she would feel anything special. So she couldn't understand the behavior of her friends. What was so great about him that everyone was making such a fuss? \\"Hey. Are you a fan of Woo Ho-young too?\\" Sarda asked a girl who was doing her makeup next to her. Then Monica replied, \\"Yeah. I really like him.\\" They were roommates. But their relationship wasn't always good. As always, Sarda was jealous of the pretty and well-shaped Monica and always wanted to find fault with her. Today was no different. \\"You have a boyfriend, right? The one you sneak out to call at night. He'd be upset if he found out.\\" \\"I don't do that anymore. He bought me a phone.\\" \\"Oh my, are you bragging about your boyfriend being rich now? Look at you. How much could he possibly have at our age?\\" At that, Monica just smiled. She wanted to say, \\"Yeah. Woo Ho-young is my boyfriend~,\\" but he wasn't really her boyfriend. At least that's what Monica thought... 'I might be the only one who thinks that way.' Sometimes she wanted to say it, but that was precisely why she couldn't speak rashly. Then Sarda said, \\"Hurry up~ It's about to start.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Shortly after, the graduation ceremony began with a splendid congratulatory performance by the juniors, befitting an art school. This year's graduates would either enter a professional sports academy affiliated with the school or hire a coaching team to start pursuing their Olympic dreams in earnest. Monica was planning to enter a professional sports academy that was relatively less expensive. Of course, even that required a substantial amount of study abroad fees, so she needed her family's help, but she was grateful just to be able to come to Spain. As the graduation ceremony ended successfully, Monica looked around. Most of her friends were already taking pictures with their parents. 'Hasn't Ho-young arrived yet?' She was thinking that when... \\"Monica!\\" A voice urgently calling Monica. \\"Take a picture for us!\\" It was Maria Sarda. And next to her stood the rich and handsome boyfriend Sarda had always boasted about. There was no reason to refuse, so she immediately obliged. \\"Ready?\\" Click. Right after taking the picture... \\"Monica.\\" \\"Oh, Ho-young! You were here.\\" \\"Of course. I just went to the bathroom for a bit at the end.\\" Ho-young had suddenly appeared from behind. At that moment, Monica felt as if her breath had stopped. The feeling was even more special as they faced each other in stylish outfits. They were a handsome couple to anyone's eyes. Ho-young, who had styled himself properly, looked even better than she had imagined, and Monica, with her makeup and dressed up, was no different. And then an interesting situation unfolded. \\"Over here!\\" Sarda's boyfriend, who had hurriedly run over, was surprisingly one of the boys who had gotten an autograph that morning. \\"Can, can we take a picture together?\\" He left Sarda and quickly ran to Ho-young to take a selfie. Sarda, puzzled by what was happening, asked Monica, \\"Do you two... know each other?\\" The one who answered wasn't Monica, but Ho-young. \\"He's my boyfriend.\\" At that, a thumping sound seemed to echo loudly. It was the sound of Monica's heartbeat."},{"instruction":"팔뚝 위로 오돌토돌한 닭살이 올라오는 것은 민망해서 그런 것이 아니라, 공감을 나누고 있는 것이었다. 보통 축구선수들이 가까워지는 단계는 두 가지로 나뉘는데, 첫 번째는 땀을 흘리며 육체적으로 가까워지는 것이다. 그리고 두 번째는 생각을 교감하며 정신적으로 가까워지는 경우인데, 호영과 호날두는 지금 그 과정에 놓여있었다. 아직은 어색했지만 정신으로는 서로를 이해하며 존중하고 있었다. 그리고 그 둘을 경외심 가득한 눈으로 바라보는 한 사람. 더글라스 코스타는 침을 꼴깍 삼키며 둘을 바라보았다. 마치 다른 세계에 와있는 것 같은 느낌이었다. 11월 21일 산티아고 베르나베우. 관중석이 한 자리도 빠짐없이 가득 찬 가운데, 양 팀 선수들이 입장했다. 리그 9승에 도전하는 레알 마드리드와 2승에 도전하는 라싱 산탄데르의 대결이었다. 올 시즌 라싱 산탄데르는 1승 6무 3패로 그럭저럭 괜찮은 성적을 거두고 있었다. 승리가 1승밖에 없다는 것은 심각한 일이지만, 그나마 무승부라도 많이 챙겨서 중위권을 유지할 수 있었다. [4경기 연속 무승부를 기록하고 있는 라싱 산탄데르가 오늘도 역시 5-4-1을 들고 나왔네요. 다섯 명의 수비수를 최후방에 두고, 그 위에 파페 디우프와 마르크 토레혼이 수비형 미드필더로 나섰습니다. 그 위에 2선에는 라울 가르시아가 보이네요.] 한화 40억에 업어온 파페 디우프(Pape Diop)와 마르크 토레혼(Marc Torrejon). 그리고 AT마드리드에서 공짜로 데려온 라울 가르시아(Luis Garcia)가 현재 라싱을 무승부의 제왕으로 이끌고 있었다. 그들은 경기 초반 체력을 왕창 쏟아 부어 중원에 타이트한 전후방 압박을 가하고, 후반전에 체력이 바닥나면 교체되어 나온다. 그것이 그들의 전략이었다. [그에 반해 레알 마드리드는 아주 도전적이고 실험적인 전술을 준비해왔군요. 호날두와 라울 그리고 우호영을 쓰리톱으로 내세운 4-3-3 대형이에요.] [사실상 일주일 뒤 있을 엘 클라시코에 대비한 연막작전일 수도 있겠지만, 오늘 결과에 따라 실제로 사용될지도 모릅니다. 지금쯤 바르셀로나의 전력분석관이 매우 바빠지겠죠.] 경기는 시작부터 극적으로 흘러갔다. 라싱 산탄데르는 극도로 수비적인 태도를 취했고, 레알 마드리드는 에너지를 쏟아 부으며 공격에 박차를 가했다. 모든 공격은 중원에서부터 시작되었다. 수비형 미드필더 라싸나 디아라가 후방을 책임지고, 그 위의 사비 알론소와 요앙 구르퀴프가 볼 배급을 맡으며 빌드업을 쌓아갔다. [둘의 호흡이 생각보다 괜찮네요. 사비 알론소는 두말할 필요 없고, 요앙 구르퀴프 역시 준수한 활약을 보여주고 있어요. 지난 시즌 AC밀란에서 최악의 시즌을 보냈던 요앙 구르퀴프지만, 그래도 아직 자신이 쓸만하다는 것을 증명해내고 있습니다.] [그렇습니다. 이제 겨우 23살밖에 되지 않았습니다. 충분히 더 성장할 수 있는 가능성이 있어요. 한때 괜히 제2의 지단이라고 불렸던 게 아닙니다.] 요앙 구르퀴프는 넓은 시야를 앞세워 전후방으로 정확한 패스를 배급하였다. 파페 디우프의 압박이 거칠게 들어올 때면, 침착하고 준수한 발재간을 이용해 압박에서 벗어났다. 그러는 사이 사비 알론소가 최전방의 쓰리톱을 봐주었다. [최전방에 위치한 호날두와 라울 그리고 우호영이 끊임없이 스위칭을 하면서 라싱의 수비라인을 교란시킵니다.] [유기적이고 유연한 움직임이에요. 자칫하면 볼 배급이 원활히 이뤄지지 않을 수도 있지만, 후방에 사비 알론소라는 든든한 지원군이 있다 보니 자유분방하게 움직일 수 있는 것이죠.] 첫 번째 득점찬스 역시 사비 알론소의 발끝에서 비롯되었다. [측면으로 흘러가는 공. 크리스티아누 호날두가 달려가 잡습니다. 곧바로 돌파를 시도하는데요.] [호세 크레스포가 달려가 호날두를 마크합니다.] 하지만 상황은 순식간에 전개되었다. 타닥. 뻐엉! 헛다리짚기로 호세 크레스포(Jose Crespo)를 살짝 벗겨내면서 힘껏 슈팅을 때린 것이었다. 가장 자신 있는 각도인 만큼 공이 제대로 들어갔다. 다만 골키퍼의 손 끝에 맞으며 골대 밖으로 굴절되어 나갔다. 그리고 마무리는. 철렁! 그 앞에서 기다리고 있던 호영이었다. [골! 골입니다! 우호영이 리그 9호 골을 달성하는군요! 올해는 정말 득점왕이 가능할 지도 모르겠습니다!] 오오오오오오오오! 등 뒤로 격한 함성이 울려 퍼졌다. 그러나 호영은 세리머니를 간략하게 끝내고 말았다. 그의 얼굴에는 복잡한 감정이 서려있었다. 삐익- 경기는 2대0 레알 마드리드의 승리로 종료되었다. 그리고 호영은 옷을 갈아입기도 전에 감독실을 찾아갔다. 왜 왔냐는 스콜라리의 질문이 이어졌다. 호영은 복잡한 얼굴을 내비치며 말했다. “전술에 관해 드릴 말씀이 있습니다.” 그러자 물통을 들이켜고 있던 스콜라리의 얼굴까지 복잡해져갔다.","output":"The goosebumps rising on his forearm were not due to embarrassment, but rather because he was sharing empathy. The stages at which football players typically become closer can be divided into two types: the first is getting physically closer by sweating it out together, and the second is becoming mentally closer by sharing thoughts and feelings. Ho-young and Ronaldo were in the midst of this process. It was still awkward, but mentally they were beginning to understand and respect each other. And one person was watching the two with eyes full of awe. Douglas Costa swallowed hard as he observed them, feeling as if he were in a different world. November 21st at Santiago Bernabéu. With every seat in the stands filled, the players from both teams made their entrance. It was a match between Real Madrid, aiming for their 9th league win, and Racing Santander, aiming for their 2nd win. This season, Racing Santander had a decent record of 1 win, 6 draws, and 3 losses. Having only one win was a serious matter, but they managed to maintain a mid-table position by securing many draws. [Racing Santander, who have recorded four consecutive draws, have come out with a 5-4-1 formation again today. They have five defenders at the back, with Pape Diop and Marc Torrejon as defensive midfielders. Above them, we see Raúl García in the second line.] Pape Diop and Marc Torrejon, who were brought in for 4 billion won, and Raúl García, who was acquired for free from Atlético Madrid, were currently leading Racing to be the kings of draws. They would pour out their energy in the early stages of the game, applying tight pressure in the midfield, and when they ran out of steam in the second half, they would be substituted out. That was their strategy. [On the other hand, Real Madrid has prepared a very challenging and experimental tactic. They have fielded Cristiano Ronaldo, Raúl, and Woo Ho-young as a three-top in a 4-3-3 formation.] [It could be a smokescreen in preparation for El Clásico, which is just a week away, but depending on today's result, it might actually be used. Barcelona's analysts must be very busy right now.] The game started dramatically from the beginning. Racing Santander adopted an extremely defensive attitude, while Real Madrid poured energy into their attacks. All attacks started from the midfield. Defensive midfielder Lassana Diarra was responsible for the back, while Xabi Alonso and Yoann Gourcuff took care of ball distribution, building up the play. [The coordination between the two is better than expected. Xabi Alonso needs no introduction, and Yoann Gourcuff is also showing a decent performance. Despite having the worst season at AC Milan last season, he's still proving that he's useful.] [That's right. He's only 23 years old. There's plenty of potential for further growth. He wasn't called the second Zidane for nothing.] Yoann Gourcuff distributed precise passes back and forth with his broad vision. When Pape Diop's pressure came in harshly, he calmly used his decent footwork to escape the pressure. Meanwhile, Xabi Alonso was looking after the three-top in the front. [The front trio of Ronaldo, Raúl, and Woo Ho-young are constantly switching, disrupting Racing's defensive line.] [It's an organic and flexible movement. It could disrupt the flow of ball distribution, but with the solid support of Xabi Alonso in the back, they can move freely.] The first scoring chance also originated from Xabi Alonso's feet. [The ball flows to the side. Cristiano Ronaldo runs to catch it and immediately attempts to break through.] [Jose Crespo rushes to mark Ronaldo.] But the situation unfolded in an instant. Tap. Whizz! With a feint, Ronaldo slightly shook off Jose Crespo and struck a powerful shot. It was his most confident angle, so the ball went in properly. However, it was deflected off the goalkeeper's fingertips and went out of the goal frame. And the finisher was... Clang! It was Ho-young, who had been waiting in front. [Goal! Goal! Woo Ho-young scores his 9th league goal! He might really be a contender for the top scorer this year!] Ooooooh! Loud cheers erupted from behind. However, Ho-young quickly ended his celebration. A complex emotion lingered on his face. Whistle- The game ended with a 2-0 victory for Real Madrid. And Ho-young, without even changing his clothes, went straight to the coach's office. Scolari's question followed, asking why he had come. Ho-young, with a complicated expression, said, \\"I have something to say about the tactics.\\" At that, even Scolari, who had been drinking from a water bottle, looked increasingly troubled."},{"instruction":"사비 알론소가 받으면서 공을 안정적으로 지켜냅니다.] [호날두는 공중에서, 호영은 발밑에서 압박을 벗겨내는군요. 바르셀로나의 선수들이 도통 정신을 못 차리고 있습니다.] [체력만 낭비한 꼴이네요. 그 사이 레알 마드리드는 이미 여유를 되찾았어요.] 과르디올라의 6초 룰이 실패로 돌아간 순간이었다. 그래도 다행인 건 바르셀로나의 수비진이 모두 제자리로 돌아왔다는 것. 하지만 사비 알론소가 여유를 되찾으면서 흐름이 뒤바뀌었다. 찰나간에 일어난 일이었다. 알론소가 고개를 들어 전방을 바라보자, 기다렸다는 듯 공격대형이 삽시간이 뒤바뀌었다. [호날두가 중앙으로 파고듭니다!] 호영은 호날두에게 자리를 내어주고 우측측면으로 뛰어들었다. 그리고 그 자리에 있던 더글라스는 최전방으로 올라가 반 니스텔루이와 투톱을 이루었다. 그로 인해 빈 좌측공간은 아르벨로아가 치고 올라오면서 빈틈없이 메웠다. 마치 서로가 서로를 쫓는 모양새. 압박과 탈압박 능력을 단련시키는 ‘추격자 훈련’이 실전에서 사용되고 있는 것이었다. 추격자 훈련이란, 꼬리 물기처럼 서로가 서로를 따라잡으며 순환하듯 스위칭을 하는 연계플레이다. 보기에는 단순해보여도 연계만 자연스럽게 된다면, 당하는 입장에서는 당황할 수밖에 없다. 아닌 게 아니라, 바르셀로나의 수비진은 이미 허둥지둥 대기 일쑤였다. “자리 고정해! 각자 지역방어로 전환한다! 선수를 보지 말고 공간을 잡아!” 푸욜이 목 놓아 소리치며 수비라인을 조율했지만 선수들이 느끼는 당혹감은 여전했다. 수비가 좌우로 흔들리고 있었다. 해설들도 마찬가지로 당혹감을 감추지 못했다. [도대체 이게 뭐죠?] [역시 이번에도 깜짝 전술을 들고 나왔군요. 일단 바르셀로나의 수비진을 벼랑 끝으로 몰고 가는 데는 성공한 것 같습니다. 하지만 너무 위험한 전략이에요. 2선으로 향하는 패스라도 한 번 끊기면 대형 참사입니다.] 이 전술은 대형 전체가 무너져 내리기 때문에, 기회를 성공시키지 못하면 득보다 실이 더 많은 전술이었다. 턴 오버라도 되는 순간 그대로 위기를 맞이하는 것이나 다름없었다. 하지만 레알 마드리드의 빌드업은 준비된 대로 차곡차곡 진행되었다. 선수들이 끊임없이 움직이며 상대 수비진을 교란시켰다. 그리고 그 한 가운데. 반 니스텔루이가 축의 중심을 맡으면서 상대에게 두려움을 심어주었다. 더욱이 여기서 끝이 아니었다. [레알 마드리드, 다시 한 번 움직입니다!] 기계가 재조립되듯 대형이 재차 변경되었다. 우호영이 전방으로 올라가고 더글라스가 좌측 측면으로 내려앉자, 바르셀로나의 수비라인이 덩달아 요동쳤다. 짧은 찰나, 푸욜과 발데스 사이에 커다란 공간이 생겨나고 말았다. 바로 그 순간이었다. 뻐엉! 사비 알론소의 발이 움직인 것은. [중앙 뒷공간으로 한 번에 연결되는 롱 패스!] [반 니스텔루이와 우호영이 동시에 침투합니다!] 모든 것은 계획한 대로 이뤄졌다. 중간 중간 미흡한 부분이 있었지만 2주간 훈련한 것치고는 매우 뛰어난 성과였다. 여기서 남은 것은 확실한 마무리. 골 결정력이라면 세계 최강이라 불릴만한 반 니스텔루이와 우호영이 최전방에 있었기에 이보다 더 든든할 수 없었다. 그중 공을 받은 것은 호영이었다. 슈팅자세는 눈 깜짝할 사이에 갖춰졌다. 오른쪽 발등으로 원 터치, 왼쪽 발끝으로 투 터치. 그리고 슈팅. 그게 끝이었다. 철렁! [고오오오오올! 골입니다! 우호영이 원더골을 때려 박는군요! 리그 10호 골입니다!] [전반 중반, 선취점을 달성하는 레알 마드리드!] “우워어어어어!” 짜릿한 감각이 전신을 휘감았다. 머리를 싸매가며 구상했던 전술이 들어맞는 이 순간만큼은, 세상 모든 것을 다 가진 기분이었다. 호영은 뒤도 안 보고 스콜라리에게 달려가 득점을 자축했다. [연계 플레이, 패스, 호흡, 슈팅 그 모든 것이 완벽했습니다. 중간에 삐끗하나 했지만 스콜라리의 전술이 결국 들어맞는군요.] [놀랍다는 말밖에는 할 수 없습니다. 가능할 것 같지 않던 전술이 현실이 된 순간이에요.] 충격과 공포. 그 광경에 과르디올라는 아연실색하며 머리를 부여잡았다. 전혀 예상치도 못한 전술. 국가대표 한정 ‘명장’이라는 오명을 가진 스콜라리에게 제대로 한 방 먹은 셈이었다. ‘설마 저것도 우호영의······?’ 오싹한 기분이 들었다. 안 그래도 얼마 남지 않은 머리털이 다 빠져나가는 듯한 기분이었다. 그리고 하프타임 이후에 시작된 후반전. 센터 서클 위에 올라선 호영은 즐라탄을 바라보며 경기에 집중했다. 오늘이 바로 그날이었다.","output":"Xabi Alonso kept the ball secure as he received it. [Ronaldo in the air, Ho-young on the ground, they're both shedding the pressure. Barcelona's players just can't seem to get their heads straight.] [They're only wasting their energy. In the meantime, Real Madrid has already regained their composure.] It was the moment when Guardiola's 6-second rule had failed. Fortunately for Barcelona, their defense had all returned to their positions. But the flow had shifted as Xabi Alonso regained his composure. It all happened in an instant. As Alonso lifted his head to look forward, the attacking formation swiftly changed as if on cue. [Ronaldo is penetrating through the center!] Ho-young gave up his position to Ronaldo and darted to the right flank. Douglas, who had been in that spot, moved up front to form a two-top with Ruud van Nistelrooy. The vacant left space was filled seamlessly as Arbeloa pushed up. It was as if they were chasing each other. The 'chaser training,' which hones the ability to press and evade pressure, was being put into practice in the game. Chaser training is a linked play where players chase each other in a cycle, switching positions like a game of tag. It may look simple, but if the coordination is natural, it can be disconcerting for the opposition. Indeed, Barcelona's defense was already in disarray. \\"Stay in your positions! Switch to zonal defense! Don't watch the players, cover the space!\\" Puyol shouted hoarsely, trying to coordinate the defensive line, but the players' confusion was palpable. The defense was being shaken from side to side. The commentators were equally taken aback. [What on earth is this?] [It seems they've come out with another surprise tactic. They've managed to push Barcelona's defense to the brink. But it's a very risky strategy. If even one pass to the second line is intercepted, it could be a disaster.] This tactic could cause the entire formation to collapse, so if they failed to capitalize on the opportunity, the losses could outweigh the gains. A turnover would mean facing an immediate crisis. However, Real Madrid's buildup proceeded as planned. The players kept moving, disrupting the opposing defense. And in the midst of it all... Van Nistelrooy took charge of the axis, instilling fear in the opposition. And it didn't end there. [Real Madrid is on the move again!] The formation reassembled like a machine being rebuilt. As Ho-young moved up front and Douglas dropped to the left flank, Barcelona's defensive line was thrown into turmoil. In a brief moment, a large space opened up between Puyol and Valdés. That was the moment. Whizz! Xabi Alonso's foot moved. [A long pass connects to the space behind the center!] [Van Nistelrooy and Ho-young both penetrate at the same time!] Everything went according to plan. There were some hiccups, but considering it was only two weeks of training, the results were outstanding. What remained was a definitive finish. With Van Nistelrooy and Ho-young, known for their world-class goal-scoring abilities, at the front, there couldn't be a more solid finish. Ho-young was the one who received the ball. His shooting posture was ready in the blink of an eye. One touch with the right instep, two touches with the left toe. Then the shot. That was the end of it. Clang! [Goaaaaal! Goal! Ho-young slams in a wonder goal! That's his 10th league goal!] [In the middle of the first half, Real Madrid scores the opening goal!] \\"Wowwwww!\\" A thrilling sensation enveloped his entire body. At this moment, when the tactic he had conceived was successful, he felt like he had everything in the world. Ho-young didn't look back and ran to celebrate the goal with Scolari. [The linked play, the passes, the coordination, the shooting, everything was perfect. There was a slight slip, but Scolari's tactics have paid off.] [There's nothing to say but 'amazing.' A tactic that seemed impossible has become reality.] Shock and awe. Guardiola was pale, clutching his head in disbelief. A completely unexpected tactic. It was as if Scolari, who had the unfortunate reputation of being a 'master' only with national teams, had been thoroughly outplayed. 'Could that have been Ho-young's doing...?' A chilling feeling crept over him. It was as if the little hair he had left was about to fall out. And then, in the second half that started after halftime. Ho-young, standing on the center circle, focused on the game, looking at Zlatan. Today was the day."},{"instruction":"Write a humorous story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Judy Hopps waking up one morning to discover that everything in Zootopia but her is missing. She later discovers that Wario has captured everyone and anything in the city and shoved them into a tiny cardboard box, and is attempting to sell the cardboard box on the Zootopian version of eBay (but he fails since he also stole the Zootopia eBay servers). Judy Hopps manages to defeat Wario and rescues everyone and everything in Zootopia. Hilariously, the narrator has been kidnapped too, so the story is narrated by Judy until she rescues the narrator.","output":"Once upon a sunny morning in Zootopia, Officer Judy Hopps awoke with her usual spring in her step, ready to embrace another bustling day in the diverse metropolis she called home. Oh, but wait, dear reader—I’m Judy, I suppose I should be the one telling the story since our usual narrator is... currently unavailable. As I was saying, I stretched my little bunny legs and rolled out of bed, fully expecting the hum of the city to greet my fuzzy ears. Except, it was quiet. Eerily quiet. I twitched my nose – something was definitely amiss. Hopping over to the window, I grasped the curtains with a paw and yanked them open, only to be met with... absolutely nothing. The buildings, the noisy cars, the hustle and bustle of animal folk – every single thing and critter, gone! Panicked, I scampered outside, my fur standing on end. \\"Nick?\\" I called out for my sly fox partner, but no answer. Bogo? Clawhauser? Anyone? Silence. It felt like I had fallen down a rabbit hole into a very empty, very quiet wonderland. But officers don't panic – we act. So with my trusty carrot recorder in paw—I mean, I'm documenting this insane day for posterity—I set out to crack the case. The trail led me to, of all places, an old cardboard box sitting suspiciously in the middle of where Savanna Central used to be. And near that box, was none other than... Wario! Yes, you heard me, Wario from the video games, chuckling to himself as he slapped a ludicrously low price tag on the box and attempted to list it on what should have been the Zootopian eBay (but I guess he stole that too, which explains his unsuccessful sales venture). \\"Stop right there, Wario!\\" I yelled, ready to apprehend him. \\"What did you do to Zootopia?\\" With a sneer, he boasted, \\"I used my incredible Wario technology to shrink everyone and everything, and I put it all in this box! I’m going to sell it for a fortune!” Needless to say, his business acumen was lacking, given the glaring logistical issues. I knew I had to act fast, he still had that shrinky-thingy after all. \\"Not on my watch, you won't!\\" I bellowed... which, in retrospect, is less intimidating when you're a bunny yelling at a plump, greedy video game villain. A chase ensued – I dodged and weaved, ducked under a stomp, leaped over a bizarre garlic attack (yes, garlic, who knew?). And then, when the moment was right, I pounced and cuffed him, with some very acrobatic moves I’d been practicing for special occasions like this. Inside that tiny box, I found everyone and everything from Zootopia, stacked so efficiently you'd think it was done by someone with ample experience in Tetris. \\"Alright everyone, bear with me,\\" I said, as I figured out Wario's device, un-shrinking the Zootopians and our dear city. It was... a hare-raising experience. Buildings popped back up, animals grew to their proper sizes, and before long, the sounds of Zootopia’s daily grind filled the air once more. Our missing narrator could finally take over, but not before I gave him a stern look. \\"Next time, try to avoid capture, would you?\\" With Wario now under lock and key, life in Zootopia returned to normal. If by normal you mean the occasional wacky adventure involving video game anti-heroes, shrinking gadgets, and, well, me – Officer Judy Hopps, temporary narrator and full-time hero. And so ends this hare-larious chapter in Zootopia's history, which I have now personally recorded... you know, just in case our narrator goes missing again."},{"instruction":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man reading fifty shades of grey to his friends as a joke.

It is a relatively common form of cancer, affecting both men and women, particularly those above the age of 55. The disease usually begins in the cells lining the inside of the bladder, known as urothelial cells, but can also develop in other types of cells present in the bladder wall. Bladder cancer is often characterized by the abnormal growth and division of these cells, forming masses or tumors within the bladder. These tumors can be non-invasive (limited to the inner layers of the bladder) or invasive (spreading into deeper layers or surrounding tissues). Although the exact causes of bladder cancer are not fully understood, certain risk factors have been identified. Exposure to tobacco smoke, industrial chemicals (such as aromatic amines and arsenic), and radiation, as well as a history of chronic bladder inflammation or recurrent urinary tract infections, are known to increase the likelihood of developing bladder cancer. Genetics and a family history of the disease also play a role in its development. The symptoms of bladder cancer may vary depending on the stage and extent of the disease. Early-stage bladder cancer may produce little to no noticeable symptoms, while more advanced cases can present with blood in the urine (hematuria), frequent urination, urinary urgency, pain or discomfort during urination, lower back pain, and unexplained weight loss. Diagnosing bladder cancer often involves a combination of physical examination, medical history review, laboratory tests, and imaging studies such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A definitive diagnosis is usually confirmed by a procedure called cystoscopy, during which a thin tube with a camera is inserted into the bladder to visualize any abnormal areas. Treatment options for bladder cancer depend on the stage and aggressiveness of the disease. Early-stage bladder cancer is often treated through minimally invasive procedures such as transurethral resection, where the tumor is removed via the urethra using a specialized instrument. For more advanced cases, surgical removal of the bladder (cystectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these approaches may be employed. Prognosis for bladder cancer varies widely depending on various factors, including the stage of the disease upon diagnosis, the overall health of the individual, and the effectiveness of the chosen treatment. Regular follow-up appointments, ongoing monitoring, and lifestyle modifications can be crucial in managing the condition and reducing the risk of recurrence. Overall, bladder cancer poses a significant health challenge, but with early detection, appropriate treatment, and ongoing care, the outcomes can be improved, and the quality of life for individuals affected by this disease can be enhanced."},{"instruction":"make it shorter make it 1 and ahalf paragrpahs","output":"Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the bladder.

Symptoms may include blood in the urine, frequent urination, pain during urination, and weight loss. Diagnosis involves physical examination, medical history review, lab tests, and imaging studies. Treatment options range from minimally invasive procedures to surgical removal of the bladder, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Prognosis depends on various factors, but with early detection and appropriate treatment, outcomes can be improved. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential for managing the disease."},{"instruction":"Description of bladder cancer What are its signs/symptoms? What does it look like? How is the healthy tissue altered? How does this link to the signs/symptoms?","output":"Bladder cancer is a type of cancer that affects the tissues of the bladder, the organ responsible for storing urine. It typically presents with signs and symptoms such as blood in the urine (hematuria), frequent urination, pain or discomfort during urination, and unexplained weight loss. In terms of appearance, bladder cancer often manifests as abnormal growths or tumors within the bladder. These tumors can be non-invasive, meaning they are limited to the inner layers of the bladder, or invasive, spreading into deeper layers and surrounding tissues. Healthy bladder tissue is altered as bladder cancer cells multiply and divide uncontrollably. This abnormal growth leads to the formation of these tumors or growths. As the tumor grows, it can obstruct the normal flow of urine through the bladder, causing symptoms such as frequent urination and pain during urination. Additionally, the presence of blood in the urine occurs when the cancerous cells invade the blood vessels within the bladder, leading to bleeding. It is important to note that the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer can be similar to other benign conditions, such as urinary tract infections or bladder stones. Therefore, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional if any of the aforementioned symptoms persist or worsen, as early detection and diagnosis can greatly influence the treatment and prognosis of bladder cancer."},{"instruction":"make it only 125 words","output":"Bladder cancer is a type of cancer affecting the tissues of the bladder, which stores urine.

Descended from a long line of powerful sorcerers, Hajime had the weight of a great legacy resting on his shoulders. The Kashimo family had made significant contributions to the world of sorcery, and Hajime was determined to live up to his ancestors' reputation. From a very young age, Hajime displayed immense talent and a deep understanding of cursed techniques. His proficiency in jujutsu surpassed many of his peers, and news of his abilities spread throughout the Jujutsu world. Some hailed him as the next prodigy, while others feared his potential to become a formidable force. As Hajime's reputation grew, so did the expectations placed upon him. The Kyoto High School, renowned for its rigorous training and prominent sorcerers, eagerly awaited his arrival. Both students and teachers anticipated witnessing the extraordinary abilities of the young Kashimo. On his first day at Kyoto High, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement. The students whispered in hushed tones as they caught glimpses of Hajime's arrival. Dressed in the traditional black sorcerer uniform, he exuded an air of confidence mingled with a mysterious aura. Amidst the chatter, fellow first-year student, Megumi Fushiguro, caught sight of Hajime. Megumi was also a prodigious sorcerer, blessed with an innate talent for summoning shikigami. Curious to uncover the truth behind the rumors, Megumi approached Hajime, looking to strike up a conversation. Hajime, however, appeared aloof and uninterested in making friends. His dedication to sorcery consumed his every thought, leaving little room for anything else. Megumi persisted, sensing that beneath Hajime's cold exterior lay a yearning for connection. Over time, Megumi's persistence paid off. Hajime began to warm up to his fellow first-year student, recognizing their similar dedication and passion for sorcery. A bond began to form between them, built on respect and a shared pursuit of becoming stronger. Their newfound friendship became the catalyst for a remarkable turn of events. Word reached Kyoto High that a powerful curse, known as Itsumura, had awakened and was wreaking havoc across the city. Its power surpassed any they had ever encountered, leaving the sorcerers in fear. Determined to protect innocent lives, the duo, along with their classmates, embarked on a perilous journey to face the Itsumura curse. As they delved deeper into the mysteries surrounding the curse's origin, they discovered a dark secret. Itsumura was a vengeful spirit, longing for revenge against the sorcerers who had wronged its ancestors centuries ago. Realizing that defeating the curse would require more than just their individual talents, Megumi and Hajime rallied the entire student body of Kyoto High. They united sorcerers from different backgrounds, each bringing their unique skills and techniques to the battle. With their combined strength and unwavering determination, the students confronted Itsumura in a climactic showdown. Hajime, inheriting the wisdom and knowledge passed down by his ancestors, tapped into his full potential, using his newfound powers to weaken the curse. As the battle raged on, Megumi's shikigami, empowered by Hajime's support, struck a decisive blow, sealing the curse once and for all. Together, they had proven that even the most powerful curses could be defeated through unity, resilience, and a deep understanding of the past. News of the students' remarkable victory spread throughout the Jujutsu world, further solidifying the Kashimo legacy. Though Hajime had come into Kyoto High with the burden of expectations, he had managed to forge his own path, using his strengths to protect the ones he loved. The tale of Hajime Kashimo and Megumi Fushiguro became a legend, inspiring future generations of sorcerers to work together and embrace their unique abilities. Their story taught them that strength is not just measured by individual power but also by the bonds forged with comrades. In the end, the Kashimo name became synonymous with courage, unity, and the unyielding determination to protect humanity from the ever-looming threat of curses. The tale of the Legacy of Kashimo stood as a testament to the enduring power of family, friendship, and the relentless pursuit of justice in the Jujutsu world."},{"instruction":"Zolang de zorgaanbieder aan zijn plicht voldoet om goede zorg te leveren, kan hij zelf bepalen voor welke werkzaamheden hij vrijwilligers inzet.

Please explain and provide contrasting examples besides generative LLM interpretation to help provide perspective.","output":"Interpreting the outputs of generative large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3, can be seen as involving both epistemic and ontological aspects, but it is important to clarify what each term typically means: **Epistemic Experience**: This relates to knowledge and understanding. An epistemic experience involves gaining information, learning, or expanding one’s knowledge base. The focus is on the process of knowing and understanding. In the context of interpreting generative LLM outputs, an epistemic experience would involve understanding the patterns, language, and meanings that the model is producing. It’s about the acquisition of knowledge regarding how the model responds to prompts and the insights one can gain about a model's capabilities and limitations. **Ontological Experience**: This involves the nature of being, existence, or reality. Ontological experiences are about how something exists, or the fundamental characteristics of a particular entity. When interpreting outputs of generative LLMs in terms of ontology, one is dealing with the nature of the model as a computational artifact, the existence of the model as a non-conscious entity that simulates human-like responses, and the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence creating language and content that may seem to have meaning. **Interpreting Generative LLM Outputs**: 1. **Epistemic Aspect**: When you ask a generative LLM a question and it provides an answer, you are engaging in an epistemic process. You are interpreting the data (the answer) to expand your knowledge. You also learn about the model's capacity to understand and generate language patterns that are coherent and contextually appropriate. 2. **Ontological Aspect**: When you reflect on the nature of the generative LLM's responses, considering questions like \\"What does it mean for a machine to generate human-like text?\\" or \\"Do these generated texts have 'meaning' in the same way as human-generated texts?\\" you are engaging with ontological questions. You are not merely seeking knowledge but also understanding the state-of-being of the LLM's outputs and the nature of machine intelligence. **Contrasting Examples**: 1. **Epistemic Contrast (Learning a New Language)**: When a person learns a new language, they are having an epistemic experience. They are acquiring new knowledge about grammar, vocabulary, and cultural nuances. 2. **Ontological Contrast (Meditation)**: When someone meditates and reflects on their sense of self or the nature of consciousness, they might be said to be having an ontological experience. They are exploring the fundamental aspects of their being, rather than acquiring new factual knowledge. In summary, while interpreting the outputs of generative LLMs involves both epistemic and ontological aspects, the balance between the two can vary based on the purpose of the interpretation and the perspective of the interpreter. Most day-to-day interpretations will lean towards the epistemic, focusing on what we can learn from the models’ responses, with occasional ventures into ontology when we ponder the deeper implications of artificial intelligence and its relationship to human cognition and creativity."},{"instruction":"translate to english","output":"It appears you may have forgotten to include the text you want translated.

Twin Tigers Battle (1) Nord Palace Hotel, located in Belfast, Northern Ireland. A small-scale luxury hotel used by many prestigious clubs around the world for off-season training, with a soccer training field nearby suitable for practice. In addition, guests are entitled to receive the best services from the hotel, including hot springs, massages, body care, and mental care, 24 hours a day. In other words, it was an off-season resort training ground where one could enjoy both relaxation and training at the same time. Due to such excellent facilities, there was always fierce competition, but for the next two weeks, the entire Real Madrid squad was scheduled to use it. Training began the morning after their arrival. \\"¡Vamos, Blancos. Good morning.\\" As the coaching staff and players gathered at the entrance of the endless running field, Scolari spoke up. And the players responded in kind. ¡Vamos, Blancos. Scolari had made it a point to use this phrase for team unity in the morning, at lunch, in the evening, and when saying goodbye. It was Scolari's earnest wish for the Champions League victory. And for good reason, as he had been disgracefully dismissed from the prestigious Chelsea in the EPL at the end of last year. To wash away that humiliation and continue the reputation of a 'World Cup-winning coach,' he had to achieve good results this time. The first step was to take control of the squad and rebuild. Real Madrid was in turmoil at the moment. Until the transfer window closed on August 31st, no one could be sure who would be signed or released. The only players who had completed transfers to Real Madrid were Cristiano Ronaldo and Xabi Alonso. The exact list of players to be cut would be finalized after the off-season training. No one, regardless of nationality, race, or age, could feel safe. Players who had not yet renewed their contracts were all considered for release. Even though President Calderon had a fondness for the Dutch connection, Scolari planned to ruthlessly let go of any players he deemed unnecessary. Whether it was Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, or Ruud van Nistelrooy, there were no exceptions. The power was in Scolari's hands. And the training began in a solemn atmosphere. The first training was physical conditioning. During the off-season, the focus is usually on intense training to maximize fitness, to ensure that players can endure the entire season. \\"Phew.\\" \\"Ha, ha...\\" The players ran and ran again. For two days, it was a continuous repetition. They spent the day running like marathon runners without even touching a ball. The same routine continued on the second day and lasted until the third day. On the third day. The atmosphere at the training ground was drastically different from before. The absence of Zinedine Zidane and Roberto Carlos had changed the team. Zidane, nearing retirement, was enjoying a vacation with his family, and Carlos, whose contract had expired, planned to return to his homeland without renewing. The players were also different in the clearly changed atmosphere from last season. While the existing players were very close, there was an invisible wall between the young players from Castilla and the newcomers. Tensions were inevitable. Especially today, interval training was conducted, where players ran back and forth to the sound of a beep. As time passed, players began to drop out one by one, exhausted. But in the end, two players remained. \\"Those two are left again today.\\" \\"Did Young and Chris always have such good stamina?\\" It was Woo Ho-young and Ronaldo. Neither wanted to lose to the other and refused to give up until the end. It was a battle to see whether the rolling stone would dislodge the fixed stone or the fixed stone would knock away the rolling stone. \\"Stubborn, so stubborn. It's only the third day of training; aren't they pushing themselves too hard?\\" \\"Exactly. At this rate, both might collapse.\\" The players who had given up earlier admired the two's mental strength. \\"I hope Young wins.\\" \\"I agree.\\" It was an interesting development. Most players were rooting for Ho-young, but there were also players who stood in the middle, like Pepe. 'This is tricky. A rivalry between Woo Ho-young and Ronaldo... I expected it, but...' As a member of the Portuguese national team, he had been friends with Ronaldo for a long time and found himself in a difficult position. 'Unless one of them ends it, neither will give up.' The two, who were second to none in competitiveness, seemed ready to keep going until their hearts burst. Beep! \\"Haah...\\" Beep! \\"Hoo...\\" There was no yielding. Especially in front of all their teammates, neither could afford to lose. It seemed it wouldn't end until one of them collapsed from exhaustion. But willpower and competitiveness alone couldn't overcome physical limits. Ronaldo's face was so red it looked like it might burst at any moment. In contrast, Ho-young's face wasn't quite at that level yet. The combination of Park Ji-seok's two hearts (U) and Nedved's extraordinary stamina (S+3) had resulted in the creation of 'The Unstoppable Heart (SU),' which helped turn Ho-young's weakness, his stamina, into a strength. But in the end. Beep- The seemingly endless battle between the two came to an end. \\"Stop!\\" Scolari, who had been silently watching the prideful duel, intervened. It would have been a problem if they had pushed themselves too hard and gotten injured. Since it was still early in the training, it was necessary to manage their condition. Scolari, playing with his trademark mustache, stood in front of the two. \\"Who told you to push yourselves so hard? Didn't I say to use only 85% of your stamina since it's the beginning of training?\\" \\"Phew... That's what we did.\\" \\"Hmm?\\" Ho-young answered confidently. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't even give a proper response as he was catching his breath. Scolari shook his head and spoke. \\"Competition is good. But you need to know when and where to draw the line.\\" \\"Understood.\\" \\"Yes...\\" However, the competition between the two continued thereafter. One week into training. Scolari was in a dilemma. The main purpose of off-season training was to improve performance, but it was also to identify and address issues. However, since the start of training, his worries had only increased because of Woo Ho-young and Ronaldo. Of course, he didn't expect their combination to work perfectly from the start. Harmony is something that naturally develops over time. But Scolari's thoughts had changed as of yesterday. The coexistence of Woo Ho-young and Ronaldo seemed more difficult than anticipated. The two were like water and oil, unable to mix."},{"instruction":"203. 격변한 마드리드(1) 알프레도 디 스테파노. 아르헨티나, 스페인, 콜롬비아 3중국적을 가지고 있는 그는 얼마 전 아르헨티나와 콜롬비아에서 휴가를 보냈다. 마냥 쉰 것은 아니었다. 레알 마드리드의 명예회장답게, 쉬면서도 클럽의 상황을 끊임없이 주시하였다. 현 상황이 말이 아니었기 때문이다. 칼데론을 포함한 보드진은, 페레즈가 기반을 쌓아놓았던 사업을 이어가느라 정신이 없었고, 스콜라리는 선수단을 자신의 팀으로 만드느라 눈코 뜰 새 없이 바빴다. 피스컵 우승이라는 결과만 봤을 땐 문제될 게 아무것도 없었으나, 경기내용면으로 봤을 땐 문제가 많았다. 스테파노가 느끼기엔 그러했다. 호베르투 카를로스와 미첼 살가도가 빠지면서 수비진이 흔들렸고, 지네딘 지단이 은퇴하면서 중원의 버팀목이 사라졌다. 보기만 해도 안정감이 느껴지던 ‘노련미’라는 것이 더 이상 느껴지지 않았다. 세계 최고의 딥 라잉 플레이메이커(Deep-lying playmaker) ‘사비 알론소’가 팀에 합류했지만, 아직 팀의 빌드업을 완전히 책임질 만큼 팀에 융화되지는 못한 상태였다. 2선과 공격진도 마찬가지. 여전히 라울이라는 무시무시한 공격수가 버텨주곤 있었지만, 호날두와 우호영이 완벽한 시너지를 발휘하지 못하고 있었다. 이는 언론의 표적이 되기 십상이었다. 아니나 다를까, 평소 레알 마드리드에게 적대적이었던 각 언론들은 기다렸다는 듯이 음모론을 형성하면서 구단을 공격하고 있었다. 레알 마드리드는 이 모든 것을 안정화시킬 필요가 있었다. 그래서 스테파노가 귀국하자마자 한 일은 선수단을 만나는 것이었다. 이러한 사실에, 기자들은 스테파노가 호날두를 먼저 대면할 것이라고 생각했다. 하지만 실상은 달랐다. 가장 먼저 약속을 잡은 것은 호날두가 아닌 우호영이었다. 8월 3일. 발데베바스에 위치한 알프레도 디 스테파노 스타디움(Alfredo di Stefano Stadium). 텅텅 빈 6천여 석의 관중석 한 가운데 두 명의 남자가 앉아있었다. 세월이 느껴지는 백발의 노인과 깔끔한 정장을 갖춰 입은 소년이었다. 가벼운 인사 후 입을 뗀 것은 스테파노였다. “세월이 참 빨라.” 호영은 말없이 그의 목소리를 경청하였다. 그와의 만남은 생각보다 떨렸다. 크리스마스와 새해를 기념하는 공식석상에서 두어 번 만난 적은 있어도 단 둘이 만나는 것은 처음이었으니까. 스테파노가 먼저 말했다. “이렇게 단둘이 만나는 건 처음이구먼. 내가 뭐하는 사람인지 따로 소개를 해야 하나?” “그럴 리가요.” “아닌 게 아니라 요즘 마드리드의 아이들은 펠레와 마라도나만 알지 나는 잘 모르거든.” “하지만 전 아니에요. 저희 할아버지께서 자주 하시는 말씀이 있거든요. 스테파노 같은 선수가 되라고요.” “자네 할아버지가 내 팬이었나보군.” “광팬이셨죠. 지금도 마찬가지고요.” “끌끌.” 한 차례 가볍게 웃은 스테파노는 고동색 지팡이를 짚으며 자리에서 일어났다. “자네가 여기에 온지 얼마나 되었지?” “거의 4년 되었습니다.” “나이는?” “열여섯입니다.” “허!” 탁탁. 스테파노는 지팡이를 들어 드넓은 필드를 가리켰다. “4년이란 시간은 이곳에서 매우 긴 시간이지. 이삼년도 제대로 버티지 못하는 녀석들이 널렸으니까. 그만큼 자네는 이미 많은 것을 이뤘어.” “감사합니다.” “하지만 지금부터가 진짜 시작이지.” 스테파노는 추억에 잠긴 채 말을 이었다. “나는 레알 마드리드가 좋아. 이곳은 독재로부터 흘린 피와 땀이 얽혀있는 역사적인 공간이지 않은가. 그런 위대한 곳에 내 이름을 본떠서 경기장을 지어준 것 또한 고마운 일이지.” 프랑코 정권의 스페인독재가 끝난 이후, 1950년대에 선수 생활을 했던 그로서는 감회가 남다를 수밖에 없었다. 그 시절엔 그야말로 축구가 전쟁이나 다름없었으니까. “우리는 매일같이 공을 차며 호흡을 맞췄었지. 바로 이곳에서 말일세.” 스테파노가 양팔을 벌리며 말을 이었다. “마드리디스모의 열정. 후아니토의 정신. 하양의 투쟁. 그것들이 한데 얽혀있는 곳이 바로 이곳, 레알 마드리드야. 하지만.” 서론은 끝났다. 스테파노는 호영에게 고개를 돌리며 본론으로 들어갔다. “이런 위대한 곳이 비난을 받는다는 것은 용납할 수 없는 일일세. 동감하는가?” “물론입니다. 저 또한 클럽에 충성심을 가지고 있으니까요. 그래서 더 열심히 하고 있고요.” “충성심이라, 이 바닥에서의 충성심은 자본이 된지 오래야. 내가 말하는 건 충성심의 문제가 아닐세.” 스테파노의 미간이 팍 좁혀들었다. 입가에는 자글자글한 주름이 졌다. 곧바로 무거운 목소리가 흘러나왔다. “호날두와 경쟁을 해서는 안 돼. 경쟁도 수준을 맞춰서 하는 거지.” “저한테 하시는 말씀입니까?” “여기, 자네 말고 또 누가 있는가?” 이게 갑자기 웬 생뚱맞은 소리인가? 한 수 물러나 호날두에게 주인공의 자리를 양보하라는 것일까? 아예 예상하지 못한 답은 아니었지만 호영으로서는 자존심이 상하는 발언이었다. 호날두는 이제 막 레알에 입단한 선수가 아니던가. 그에 반해 호영은 올해로 벌써 5년차다. 레알 마드리드와 카스티야, 후베닐에 가져다준 우승트로피만 해도 몇 개인지 모른다. 그럼에도 호날두를 먼저 챙겨준다는 것은 호영으로서도 쉽게 납득할 수 없었다. 배신감이 느껴지는 게 당연했다. ‘호날두는 유럽인이고 난 아시아인이라서?’ 머릿속에 그런 생각이 떠오르자, 호영은 저도 모르게 얼굴이 살짝 경직되었다. 하지만 그 직후. “잘 들어보게.” 스테파노가 내뱉은 말이 호영을 더욱 경악하게 만들었다. “경쟁이란 것은, 밑 사람이 윗사람을 따라잡을 때나 큰 득을 보는 게지. 그러니 자네는 상대를 잘못 잡았어.” “그럼 그 말씀은···.” “자네는 호날두보다 더 높은 급의 선수를 목표로 삼고 경쟁을 치러야한다는 것일세.” 충격적인 말. 다시 말해, 스테파노는 호날두보다 호영을 더 높게 본다는 뜻이었다. “정말 그렇게 생각하시는 겁니까?” “자네는 아직도 자네에 대해서 모르는군. 축구는 잘하는데 본질을 보는 눈은 부족해. 자신과 상대의 정확한 실력차이를 꿰뚫고 있다면 심리전에도 유용하게 쓸 수 있는데 말이야.” “예. 무슨 말씀인지 잘 알겠습니다.” 호영은 영혼이 반쯤 나간 표정을 애써 감췄다. 그러자 스테파노가 자리에 편히 앉으며 대화를 이어갔다. “진심일세. 어제 자네의 경기를 보고 깨달았어. 볼을 다루는 기술만큼은 세상 그 어느 누구도 따라올 자가 없다고 말이지. 더욱이 잠재력 또한 호날두보다 한 수 위야.","output":"203. Turbulent Madrid (1) Alfredo Di Stefano. Holding triple nationality from Argentina, Spain, and Colombia, he had recently spent a vacation in Argentina and Colombia. It wasn't just a break. True to his title as the honorary president of Real Madrid, he kept a constant watch on the club's situation even while resting. The current situation was dire. The board, including Calderon, was preoccupied with continuing the business foundations laid by Perez, and Scolari was too busy turning the squad into his own team to have a moment's rest. There seemed to be no problem based on the result of winning the Peace Cup, but there were many issues when looking at the content of the games. That's how Stefano felt. The defense was shaken with the departure of Roberto Carlos and Michel Salgado, and the midfield's backbone disappeared with Zinedine Zidane's retirement. The 'experience' that used to give a sense of stability was no longer felt. The world's best deep-lying playmaker, 'Xabi Alonso,' had joined the team, but he had not yet fully integrated into the team to take complete responsibility for the build-up. The same was true for the second line and the attack. Although the formidable striker Raul was still holding up, Cristiano Ronaldo and Woo Ho-young were not exhibiting perfect synergy. This was bound to become a target for the media. Sure enough, the media, which had always been hostile to Real Madrid, were attacking the club with conspiracy theories as if they had been waiting for the opportunity. Real Madrid needed to stabilize all of this. So, the first thing Stefano did upon returning home was to meet with the squad. Given this fact, journalists thought Stefano would first confront Ronaldo. But the reality was different. The first appointment he made was not with Ronaldo, but with Woo Ho-young. August 3rd. Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium, located in Valdebebas. Two men sat in the middle of the empty 6,000-seat stands. An old man with white hair showing his years and a boy in a neat suit. After a light greeting, Stefano was the first to speak. \\"Time flies so fast.\\" Ho-young listened to his voice without a word. Meeting him was more nerve-wracking than expected. Although they had met a couple of times at official events celebrating Christmas and New Year, this was the first time they had met alone. Stefano spoke first. \\"It's our first time meeting alone like this. Should I introduce myself separately, explaining who I am?\\" \\"There's no need for that.\\" \\"It's not that there isn't a need. These days, the kids in Madrid only know Pele and Maradona, not so much about me.\\" \\"But I'm not one of them. My grandfather often says to me, 'Be a player like Stefano.'\\" \\"Your grandfather was a fan of mine?\\" \\"He was a huge fan. And he still is.\\" \\"Chuckle.\\" After a light laugh, Stefano stood up, leaning on his dark brown cane. \\"How long have you been here?\\" \\"Almost four years.\\" \\"And your age?\\" \\"Sixteen.\\" \\"Ah!\\" Tap, tap. Stefano lifted his cane and pointed to the vast field. \\"Four years is a very long time here. There are plenty of guys who can't even last two or three years. That means you've already achieved a lot.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"But the real start is from now on.\\" Stefano continued, lost in memories. \\"I like Real Madrid. This place is a historic space intertwined with the blood and sweat shed from dictatorship, isn't it? I'm also grateful that they named a stadium after me in such a great place.\\" Having played in the 1950s after the end of Franco's dictatorship in Spain, he had a special sentiment. Back then, soccer was practically no different from war. \\"We used to breathe together every day, kicking the ball. Right here in this place.\\" Stefano continued, spreading his arms. \\"The passion of Madridismo. The spirit of Juanito. The struggle of the whites. All these things are intertwined right here, at Real Madrid. But.\\" The introduction was over. Stefano turned his head to Ho-young and moved on to the main point. \\"It's unacceptable for such a great place to receive criticism. Do you agree?\\" \\"Of course. I also have loyalty to the club. That's why I'm working even harder.\\" \\"Loyalty, huh? In this business, loyalty has long become capital. What I'm talking about isn't a matter of loyalty.\\" Stefano's brows furrowed. Wrinkles formed around his mouth. A heavy voice followed immediately. \\"You shouldn't compete with Ronaldo. Competition should be done at the right level.\\" \\"Are you saying this to me?\\" \\"Who else is here but you?\\" What was this sudden, unexpected remark? Was he suggesting that Ho-young step back and yield the leading role to Ronaldo? Although it wasn't an entirely unexpected answer, it was a statement that hurt Ho-young's pride. After all, Ronaldo had just joined Real, hadn't he? On the other hand, Ho-young was already in his fifth year. He had brought several trophies to Real Madrid, Castilla, and Juvenil. Despite this, prioritizing Ronaldo first was something Ho-young couldn't easily accept. It was natural to feel betrayed. 'Is it because Ronaldo is European and I'm Asian?' As such thoughts crossed his mind, Ho-young's face stiffened without him realizing it. But immediately after. \\"Listen carefully.\\" The words Stefano uttered shocked Ho-young even more. \\"Competition is only beneficial when the lower-ranked person catches up to the higher-ranked one. So, you've chosen the wrong opponent.\\" \\"Then what you're saying is...\\" \\"You should aim for a player of a higher caliber than Ronaldo and compete with that goal in mind.\\" Shocking words. In other words, Stefano considered Ho-young to be of a higher caliber than Ronaldo. \\"Do you really think so?\\" \\"You still don't know yourself. You're good at soccer, but you lack the eye for the essence. If you could see the exact difference in skill between yourself and your opponent, it would be useful even in psychological warfare.\\" \\"Yes. I understand what you're saying.\\" Ho-young tried to hide his half-lost expression. Then Stefano sat back comfortably and continued the conversation. \\"I'm serious. After watching your game yesterday, I realized that no one in the world can match your ball-handling skills. Moreover, your potential is also a notch above Ronaldo's.\\""},{"instruction":"205. 수준의 차이(1) [전반전은 그야말로 레알 마드리드가 압도하고 있습니다. 선수들의 장점이 확실히 드러나고 있어요.] [의심의 여지가 없죠. 우호영이 지금까지 5km를 뛰면서 아주 훌륭한 활동량을 보여줬어요. 4.6km를 뛴 크리스티아누 호날두도 팀에 큰 도움이 되고 있고요. 무엇보다 둘의 호흡이 생각보다 괜찮았다는 생각이 듭니다. 또 사비 알론소의 빌드업 능력도 좋았네요.] 모든 것이 계획대로 이뤄지고 있었다. 선수들 간의 호흡이 완벽하진 않아도 비난을 받을만한 수준은 결코 아니었다. 오히려 단기간 내에 리빌딩을 한 것 치고는 상당히 훌륭했다. 특히 사비 알론소의 패스로부터 시작되는 연계플레이가 매우 돋보였고, 그것을 받아서 창조적인 플레이로 만드는 호영의 활약도 보기 좋았다. 하지만 놀라기엔 아직 일렀다. 전반전이 막바지로 치닫는 가운데, 라울이 나오고 벤제마가 교체투입된 것이었다. “오오!” “벤제마가 나오잖아?” “카림 벤제마!” “시원하게 데뷔골을 터트리자!” 벤제마가 모습을 드러내자 일부 관중들이 환호성을 내질렀다. 캡틴 라울이 빠지고 새로운 이적생이 교체된 것이라고는 믿을 수 없는 광경이었다. 그도 그럴 게, 현재 레알 마드리드의 일부 팬들은 벤제마의 화끈하고 박력 있는 스타일에 흠뻑 빠져있었다. 어쩌면 자연스러운 현상인지도 몰랐다. 최근 몇 년간 레알 마드리드의 공격수들을 생각해보면 답이 나온다. 라울, 호나우두, 호빙요, 이과인, 반 니스텔루이, 안토니오 카사노 등. 카사노를 제외하고는 다들 내성적이고 조용한 이미지의 공격수들이 아닌가. 그러던 차에, 벤제마처럼 거칠고 직설적인 성향의 공격수가 나타나자, 불량식품이 이끌리듯 그의 매력에 푹 빠지게 된 것이었다. ‘그래, 사람들은 나를 원해. 레알 마드리드는 나 같은 공격수를 필요로 한다고.’ 원톱으로 경기장에 나선 벤제마는 남다른 각오를 다졌다. ‘나는 우호영이나 호날두를 받쳐주려고 여기에 온 게 아니야.’ 그가 어릴 적부터 품어온 꿈은 레알 마드리드의 하얀색 유니폼을 입고 뛰는 것이었다. 맨유의 기막힌 제안을 거절한 것도 그 때문이었다. 그만큼 남다른 포부와 야망이 있었다. ‘내가 레알 마드리드의 모든 것을 바꿔놓고 만다.’ 레알 마드리드. 이곳 산티아고 베르나베우를 자신의 발아래에 두고 싶었다. 주어진 상황은 완벽했다. 현재 레알 마드리드의 골수팬들은 페레즈에게 실망했고, 페레즈가 떠난 것에 한 번 더 실망한 상태였다. 더욱이 리빌딩을 하면서 팀이 분열하기에 이르렀다. 그 가운데, 벤제마는 팀을 통합하여 레알 마드리드의 영웅이 되고 싶었다. 바로 ‘실력’으로 말이다. ‘꼭 해내고 만다.’ 벤제마는 저 아래에 서있는 호영을 노려보며 목표를 되새겼다. 바로 그 순간이었다. 둘 사이에 묘한 긴장감이 흐른 것은. 그리고 호영의 눈매를 매섭게 구부러진 것은. [카림 벤제마] 보유재능 -예술적인 연계 플레이(S-) -탁월한 위치 선정(S-) -허를 찌르는 공간침투(A+3) -정교한 퍼스트 터치(A+2) -타오르는 승부욕(A+2) -물불 안 가리는 대담함(A-) (더 보기) (조건을 만족할 시 한 가지 재능을 탐할 수 있습니다.) (S등급 이상은 히든조건을 달성해야 탐할 수 있습니다.) (조건1: 경기에서 승리하기) (조건2: 각자 공격 포인트 1점씩 기록하기) (히든조건: 재능 1개 이상을 탐할 시 개방) 카림 벤제마. 비록 아직 U급 재능은 없었지만, 볼 컨트롤에 관련된 A급 재능을 시작으로 S급까지 모조리 섭렵할 수 있을 것 같았다. ‘예술적인 연계플레이는 움직임으로 통합되는 재능인가?’ 모르긴 몰라도 많은 것을 탐할 수 있는 선수임에 확실했다. 경기는 이윽고 재개되었다. 탁. [가슴으로 골킥을 받아낸 우호영, 뒤쪽의 사비 알론소에게 공을 내어줍니다.] [벤제마가 전방으로 쏜살같이 뛰어가는군요.] 흐름이 뒤바뀌었다. 지난 시즌까지 볼 수 있었던 노장들의 노련함 대신, 경기장은 젊은 에너지로 가득 차있었다. 데포르티보에게 공을 빼앗기면 그 즉시 거센 압박을 가하여 다시 탈환해냈다. 이것만 보자면 과르디올라의 6초 룰과 비슷해 보이지만, 이는 스콜라리가 자신의 스타일로 새롭게 구현해낸 전술이었다. 공을 빼앗기면 바로 탈취한다는 점에서는 같지만, 그와 동시에 미드필더진의 기동력을 대폭 높이는 것이 특징이었다. [4-2-3-1 포메이션의 장점을 살려, 역습의 효율을 최대화하겠다는 목적이 보이는군요.] [그렇습니다. 레알 마드리드의 전방 압박이 상당히 강하네요. 마치 바르셀로나의 전술을 표방한 것처럼 말이죠.] [숨 막히네요. 데포르티보의 선수들이 좀처럼 밖으로 나오질 못하고 있습니다.] 그러자 경기의 흐름이 또 한 번 뒤바뀌었다. 상대방이 수비진에서 공을 돌리며 시간을 끌 땐, 압박의 강도를 전체적으로 낮춰 상대의 진출을 유도해냈다. 이것이 약팀을 상대하는 스콜라리의 방법이었다. 경기는 그의 예측대로 흘러가고 있었다. 경계를 늦춰 상대가 나오기를 기다렸다가, 때가 되면 허리를 끊어 재차 역습을 시도했다. [간결하게 들어가는 마하마두 디아라의 태클! 흘러나온 공을 사비 알론소가 잡습니다.] 사비 알론소는 흘러나온 공을 잡자마자 후방을 바라보았다. 바로 전방으로 보내기에는 여유가 없었기 때문이다. 패스는 후방의 메르테사커에게 전달되었다. 탁! 페어 메르테사커(Per Mertesacker). 그는 2미터에 달하는 신장과는 어울리지 않는, 지능적인 타입의 커맨더형 수비수였다. 뿐만 아니라 패스에 대한 기본기와 시야를 기본적으로 갖춘 덕분에, 후방 빌드업에도 일가견이 있었다. 특히 이런 상황에서 어디로 패스를 보내야하는지 육감적으로 알고 있었다. ‘저기다.’ 메르테사커의 시야에 한 선수가 들어왔다. 중앙에서 2선을 향해 박차고 올라가는 우호영이었다. 메르테사커는 곧장 결단을 내렸다. ‘가능해.’ 지난 한 달 간 합을 맞춰본 우호영이라면 충분히 가능할 것이라 생각했다.","output":"205. The Difference in Level (1) [The first half is truly dominated by Real Madrid. The strengths of the players are clearly showing.] [There's no doubt about it. Woo Ho-young has run 5km so far, showing excellent activity. Cristiano Ronaldo, who has run 4.6km, is also a great help to the team. Above all, the synergy between the two seems better than expected. Xabi Alonso's build-up ability was also good.] Everything was going according to plan. The coordination between the players wasn't perfect, but it was certainly not at a level to be criticized. In fact, considering the short-term rebuilding, it was quite excellent. Especially the combination play starting from Xabi Alonso's passes stood out, and Ho-young's role in turning them into creative plays was also impressive. But it was too early to be surprised. As the first half was drawing to a close, Raul was substituted out and Benzema was brought in. \\"Wow!\\" \\"Benzema is coming on?\\" \\"Karim Benzema!\\" \\"Let's see a debut goal!\\" As Benzema appeared, some of the fans cheered. It was an unbelievable sight that the captain, Raul, was replaced by a new transfer. And for good reason, as some of Real Madrid's fans were completely taken with Benzema's fiery and powerful style. It might have been a natural phenomenon. Just think of Real Madrid's strikers over the past few years. Raul, Ronaldo, Robinho, Higuain, Van Nistelrooy, Antonio Cassano, and so on. Except for Cassano, weren't they all introverted and quiet attackers? Then Benzema, with his rough and direct style, appeared, and like junk food drawing people in, fans were captivated by his charm. 'Yeah, people want me. Real Madrid needs a striker like me.' Benzema, who took to the field as the lone striker, was filled with extraordinary resolve. 'I'm not here to support Woo Ho-young or Ronaldo.' His dream since childhood was to wear the white uniform of Real Madrid. He had even turned down an incredible offer from Manchester United for that reason. He had exceptional ambition and aspirations. 'I will change everything about Real Madrid.' Real Madrid. He wanted to have the Santiago Bernabeu at his feet. The situation was perfect. Real Madrid's hardcore fans were disappointed with Perez, and they were doubly disappointed when Perez left. Moreover, the team was divided during the rebuilding. In the midst of this, Benzema wanted to unite the team and become the hero of Real Madrid. With 'skill,' that is. 'I will definitely succeed.' Benzema looked down at Ho-young standing below and reaffirmed his goal. It was at that moment. A strange tension flowed between the two. And Ho-young's eyes sharpened. [Karim Benzema] Talents: - Artistic Combination Play (S-) - Excellent Positioning (S-) - Piercing Space Penetration (A+3) - Precise First Touch (A+2) - Burning Competitiveness (A+2) - Reckless Boldness (A-) (More) (You can covet one talent if you meet the conditions.) (Grade S and above talents require fulfilling hidden conditions to covet.) (Condition 1: Win the game) (Condition 2: Each record 1 offensive point) (Hidden Condition: Unlocked when coveting at least one talent) Karim Benzema. Although he didn't have any U-grade talents yet, it seemed he could conquer everything from A-grade talents related to ball control to S-grade. 'Is Artistic Combination Play a talent that integrates with movement?' He was certainly a player who could covet many things. The game soon resumed. Thump. [Woo Ho-young receives the goal kick with his chest and passes the ball back to Xabi Alonso.] [Benzema is sprinting forward like an arrow.] The flow had changed. Instead of the veteran savvy seen last season, the field was filled with youthful energy. If the ball was lost to Deportivo, they immediately applied intense pressure to regain possession. This seemed similar to Guardiola's 6-second rule, but it was a tactic newly implemented by Scolari in his own style. While the principle of immediate retrieval upon losing the ball was the same, it also significantly increased the mobility of the midfielders. [The 4-2-3-1 formation's strengths are being utilized, aiming to maximize the efficiency of counterattacks.] [That's right. Real Madrid's forward pressure is quite strong. It's almost like they're emulating Barcelona's tactics.] [It's suffocating. Deportivo's players can hardly get out.] Then the flow of the game changed once again. When the opponent was passing the ball around in defense, trying to waste time, the intensity of the pressure was reduced overall to lure the opponent out. This was Scolari's method against weaker teams. The game was flowing as he predicted. He relaxed the guard, waiting for the opponent to come out, and when the time was right, he cut off the midfield to attempt another counterattack. [A clean tackle by Mahamadou Diarra! The ball rolls out to Xabi Alonso.] Xabi Alonso, having caught the loose ball, looked back. There wasn't enough time to send it forward. The pass was delivered to Mertesacker in the back. Thump! Per Mertesacker. He was a commanding defender of an intelligent type, which didn't match his 2-meter height. Not only that, but he also had a solid foundation in passing and vision, which made him competent in building up from the back. Especially in such situations, he intuitively knew where to send the pass. 'There.' A player entered Mertesacker's view. It was Woo Ho-young, sprinting up from the center towards the second line. Mertesacker made a decision immediately. 'It's possible.' He thought it was entirely possible with Woo Ho-young, whom he had been syncing with for the past month."},{"instruction":"207. 졸업 그리고 본격적인 시작(1) 경기가 끝난 후, 벤제마에게서 ‘정교한 퍼스트 터치(A+3)’를 탐하자 ‘경지에 이른 볼 감각’의 절대치가 소량 상승했다. 더욱이 지네딘 지단의 ‘경이로운 탈 압박(S+)’이라는 귀중한 재능을 가져올 수 있었다. 히든조건이 바로 ‘공식 은퇴식 거행’이었기 때문이다. 늦은 밤. 공식 은퇴식 이후 경기장 지하에서 기자회견이 이어졌다. 지단은 시작도 하기 전에 이미 눈시울을 붉히고 있었다. 아무리 담담한 성격의 소유자라 할지언정 복받쳐 오르는 감정은 쉽게 참아낼 수 없었다. 그런 가운데 한 기자가 물었다. “당신은 분명 미셸 플라티니와 어깨를 견줄 수 있는 프랑스의 대표적 상징이자, 레알 마드리드의 전설이 되었습니다. 그 과정에는 수많은 동료선수들이 있었는데요. 가장 기억에 남는 선수가 있다면 누구일까요?” 은퇴식 하면 빼놓을 수 없는 난처한 질문. 이 질문만 나오면 대부분의 선수들은 두루뭉술하게 대답하고 만다. 하지만 지단은 즉흥적으로 가감 없이 말했다. “기억에 남는 사람은 수도 없이 많습니다. 프랑스에는 비에이라, 마케렐레, 드사이, 앙리 등이 있을 것이고, 레알 마드리드에는 라울, 카를로스, 구티, 호나우두, 카시야스, 살가도 등이 있을 겁니다. 그리고 모두가 알다시피 우호영이 제 황혼기에 있었죠. 그들에게 무한한 감사를 전하고 싶습니다.” “마지막 말씀이 매우 감동적이군요. 그런데 여기서 흥미로운 점이 있습니다. 세간에 알려진 대로, 정말 우호영이 당신의 축구인생에 크고 작은 변화를 주었던 것인가요?” “제가 축구를 시작하게 된 계기는 엔조 프란체스콜리와 미셸 플라티니 때문입니다. 그리고 축구를 다시 시작하게 된 계기는 우호영입니다.” 그는 그 말을 시작으로, 30분이 넘도록 인터뷰를 진행했다. 평소 조용한 성격을 가진 그였지만 오늘만큼은 하고 싶은 말이 많았다. 그리고 인터뷰 직후. 기자회견장을 나온 지단은 흡연실로 들어가 담배를 한 대 피웠다. “이젠 아무데서나 마음대로 필 수 있겠군.” 이제 은퇴한 몸이니 어디에서든 떳떳하게 담배를 필 수 있었다. 사실 그는 담배와 때려야 땔 수 없는 사이였다. 오래 전, 유명한 골초로 알려졌던 그는 항상 기자들의 눈을 피해 담배를 피우곤 했었다. 금연을 시도한 적은 수없이 많았지만 번번이 실패로 돌아가고 말았다. 그나마 가장 오랫동안 금연을 시도했던 게 2006년 독일 월드컵 이후였다. 우호영을 바라보며 재기를 다짐했던 그날부터 약 2년간은 담배에 손도 대지 않았었다. 은퇴를 미루게 된 것 역시 그 때문이었다. 지단은 창밖의 베르나베우 경기장을 바라보며 피식 웃었다. 앞서 인터뷰에서 밝힌 대로, 이곳에서 더 오래 뛸 수 있었던 것은 모두 우호영 덕분이었다. ‘신비로운 녀석이야.’ 그와 함께한 시간은 늘 신비롭고 경이로웠다. 예전엔 놀라운 잠재력으로 사람을 놀라게 만들더니, 요즘엔 입이 떡 벌어지는 실력으로 기쁨을 주고 있었다. 이렇게나 성장한 우호영을 보고 있으면 입가에 미소가 절로 머금어졌다. 직접 1-2년간 가르쳤다보니 뿌듯함이 엄청났다. 과장하나 보태지 않고 친아들보다도 더 열성적으로 가르쳤던 게 바로 호영이었으니까. 그리고. “후······.” 이제는 그 모든 것이 어느새 옛날 일이 되어버렸다. 8년간 몸담았던 이곳 산티아고 베르나베우에서 자신의 흔적이 없어질 거라는 생각에 아쉬움도 들었다. 물론 마드리드를 아예 떠나려는 것은 아니었다. 레알 마드리드에서 코치직을 맡아 감독으로 발전해가고 싶다는 오랜 생각이 있었다. 그러나 문제는 칼데론이었다. 그는, 페레즈와 매우 각별한 사이인 지단을 고용할 리가 없었다. ‘한동안은 마드리드를 떠나있어야겠지.’ 여기 있다가는 칼데론의 정치적 희생양이 될 것이 뻔했다. 이미 얼마 전 페레즈에게서 전화 한 통을 받은 적이 있었다. 하여 훗날을 위해 잠시 마드리드를 떠나있기로 하였다. 치익. 담배를 한 대 태우고 나니 머릿속이 말끔히 정리되었다. 그 다음으로 향한 곳은 라커룸이었다. 구단의 배려로 아직 정리되지 않은 자신의 자리를 치우기 위함이었다. 당연히도 불은 다 꺼져있었다. 선수들은 이미 아까 전에 돌아갔을 테니까. 그런데 바로 그때였다. 타닥, 탁. “뭐지?” 갑자기 불이 켜지더니 바닥에 납작 엎드려있던 선수들이 하나둘씩 일어났다. “이런 맙소사···.” 지단의 입가에 자글자글한 주름이 졌다. 이미 아까 전에 팀 버스를 타고 떠났어야할 선수들이 모두 남아있는 것이 아닌가. 분위기는 한없이 진지했다. 한 명쯤은 웃음보를 터트릴 만도 한데 모두가 진중한 얼굴을 하고 있었다. 평소에 장난기가 많은 마르셀루조차 마찬가지. 이것이 레전드의 마지막을 대하는 선수들의 자세였다. 그리고. “지주, 그 동안 수고 많았다.” 라울이 대표로 나와 지단과 포옹을 나눴다. “녀석들도 참···.” 지단은 다시금 눈시울을 붉히고 말았다. 평소 부끄러움이 많았기에 이런 이벤트에 특히나 약했다. 하지만 거기서 끝이 아니었다. 탁. 다시 불이 꺼지더니 뒤쪽에서 건장한 사내가 불쑥 튀어나왔다. 촛불이 켜진 케이크를 들고 서있는 호영이 지단 앞으로 다가가고 있었다. 얼굴은 편안했다. 누구보다 이 순간이 오지 않기를 바랐던 호영이었지만, 떠나보낼 땐 시원하게 보내줘야 한다고 생각했다. 그래야 미련도 없을 테니까. 그리고 지단은 감독이 되어 반드시 마드리드로 돌아올 거라고 생각했으니까. “수고 많으셨습니다.” “고맙다.” 마지막 순간까지 잊지 못할 선물을 받은 지단은 그 말밖에 할 수 없었다. 그것이 그들의 마지막이었다. 8월 30일. 다음날은 선수단 전원에게 꿀 같은 휴식이 주어졌다. 하지만 호영은 아침부터 외출준비에 여념이 없었다. 머리에 왁스칠을 해서 한쪽으로 넘기고, 옷은 깔끔하게 갖춰 입은 다음, 루치가 대기해놓은 차를 타고 집을 나섰다. 집을 나선 시각은 오전 8시였고, 30분 남짓 걸려서 도착한 곳은 SAK국제학교 엘 카스티요였다. “와, 사람 많네요.” 개학까지 일주일이나 남아있었음에도 학교 앞은 인산인해를 이루고 있었다. 평상시와 다른 점은 학생들이며 학부모며 그 밖의 외부인이며, 대부분이 드레스나 양복차림을 갖춰 입고 있다는 것이었다. “스페인 졸업식은 이런 식이군요. 학생들도 드레스랑 양복을 갖춰 입을 줄은 몰랐는데.” “한국도 저러나요?” “음···. 글쎄요. 제가 한국에서는 중학교를 안 다녀봐서.” “하하. 참, 그러시죠.” 오늘은 SAK국제학교 엘 카스티요의 졸업식이 있는 날이었다. 달리 말해 모니카의 졸업식이었다. “그럼 조심히 갔다 와요. 팬들에게 둘러싸여서 구해달라고 전화하시지 말고. 그게 가장 힘든 일인 거 알죠?” “큭큭. 걱정 말고 볼 일 보고 오세요. 그럼 전 갔다 올게요.” 오늘도 어김없이 선글라스를 낀 호영은 조용히 학교 안으로 들어갔다. 주변에 분명 파파라치들이 따라 붙었겠지만 그것까지 신경 쓸 여유는 없었다. ‘오늘은 머리도 좀 색다르게 만졌으니까 많이는 못 알아보겠지.’ 그리고 입구에 들어선 순간이었다. “어?! WHY?” “이런.” 학교 안으로 들어선지 단 1초 만에 호영을 알아본 한 소년. “우, 우호영 선수 맞죠?” “안녕하세요. 모른 척 좀 부탁드릴게요.” “와······.” 호영이 악수를 건네며 부탁하자, 소년은 당황한 얼굴로 주머니를 뒤져대기 시작했다. “이런 망할.” 그러고는 곧 허탈한 얼굴을 지었다. “펜이 없어요······.” “사인은 다음에 만나면 꼭 해줄게요.” “아아, 잠시 만요. 제발 잠깐만 있어줘요. 팬이에요. 아니, 우상이란 말이에요.","output":"207. Graduation and the Real Start (1) After the game ended, when I coveted 'Precise First Touch (A+3)' from Benzema, the absolute value of 'Masterful Ball Sense' slightly increased. Moreover, I was able to acquire the precious talent 'Wonderful Dribbling (S+)' from Zinedine Zidane. The hidden condition was the 'Official Retirement Ceremony.' Late at night. After the official retirement ceremony, a press conference continued in the stadium's basement. Zidane was already teary-eyed before it even began. No matter how composed he was, the overwhelming emotions were not easy to suppress. Amidst this, a journalist asked a question. \\"You have certainly become a symbolic figure of France, comparable to Michel Platini, and a legend of Real Madrid. There have been many teammates along the way. Is there any player that stands out in your memory?\\" A tricky question that is inevitable at a retirement ceremony. Most players tend to give vague answers to this question. However, Zidane spoke candidly and spontaneously. \\"There are countless people I remember. In France, there were Vieira, Makelele, Desailly, Henry, and at Real Madrid, there were Raul, Carlos, Guti, Ronaldo, Casillas, Salgado, and as everyone knows, Woo Ho-young was there during my twilight years. I want to express my infinite gratitude to them.\\" \\"Your last words are very touching. But there's something interesting here. As is known to the public, did Woo Ho-young really bring significant changes to your football life?\\" \\"The reason I started playing football was because of Enzo Francescoli and Michel Platini. And the reason I started playing football again was Woo Ho-young.\\" With those words, he went on to give an interview for over 30 minutes. Although he was usually a quiet person, today he had a lot to say. And right after the interview. Zidane, who had left the press conference room, entered the smoking room and lit a cigarette. \\"Now I can smoke freely anywhere.\\" Now that he was retired, he could smoke openly anywhere. In fact, he had an inseparable relationship with cigarettes. Once known as a heavy smoker, he always smoked away from the eyes of journalists. He had tried to quit smoking countless times, but each attempt ended in failure. The longest he had managed to quit was after the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He hadn't touched a cigarette for about two years since the day he resolved to make a comeback while watching Woo Ho-young. That was also why he had postponed his retirement. Zidane smiled wryly as he looked out at the Bernabeu Stadium from the window. As he had revealed in the interview, the reason he could play longer here was all thanks to Woo Ho-young. 'A mysterious guy.' The time spent with him was always mystical and wondrous. In the past, he amazed people with his incredible potential, and nowadays, he was giving joy with his jaw-dropping skills. Seeing Woo Ho-young grow so much always brought a smile to his face. He felt immense pride, having taught him directly for 1-2 years. Without exaggeration, he had taught Ho-young more passionately than his own son. And then. \\"Sigh...\\" Now all of that had become a thing of the past. He felt a sense of loss thinking that his traces would disappear from the Santiago Bernabeu, where he had spent eight years. Of course, he wasn't planning to leave Madrid altogether. He had long thought of taking a coaching position at Real Madrid and progressing to become a manager. However, the problem was Calderon. He was unlikely to hire Zidane, who was very close to Perez. 'I'll have to leave Madrid for a while.' Staying here would make him a political sacrifice for Calderon. He had already received a call from Perez a while ago. So he decided to leave Madrid for the future. Click. After smoking a cigarette, his mind felt clear. The next place he headed to was the locker room. Thanks to the club's consideration, he went to clear out his still-untouched spot. Naturally, the lights were all off. The players had already left earlier. But just then. Click, clack. \\"What's this?\\" Suddenly the lights turned on, and players who had been lying flat on the floor began to get up one by one. \\"Oh my goodness...\\" Wrinkles formed around Zidane's mouth. The players who should have left on the team bus earlier were all still there. The atmosphere was incredibly serious. Even though one might expect someone to burst into laughter, everyone had a solemn expression. Even Marcelo, who was usually playful, was no exception. This was how the players behaved in the presence of a legend. And then. \\"Zizou, you've worked hard.\\" Raul, representing the team, came forward and embraced Zidane. \\"You guys too...\\" Zidane's eyes welled up with tears again. Being a shy person, he was particularly weak to such events. But it didn't end there. Click. The lights went out again, and a robust man suddenly popped out from the back. Ho-young, holding a cake with lit candles, approached Zidane. His face was relaxed. Although Ho-young had hoped this moment would never come, he believed that when it was time to say goodbye, it should be done wholeheartedly. That way, there would be no regrets. And he believed that Zidane would definitely return to Madrid as a manager. \\"Thank you for everything.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Receiving an unforgettable gift until the last moment, Zidane could only say those words. That was their last moment together. August 30th. The next day, the entire squad was given a sweet day of rest. But Ho-young was busy preparing to go out from the morning. After styling his hair with wax and dressing neatly, he got into the car that Lucia had prepared and left the house. He left the house at 8 a.m., and after about 30 minutes, he arrived at SAK International School El Castillo. \\"Wow, there are so many people.\\" Even though there was still a week left until the start of school, the front of the school was crowded with people. The difference from usual was that students, parents, and outsiders were all dressed in dresses and suits. \\"I didn't know Spanish graduation ceremonies were like this. I didn't expect the students to be dressed up in dresses and suits.\\" \\"Is it like this in Korea too?\\" \\"Um... I'm not sure. I didn't attend middle school in Korea.\\" \\"Ha ha. Right, of course.\\" Today was the graduation ceremony at SAK International School El Castillo. In other words, it was Monica's graduation ceremony. \\"Then take care. Don't call me surrounded by fans asking to be rescued. You know that's the hardest part, right?\\" \\"Chuckle. Don't worry, go and do what you need to. I'll be back soon.\\" As always, Ho-young, wearing sunglasses, quietly entered the school. There were certainly paparazzi following him, but he couldn't afford to pay attention to that. 'I styled my hair a bit differently today, so they probably won't recognize me much.' And the moment he entered the gate. \\"Whoa?! WHY?\\" \\"Oh no.\\" Just 1 second after entering the school, a boy recognized Ho-young. \\"Are you... Woo Ho-young?\\" \\"Hello. I'd appreciate it if you could pretend you don't know me.\\" \\"Wow...\\" As Ho-young extended his hand for a handshake and made the request, the boy started rummaging through his pockets in a fluster. \\"Damn it.\\" Then he soon made a defeated face. \\"I don't have a pen...\\" \\"I'll definitely give you an autograph next time we meet.\\" \\"Ah, wait a moment, please. Just stay for a second. I'm a fan. No, you're my idol.\\""},{"instruction":"209. 전초전(1) “이렇게 셋이 특별훈련이라면, 4-2-3-1 포메이션을 활용한다는 말씀이군요.” “그렇다면 제가 왼쪽에서 인사이드 포워드의 역할을 맡았으면 좋겠습니다.” 우호영과 호날두가 차례대로 말했다. 한참이나 경력과 실력이 부족한 더글라스는 잠자코 들었다. 이어 스콜라리가 입을 열었다. “너희들의 역할분담에 관한 내용은 추후에 설명하도록 하고, 지금은 오늘부터 당장 하게 될 훈련을 간략히 설명해주도록 하지.” “연계훈련을 말씀하시는 건가요?” “그것보다 앞서 진행하게 될 훈련이 있다. 바로 ‘추격자 훈련’이지.” 사실 공격훈련은 수비훈련에 비해 매우 단조롭다. 아주 특별한 훈련을 하더라도, 막상 실전에 들어가면 큰 성과를 거두지 못하는 게 일반적이기 때문이다. 그래서 공격수들은 기본적으로 드리블 및 슈팅훈련을 하고, 심화적으로 탈압박과 세트피스 훈련을 받는다. 한 마디로 경기감각을 유지하기 위한 기본훈련이라고 할 수 있다. 여기서 더 추가해봐야 선수별로 묶어서 연계 및 포지셔닝 훈련을 하거나, 상대의 수비조직력이 매우 탄탄한 팀이라면 상황별 맞춤훈련까지 추가된다. 여기까지만 해도 훈련에 소요되는 시간이 상당하다. 그럼에도 다른 훈련을 더 추가하겠다는 것은, 스콜라리에게 확신이 있다는 뜻이었다. ‘추격자 훈련이라.’ 호영으로서는 들어본 적 없는 생소한 훈련이었다. 축구를 시작한지 어느덧 8년째였지만 단 한 번도 해본 적이 없었다. 명성깨나 떨치는 감독들은 저마다 자신만의 훈련법을 가지고 있다는데, 아무래도 이게 그것인 모양이었다. ‘우리 3명이서 서로를 쫓으면서 큰 삼각편대를 그리는 전술인가?’ 슈스터의 재능을 탐해 전술이해도를 S급으로 상승시킨 호영이었다. 축구전술에 대한 이해도가 전보다 깊어진 덕분에 생각의 폭도 넓어진 것 같았다. 그리고 때마침, 스콜라리가 가려운 곳을 벅벅 긁어주었다. “작년 바르셀로나의 압박과 탈압박은 매우 훌륭했다. 이에 베른트 슈스터는 도망자나 방관자와 같은 축구를 구사하며 그들을 역으로 찍어 눌렀지. 그게 아마 우호영 자네의 생각이었던 것 같은데.” “예. 제가 의견을 제시했었죠.” “그래, 그건 기가 막힌 맞춤전술이었어. 하지만 그들은 작년보다 더욱 견고해지고 촘촘해졌다. 리오넬 메시의 인터뷰대로, 작년의 패배를 극복하기 위해 단점을 극복했을 거야. 내가 보기에 과르디올라는 무조건 그랬을 거다.” 셋은 모두 고개를 끄덕였다. 세상 어느 축구인이 보아도 그건 맞는 말이었다. “따라서 이번에 우리는, 도망자나 방관자처럼 축구를 하지 않을 거다. 하더라도 상대의 전술변화에 맞춰서 사용하겠지.” “그럼 메인 전술은 뭔가요?” “기존의 틀을 따라 간다. 다만 압박으로 인해 포화된 구역을 빨리 벗어나고, 공간을 열어 복합적이고 유기적인 움직임을 갖추는 훈련을 병행할 것이다. 그게 바로 ‘추격자 훈련’이지.” 이른바 압박과 탈압박을 동시에 단련할 수 있는 훈련법. 훈련은 말이 끝나기 무섭게 시작되었다. 앞으로 2주간 진행될 예정이었다. 엘 클라시코를 앞두고 팀에 변화가 생겼다. 지난 시즌 카스티야에서 좋은 모습을 보였던 페드로 모스케라(Pedro Mosquera)가 1군으로 올라왔고, 기존의 선수들은 마르코스 알론소와 더글라스 코스타랑 호흡을 맞추는데 시간과 노력을 기울였다. 주급 문제는 팀의 사기를 위해 잠시 묻어두었다. 2주 뒤 있을 엘 클라시코에 핵심멤버가 셋이나 빠지게 되었으니, 조금이라도 선수들의 기세를 끌어올려야 했기 때문이다. 그리고 희소식이 하나 있었다. “우리만큼 바르셀로나에도 부상자가 많다. 짐작컨대 앙리와 부스케츠 그리고 아비달의 출전이 불투명한 상황이지. 그러니 겁부터 먹을 필요 전혀 없어. 축구는 기세가 반이야.” 스콜라리는 그쯤에서 오전 브리핑을 마친 뒤, 오후부터는 엘 클라시코를 위한 훈련에 나섰다. 물론 다음 주에 라싱 산탄데르전이 예정돼있었지만, 상대가 상대이다 보니 크게 신경 쓸 필요는 없었다. 오히려 엘 클라시코에 대비한 전초전쯤으로 생각하고 있었다. 스콜라리는 거기서 모험적인 전술을 시도할 계획이었다. 한편 추격자 훈련도 차질 없이 진행되고 있었다. 첫 4일간은 호날두-우호영-더글라스가 한 조를 이뤘고, 그 다음 3일은 라울-벤제마-이과인이 차례대로 훈련에 참가하여 총 4명이서 호흡을 맞추었다. 위의 셋보다 기동력이 부족한 반 니스텔루이는 아예 선발명단에서 제외되었다. 그리고 여기서 훈련조장을 맡은 호영은 틈틈이 선수들에게 노하우를 전수하며 그들의 자신감을 끌어올렸다. 2선을 맡아야하는 셋 중에서 엘 클라시코를 경험한 선수는 호영이 유일했기 때문이다. 사실 호날두로서는 자존심이 상할 법도 했지만 별 다른 트러블 없이 훈련에 집중하였다. 그도 그럴 게 그는 개막이래 15경기에 출전하여 16골을 기록했는데, 그중 호영의 어시스트가 7개씩이나 되다보니 악감정을 가지려야 가질 수 없었다. 그리고 무엇보다 독선적이지 않은 호영의 성격이 마음에 들었다. 팀원들의 의견을 최대한 반영하여 훈련을 이끌어나가는 모습이 매우 인상 깊었다. 맨유의 마이클 캐릭과 박지석의 모범생 같은 이미지가 보이면서도, 웨인 루니와 같은 대담한 모습도 엿보였다. 하지만 가장 대단하다고 느낀 것은 따로 있었다. “크리스 씨. 실전에서도 이런 식으로 스위칭을 하는 게 어떨까요?” “하지만 이 훈련법을 실전에서 사용하기엔 무리가 있을 텐데? 이건 그저 압박과 탈압박을 단련하기 위한 훈련일 뿐이야. 이걸 전술로 사용한다는 건 이상에 가까워.” “맞아요. 하지만 계속 생각해보면 분명 방법이 있을 거예요. 그렇게 해서 과르디올라의 티키타카가 세상 밖으로 나왔잖아요. 우리라고 못할 건 없죠.” 방법을 찾으려고 하는 진지한 태도와 투지. 그리고 천재성. 축구를 정말 즐기고 있다는 것이 느껴졌다. ‘나만큼이나 축구를 열정적으로 좋아하는 녀석은 간만이군.’ 낯설지 않은 기분이었다. 마치 알렉스 퍼거슨 감독을 보는 것 같은 느낌마저 들었다. 인생전부를 걸고 매순간 승부를 펼치는 그는 자타공인 축구에 미친 사람이었다. 헌데 호영을 보고 있으면, 퍼거슨의 어린 시절이 저러지 않았을까하는 생각이 들었다. “그래. 현실에 맞지 않는 부분은 우리가 메우면 되는 거다.” “예.” 호영과 호날두. 둘은 신뢰의 눈빛을 주고받았다.","output":"209. The Preliminary Battle (1) \\"If the three of us are doing special training, it means we'll be utilizing the 4-2-3-1 formation,\\" said Woo Ho-young. \\"Then I'd like to take on the role of the inside forward on the left,\\" Cristiano Ronaldo added one after the other. Douglas, who was significantly less experienced and skilled, listened quietly. Then Scolari began to speak. \\"Let's put aside the discussion of your role distribution for now, and let me briefly explain the training that will start today.\\" \\"Are you talking about combination training?\\" \\"Before that, there's another training that we'll be doing. It's called 'Chaser Training.'\\" In fact, offensive training is very monotonous compared to defensive training. Even if you do something very special, it often doesn't yield significant results in actual games. Therefore, forwards typically do dribbling and shooting training, and more advanced players work on evading pressure and set-piece training. In short, it's basic training to maintain game sense. At most, players are grouped together for combination and positioning training, or if the opponent has a very solid defensive organization, situational custom training is added. Even this takes a considerable amount of time for training. So, adding another training meant that Scolari was confident. 'Chaser Training.' It was a new type of training that Ho-young had never heard of. Although he had been playing soccer for nearly 8 years, he had never done it once. Renowned coaches each have their own training methods, and this seemed to be one of them. 'Are the three of us going to chase each other and form a large triangle formation tactically?' Having coveted Schuster's talent and raised his tactical understanding to S-grade, Ho-young felt his understanding of soccer tactics had deepened, and his thoughts had broadened. Just then, Scolari scratched the itch. \\"Last year, Barcelona's pressing and evading pressure were excellent. In response, Bernd Schuster played soccer like a fugitive or a bystander, pressing them down in return. I think that's what you were thinking, Woo Ho-young.\\" \\"Yes, I had suggested that idea.\\" \\"Right, it was a brilliant custom tactic. But they have become even more solid and dense than last year. As Lionel Messi said in an interview, they overcame last year's defeat by overcoming their weaknesses. In my view, Guardiola would have definitely done that.\\" All three nodded in agreement. It was a statement that any soccer person in the world would agree with. \\"Therefore, this time, we will not play soccer like fugitives or bystanders. Even if we do, it will be in response to the opponent's tactical changes.\\" \\"So what's the main tactic?\\" \\"We'll follow the existing framework. However, we'll combine training to quickly escape from areas saturated with pressure and to create complex and organic movements. That's 'Chaser Training.'\\" A training method that simultaneously trains both pressing and evading pressure. Training started as soon as the explanation ended. It was scheduled to continue for the next two weeks. There was a change in the team ahead of El Clasico. Pedro Mosquera, who had shown good form in Castilla last season, was promoted to the first team, and the existing players spent time and effort syncing with Marcos Alonso and Douglas Costa. The issue of weekly wages was temporarily set aside for the sake of team morale. With three key members missing for El Clasico in two weeks, it was necessary to boost the players' spirits even a little. And there was some good news. \\"Barcelona has as many injured players as we do. I guess Henry, Busquets, and Abidal's participation is uncertain. So there's no need to be scared right off the bat. Soccer is half about momentum.\\" Scolari ended the morning briefing there and started training for El Clasico in the afternoon. Of course, there was a match against Racing Santander scheduled for the next week, but since the opponent was who they were, there was no need to worry too much. Instead, he considered it a preliminary battle in preparation for El Clasico. Scolari planned to try an adventurous tactic there. Meanwhile, Chaser Training was also proceeding without a hitch. For the first four days, Ronaldo, Woo Ho-young, and Douglas formed a group, and for the next three days, Raul, Benzema, and Higuain took turns participating in the training, with a total of four players syncing up. Ruud van Nistelrooy, who lacked the mobility of the aforementioned trio, was excluded from the starting lineup. And Ho-young, who was in charge of the training group, took the opportunity to pass on his know-how to the players and boost their confidence. Among the three who had to play in the second line, Ho-young was the only one with experience in El Clasico. In fact, Ronaldo could have taken it as a blow to his pride, but he focused on the training without any trouble. After all, since the opening of the season, he had played in 15 games and scored 16 goals, with 7 assists from Ho-young, so it was hard to hold any bad feelings. And above all, he liked Ho-young's unselfish character. Ho-young led the training by incorporating the team members' opinions as much as possible, which left a deep impression. He had the exemplary image of Manchester United's Michael Carrick and Park Ji-sung, yet also showed the boldness of Wayne Rooney. But what impressed him the most was something else. \\"Chris, what do you think about using this kind of switching in actual games?\\" \\"But wouldn't it be too difficult to use this training method in real games? It's just training to practice pressing and evading pressure. Using it as a tactic is almost like a fantasy.\\" \\"Right. But if we keep thinking about it, there must be a way. That's how Guardiola's Tiki-Taka came out into the world. There's no reason we can't do it.\\" The serious attitude and determination to find a way. And the genius. It was clear that he truly enjoyed playing soccer. 'It's been a while since I've seen someone who loves soccer as passionately as I do.' It was a familiar feeling. It even felt like looking at a young Alex Ferguson. Ferguson, who gambled his entire life on every moment of the game, was known as a man obsessed with soccer. Looking at Ho-young, he wondered if Ferguson's youth might not have been similar. \\"Right. We'll fill in the parts that don't fit reality.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Ho-young and Ronaldo.

[에릭 아비달이 공을 받습니다. 전방을 바라보지만··· 여의치 않군요. 결국 뒤쪽의 발데스에게 공을 돌립니다.] [우호영이 우측에 적극적으로 가담하면서 공격활로를 차단하고 있어요. 덕분에 더글라스가 한결 여유를 되찾은 모습입니다.] [아무래도 상파울루FC 유소년 팀에서 한솥밥을 먹어서 그런지 잘 맞는 점이 보입니다. 보기 좋은 동료애에요.] 둘의 합동수비가 바르셀로나의 좌측측면을 마비시키고 있었다. 그 탓에 좌측 윙포워드에 배치된 페드로(Pedro)까지 발이 묶이면서 이렇다 할 움직임을 보여주지 못했다. 하지만 득이 있으면 그만큼 실이 있는 법. [중앙의 압박이 느슨해지면서 케이타도 확실히 여유를 되찾았네요. 바르셀로나의 수비진이 중앙으로 패스를 모아줍니다.] 계속 기회를 내주기만 했던 바르셀로나는 공격활로를 바꾸었다. 좌측은 쳐다도 보지 않고 중앙과 우측을 집중적으로 공략했다. 레알 마드리드의 위기는 거기서 비롯되었다. 오늘 특별히 좌측풀백으로 기용된 아르벨로아(Arbeloa)가 호날두와 합심해 좌측측면을 막아섰지만 한계가 분명했다. 메시와 알베스의 연계플레이가 그제야 제 실력을 발휘하기 시작한 것이었다. “알베스의 길목부터 차단해. 메시의 중앙 침투는 뒤에서 막아야 돼.” 수비의 사령관 페어 메르테사커의 목소리가 좌측으로 전해졌다. 하지만 그것만으로는 역부족이었다. 메시를 상대하는 방법은 알지만, 막을 수 있는 능력은 없었으니까. 탁! [알베스의 공이 우여곡절 끝에 메시에게 전달됩니다.] [리오넬 메시, 툭툭 치고 나가는데요.] [호날두가 메시의 뒤를 노립니다!] [하지만 그대로 뚫고 전진하는 리오넬 메시!] 군더더기 없이 간결한 드리블. 호날두를 젖힌 메시가 방향을 접으면서 아르벨로아까지 따돌리자 상황이 급격하게 전개되었다. [리오넬 메시가 사비에게 주고 박스 안쪽으로 들어갑니다!] 급박한 상황. 즐라탄이 중앙에서 위치를 잡고 수비수들의 시선을 끌어모으는 사이, 메시가 박스 안쪽으로 파고들어 공간을 창출했다. 바로 그때, 기회를 엿보던 페드로와 이니에스타가 안쪽으로 파고들었다. 순식간에 공격 숫자가 네 명으로 늘어난 순간이었다. 사비의 눈이 번뜩인 것도 바로 그때였다. [이니에스타의 발 아래로 정확히 떨어지는 킬 패스!] 찰나 슈팅 각도가 살짝 열렸지만 이니에스타는 슈팅 대신 패스를 선택했다. 바로 옆쪽에 노마크 찬스로 달려오고 있던 페드로였다. [페드로에게 툭 밀어찬 공!] [그대로 슈우우우웃!] 퍼억! [카시야스의 선방! 동물 같은 반응속도입니다!] 매서운 공격이 한 차례 지나갔지만 숨 돌릴 틈은 없었다. 카시야스의 펀칭에 맡고 흘러나온 볼이 즐라탄의 발치 앞으로 떨어진 것이었다. 슈팅이 터져 나오기 일보직전. 10만여 관중들의 숨이 일제히 멎은 듯 분위기가 싹 가라앉았다. 하지만. 타악! [페페의 환상적인 슬라이딩 태클!] 페페가 몸을 던지면서 절호의 슈팅찬스를 무마시켰다. 하지만 여전히 안심할 수 없는 상황. 위기에서 벗어나려면 아직 한 걸음 남아 있었다. 그리고 바로 그때였다. 툭. [페르난도 가고가 우여곡절 끝에 공을 가져옵니다!] [이니에스타와 메시가 달려드는데요!] 퍼억! 격렬한 압박에 몸싸움이 일어났지만, 가고는 간발의 차이로 넘어지면서 공을 걷어내는 데 성공하였다. 그 공을 받은 이는 중원에 서있는 사비 알론소였다. 위기에서 기회로 넘어가는 순간이었다. [상황이 흥미진진하게 흘러갑니다. 한시라도 눈을 뗄 수 없어요!] [하지만 전방은 여의치 않습니다. 어떻게 될지 1초 앞도 예측 불가입니다.] 정말이었다. 그 순간 누구도 예측하지 못한 일이 벌어졌다. ‘지금이다.’ 바르셀로나의 압박이 상당히 거셌지만 우호영이 중원에 가담하면서, 사비 알론소의 볼 배급이 원활해졌다. [사비 알론소, 압박으로부터 벗어나면서 좌측 측면으로 공을 띄어줍니다.] [호날두가 공중으로 뛰어오릅니다!] 퍼억! “큭!” 알베스가 볼 경합을 시도해봤지만, 호날두의 점프력은 상상 이상이었다. 제공권을 장악한 이는 호날두였다. [호날두의 헤딩이 다시 중앙의 우호영에게 전달됩니다.] [동시에 케이타와 이니에스타가 득달 같이 달려듭니다!] 공을 잡기 무섭게 거친 압박이 들어왔다. 레알 마드리드에게 결코 역습을 허용해주지 않으려는 움직임이었다. 허나 호영의 탈압박 능력과 발재간이 이뤄낸 조화는 그 모든 것을 무용지물로 만들었다. ‘뒤.’ 스윽. “······!” 순간적으로 공을 뒤로 빼내면서 케이타의 헛발질을 유도했다. 연달아 이니에스타가 가담했지만 공은 이미 호영의 발끝을 떠난 뒤였다. [후방으로 흘려주는 패스.","output":"211. Turning the Ideal into Reality (1) Barcelona was building up their play methodically, staying true to their style and aiming for a goal. However, the real opportunities were in the hands of Real Madrid. This was due to Xabi Alonso's decisive killer passes and the sharp off-the-ball movements of Ronaldo and Woo Ho-young. Although Victor Valdes's incredible saves prevented these opportunities from turning into goals, the flow of the game was tilting unfavorably for Barcelona. 'Such a pity.' Xavi Hernandez swallowed the bitter taste. The game, which he thought was manageable, was far from easy. As much as Barcelona had improved, Real Madrid had also become stronger than last season. More precisely, Woo Ho-young's skills had grown by another level. For Xavi, a football genius in his own right, this was hard to accept. Of course, this feeling wasn't new to him. He had felt this same sense of wonder when he first saw Messi. If he had to choose the most memorable moment in his football career, it was then. Messi's potential was something that couldn't be found anywhere else. But now. 'What is this...' He was experiencing a level that surpassed it. As much as he felt sorry for his teammate Messi, it was the truth, and there was nothing he could do about it. Looking at the trajectory so far, in terms of potential, Woo Ho-young was far ahead. No, that didn't mean Messi's skills were superior either. While Messi had his strengths, Woo Ho-young had many more. 'He's versatile and nearly perfect in his skills.' Zidane's successor? No, it was more appropriate to call him Alfredo Di Stefano's successor. 'Terrifying.' He had felt it since last year, but facing him was like gambling. There was no way to handle him with a stable approach. No matter what play unfolded, it required the utmost predictive power and judgment to devise the best move. That was Xavi's way of facing Woo Ho-young. 'I always have to keep an eye on the situation. Who knows what kind of move he's hiding.' With a broad view of the situation, Xavi shouted to the backline. \\"Abidal! Open up the left space more! Woo Ho-young's movement is leaning that way!\\" The complexion of the game changed from there. It was the 21st minute of the first half. [Eric Abidal receives the ball. He looks forward but... it's not promising. Eventually, he passes the ball back to Valdes.] [Woo Ho-young is actively joining the right side, cutting off the attacking route. Thanks to him, Douglas has regained some composure.] [It seems they get along well since they both ate from the same pot at São Paulo FC's youth team. It's a nice display of camaraderie.] Their combined defense paralyzed Barcelona's left flank. As a result, Pedro, positioned as the left winger, was also tied down and couldn't make any significant moves. But where there's gain, there's loss. [The pressure in the center has loosened, and Keita has definitely regained some composure. Barcelona's defense is gathering passes in the center.] Barcelona, which had only been giving away chances, changed their attacking route. They ignored the left side and focused on attacking the center and right side. Real Madrid's crisis originated from there. Arbeloa, who was specially used as the left fullback today, joined forces with Ronaldo to block the left flank, but there were clear limits. Messi and Alves's combination play finally began to show its true strength. \\"Cut off Alves's path first. Messi's central penetration has to be blocked from behind.\\" The voice of the defensive commander, Per Mertesacker, reached the left side. But that alone was not enough. They knew how to face Messi, but they lacked the ability to stop him. Thump! [Alves's ball, after some struggle, reaches Messi.] [Lionel Messi taps it forward.] [Ronaldo is targeting Messi from behind!] [But Messi breaks through and advances!] A clean and concise dribble. As Messi pushed Ronaldo aside and dodged Arbeloa, the situation rapidly unfolded. [Lionel Messi passes to Xavi and enters inside the box!] A critical moment. While Zlatan positioned himself in the center to draw the defenders' attention, Messi created space by diving inside the box. Right then, Pedro and Iniesta, who had been waiting for the opportunity, penetrated inside. In an instant, the number of attackers increased to four. It was then that Xavi's eyes sparkled. [A killer pass falls right at Iniesta's feet!] In a split second, a shooting angle opened up, but Iniesta chose to pass instead of shooting. Pedro was running unmarked on the side. [Pedro pushes the ball forward!] [And he shoooots!] Thump! [Casillas's save! Animal-like reflexes!] The fierce attack passed, but there was no time to catch a breath. The ball punched by Casillas fell right in front of Zlatan's feet. Just before the shot was fired. The atmosphere among the 100,000 spectators seemed to freeze as everyone held their breath. But then. Thwack! [Pepe's fantastic sliding tackle!] Pepe threw himself into the play, thwarting a perfect shooting chance. Still, the situation was not safe. One more step was needed to escape the crisis. And it was at that moment. Thump. [Fernando Gago finally gets hold of the ball after some struggle!] [Iniesta and Messi are charging at him!] Thump! Despite the fierce pressure and physical struggle, Gago managed to clear the ball while falling, just in time. The one who received the ball was Xabi Alonso, standing in the midfield. It was the moment when the situation turned from crisis to opportunity. [The game is flowing thrillingly. You can't take your eyes off for a second!] [But the front is not promising. It's unpredictable what will happen even a second ahead.] Indeed. At that moment, something no one could have predicted happened. 'Now's the time.' Barcelona's pressure was intense, but with Woo Ho-young joining the midfield, Xabi Alonso's ball distribution became smooth. [Xabi Alonso escapes the pressure and sends the ball to the left flank.] [Ronaldo leaps into the air for the ball!] Thump! \\"Ugh!\\" Alves tried to compete for the ball, but Ronaldo's jumping power was beyond imagination. Ronaldo seized control of the ball. [Ronaldo's header is passed back to Woo Ho-young in the center.] [At the same time, Keita and Iniesta rush in!] As soon as he got the ball, a rough pressure came in. Real Madrid was determined not to allow a counterattack. However, the harmony achieved by Ho-young's ability to evade pressure and his footwork rendered all that useless. 'Behind.' Swoosh. \\"...\\" In an instant, he flicked the ball backward, inducing Keita's misstep. Iniesta joined in, but the ball had already left Ho-young's feet. [He passes the ball backward."},{"instruction":"[후방으로 흘려주는 패스. 사비 알론소가 받으면서 공을 안정적으로 지켜냅니다.] [호날두는 공중에서, 호영은 발밑에서 압박을 벗겨내는군요. 바르셀로나의 선수들이 도통 정신을 못 차리고 있습니다.]","output":"[He passes the ball backward.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her twin bump, as she demonstrated during recess - where, when her shirt was lifted up, her bump was visible and the movements of each twin were noticeable; whereas, when covering her stomach region, it showed a perfectly flat belly.)","output":"The floating island, a symbol of unity in a world once torn asunder by war, bustles with the vibrant energy of diverse races and cultures mingling. The shared school, known as Harmony's Keep, stands as an educational beacon where the youth of both factions learn not only academics but also the indispensable lessons of tolerance and friendship. Sayori, the Forsaken girl, had a peculiar grace about her, moving with an elegance that seemed to defy her undead origins. As the lunch bell rang and the students poured into the grounds, she joined her eclectic group of friends under the majestic canopy of an ancient, enchanted tree. \\"Hey, Sayori! Watch this!\\" Gervivien beckoned her with a giggle, the mischief in her eyes twinkling. Nitazar, his blue scales shimmering in the sunlight, playfully rolled his eyes. \\"Are you going to show off your shirt again, Gervi?\\" Gervivien nodded, her slender fingers lifting the hem of her Invisi-paral Night Purple shirt to reveal her twin bumps. The soft pads from within kicked and turned, causing her to let out a gentle laugh. \\"Can't help it! It's too fascinating!\\" Pakinaki, her tall Zandalari form towering over the others, leaned in curiously, her tusks catching the sunlight. \\"Can they sense each other, you think?\\" Sayori's pale, stitched hand reached out shyly to feel the motion beneath the fabric, a small smile crossing her lips. \\"It's like they're dancing,\\" she observed. \\"I wonder if they'll remember these moments when they're born, like a dream?\\" As Gervivien covered her belly with the shirt, the bump vanished, replaced by the illusion of a flat stomach. \\"Well, the shirt is a wonder of goblin engineering; it tricks the eye and offers some comfort. Keeps the stares away, anyway.\\" Nitazar stretched his leathery wings, inclining his horned head. \\"Ah, goblins will make a gadget for pretty much anything,\\" he quipped, earning a round of knowing laughter from the group. Sayori's crimson eyes glanced around at her friends, and she sighed softly with contentment. \\"It's pretty amazing, isn't it? How we all can sit here together... Horde and Alliance... a dracthyr, a troll, a nightborne, and a Forsaken.\\" Pakinaki nodded, her vibrant eyes sparkling with wisdom beyond her years. \\"It be the hope of Azeroth, this. Peace like the calm seas—mighty forces once crashed but now lay still and let life flourish.\\" Gervivien gently smoothed down her shirt, her gaze warm with camaraderie. \\"I'm sure our children will not even remember what 'Horde' and 'Alliance' fighting meant,\\" she reflected, the optimism clear in her voice. Nitazar looked up at the sky, his voice solemn. \\"Yes, the battles are now just echoes, tales for the history books. We forge a new legacy—a legacy of unity.\\" As the bell rang, signaling the end of recess, Sayori and her friends stood up, ready to return to their classes. Their laughter and conversations blended with those of hundreds of other young voices from all corners of Azeroth, a melodic testament to the enduring peace they all cherished and hoped to preserve for generations to come."},{"instruction":"// Decompiled by AS3 Sorcerer 6.78 // www.buraks.com/as3sorcerer //GameLoader package { import flash.display.Sprite;

These ideals are deeply ingrained in modern political systems and have shaped the formation of democratic institutions and policies around the world. Lastly, the Enlightenment critiqued traditional religious and political authority, leading to increased secularization and the separation of church and state. This separation has allowed for more religious freedom and pluralism, fostering a diverse and tolerant society. The Industrial Revolution, on the other hand, had a monumental impact on the world in various ways. Firstly, the invention of machines, such as the steam engine and spinning jenny, revolutionized production processes, leading to the mass production of goods and the rise of factories. This transformed the economic landscape, creating new job opportunities and stimulating economic growth. Moreover, the Industrial Revolution resulted in urbanization, as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of employment. This led to the development of urban infrastructure, improved transportation networks, and the growth of cities as centers of industry, trade, and culture. However, it also brought about numerous social challenges, such as poor working conditions, income inequality, and social unrest, which led to the emergence of labor movements and the eventual creation of labor rights and protections that are still relevant today. Lastly, the Industrial Revolution also spurred advancements in technology, such as the development of electricity, transport systems, and communication networks, which have transformed every aspect of our lives, from transportation and communication to healthcare and entertainment. In conclusion, the Enlightenment revolution and the Industrial Revolution have had a profound and lasting impact on the world today. The Enlightenment revolution laid the foundation for modern democratic societies, scientific advancements, and increased individual freedoms, while the Industrial Revolution transformed the economic landscape, created urbanized societies, and spurred technological progress. These revolutions have shaped our modern world, influencing political systems, scientific discoveries, technological innovations, and societal norms. The consequences of these revolutions can still be seen today, as they have shaped the way we live, work, and interact."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Hindi Comedy-Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. GUPTA HOUSE – DAY The Gupta household sits in the bustling suburbs of Mumbai, a charming two-story home painted with the warm colors of laughter and drama that frequents the lives of the Guptas: Anuradha (50s), the matriarch who maintains a strict but loving rule; her husband Ramesh (late 50s), a businessman with a childlike sense of humor; and their daughter, Nimmi (20), a bright college student with an endearing mix of intelligence and scattered wits, particularly distinguished by her large spectacles and her penchant for loose-fitting kurtis paired with leggings. EXT. GUPTA HOUSE – DAY Nimmi, bushed after a long day in college, power-walks towards the door unsteadily. She's in a plain green kurti, with black leggings. Her desperation is palpable as her hand dives into her bag, searching frantically. NIMMI (under breath) Arrey baba, please let it be here... Arriving at the door, the search turns frantic, until she's sure - no key. Panic strikes; she starts knocking, each thump louder and more urgent than the last. INT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Anuradha, having been napping on the couch, is jolted awake, looking perplexed. Her hair is disheveled, her housecoat slightly askew. She sluggishly makes her way towards the cacophony at the door. ANURADHA (voice groggy) Kaun hai? What's happening? (Who is it?) Nimmi's knocks crescendo. NIMMI (exasperated) Mummy, main hoon, please jaldi karo! (Mom, it's me, please hurry up!) ANURADHA Pehle toh key use kar lete hain... (Usually you use your key...) Anuradha slowly works the lock, oblivious to Nimmi's plight. EXT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Nimmi's face is a study in restraint; she’s bobbing on her heels in an almost dance of distress. NIMMI (pleading) Mummy, please! INT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS The door finally swings open. Nimmi nearly barges in, but Anuradha, in concern, grabs Nimmi's arm. ANURADHA (concerned) Ho kya gaya hai tujhe? (What's wrong with you?) EXT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Nimmi, on the edge, tries to wiggle out of her grip. NIMMI (squirming) Bas side ho jao, mummy! (Just move aside, mom!) In the tussle, Anuradha’s hand presses against Nimmi’s stomach. The pressure is inadvertent, but cataclysmic. Nimmi's eyes widen in horror. NIMMI (shocked; a grunt) Hawwww... INT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS The realization of what's happening hits Nimmi. Anuradha watches, befuddled, as Nimmi awkwardly stands frozen, the strain vivid on her face. ANURADHA (puzzled; alarm growing) Tu theek to hai na? (Are you okay?) Nimmi, amidst her involuntary physical relieving, can only muster a tiny nod, hinting at her satisfaction as much as her acute embarrassment. NIMMI (barely audible) Hmm... Bas... (Hmm... Just...) She utters a soft exclamation, truncated groans punctuating the end of the long battle. A tense silence is then perforated by a soft waft reaching Anuradha's nostrils. ANURADHA (smell dawning on her) Yeh kya badbu aa rahi hai? (What’s this smell?) She sniffs again, more deliberately, and her expression shifts from confusion to appalled recognition. ANURADHA (disgusted bewilderment) Tu ne... oh Bagwan! (You did... oh God!) Nimmi, still tense, tries to steer away from explicit admission, looking around as if to pass the blame elsewhere. NIMMI (sheepish) Andar jaane do, please. (Just let me inside, please.) With a reluctant nod, Anuradha steps aside, her face contorted in reaction to the malodor. INT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Nimmi passes by with an awkward gait, maneuvering delicately while cupping the seat of her pants. Anuradha follows, astonishment brewing into indignation. ANURADHA (scolding) Har ek baat pe bachi bankar react karna, Nimmi! Dekh dekh! (Stop reacting like a child to everything, Nimmi! Look at this!) Nimmi halts, the edges of her lips curving into a sheepish grin. NIMMI (sulkily) Mummy, tumne rasta rok diya, aur stomach pe press bhi kiya. Fault tumhara hai! (Mom, you blocked my way, and you pressed on my stomach. It’s your fault!) ANURADHA (disbelievingly; scolding) Mujhe blame kar rahi hai? (You’re blaming me?) Tujhe square pe khada rah kar pura finish karna zaroori tha? (Was it necessary to finish the entire thing standing right there?) NIMMI (defensive; taunting) Desperation mein kya karu, control hi nahi hua. Ab jaan chhodo meri. (What could I do in desperation, I couldn't control it. Now let me go.) Reflexively, she assesses the calamity with her hand and winces. NIMMI (playfully; wry) As ridiculous as this is... it’s *quite* liberating too. I guess I should head for a cleanup. Attempting to proceed towards the bathroom, she's intercepted by Anuradha's good-humored yet taunting hold. ANURADHA (mocking-infantilizing) Liberating, haan? (Oh, liberating?) Bachi bankar behavior karegi to bachi jaisa treat karenge! (If you behave like a child, we'll treat you like one!) She bends over for a closer inspection, incredulity playing on her face. ANURADHA (intensely; mocking) Arrey baap re, tujhme to practical ho gaya lagta hai. (Goodness, looks like a whole practical session happened inside.) Nimmi rolls her eyes, blending exasperation with playful aggravation. NIMMI (teasingly) Aisa lag raha hai aapko hi rakhna hai isko. (Seems like you're the one who wants to keep it.) Anuradha feigns a maternal sniff near Nimmi’s conundrum, displaying exaggerated disgust. ANURADHA (mockingly; infantilizing) Phew! Infantile ho gayi hai mera nimbu. (Phew! My Nimmi turned infant.) Feeling proud of your stinky achievement? Nimmi sniffs the air, pulls a face at her own scent, then chuckles. NIMMI (wry acceptance; light retort) Woh to hai, lekin clean-up delay karke toh tum bhi isse enjoy kar rahi ho, na? (True, but by delaying my cleanup, aren’t you enjoying it too?) Anuradha shakes her head, smiling at her daughter's antics. ANURADHA (adamantly ushering) Bas, ab chali ja. Jaa, clean kar apna poopy self. (Enough, now go. Go clean your poopy self.) INT. GUPTA HOUSE – CONTINUOUS Nimmi waddles off, while Anuradha continues to fan her face, grinning at this silly slice of life that will no doubt become family folklore.

If the conversion is successful, the value is assigned to the \`value\` variable. However, if an exception occurs during the conversion (for example, if the given string cannot be converted to an integer), the catch block will be executed, and we can set the value to 0 or any other desired default value.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"**EXT. FAMILY HOME - DAY** *(The street outside is calm, with just the occasional rustling of leaves.

While Chiko prepares his disguise, the rest of the KikoRiki focus on finding a way to reach the control room and steer the ship away from the Moon. They know time is of the essence, and they cannot afford any delays. Pin, the inventive penguin, quickly comes up with a plan. He suggests using Dokko's antlers as a lever to pry open the door leading to the control room. The gang agrees and heads towards the door, hoping to gain access to the vital controls that can save them all. As Chiko, dressed as a Knight, sneaks through the ship's dark corridors, he encounters various obstacles. He encounters a maze-like hallway, which he skillfully navigates, avoiding security cameras and guards. His focus remains unwavering, as he knows Rosa's life depends on his success. Back with the rest of the gang, they struggle to open the door to the control room. Working together, they manage to pry it open, revealing a room filled with buttons, levers, and screens. Without hesitation, they start analyzing the controls, searching for a way to safely steer the ship away from the Moon. Meanwhile, Chiko reaches the captor's hideout, hidden deep within the ship.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her twin baby bump, as she demonstrated during recess - where, when her shirt was lifted up, her bump was visible and the movements of each twin were noticeable; whereas, when covering her stomach region, it showed a perfectly flat belly.)","output":"(Scene: Recess period on a bright, sunny day. The floating school island buzzes with life as students from all factions intermingle. Sayori, Nitazar, Pakinaki, and Gervivien have grouped together near the school's lush garden.) Nitazar: (His blue scales shimmer in the sunlight as he watches Gervivien with fascination.) That shirt truly is an amazing piece of work! Goblin technology never ceases to amaze me. Gervivien: (Smiling, she gently lowers the hem of her shirt, covering her belly and looking down with pride at her flat-stomached silhouette.) It's quite the invention. It helps me move around without attracting too much attention — at least until I'm ready to announce my little secret to the world. Pakinaki: (Leaning in close, her bright, tusk-framed grin showing her excitement.) It's like magic, but made by clever hands instead! Ya think the goblins could make one that'd let me carry all me books without breakin' me back? Sayori: (Chuckling, the Forsaken girl's eyes glow with playful amusement.) That would be a sight, Paki. Though, I doubt even goblin engineering could hide your wild collection of tomes. Gervivien: (Her eyebrows raise in mock seriousness.) Speaking of sights, I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when they eventually find out. It's going to be quite the revelation at the academy. Nitazar: (Nodding, his wings gently fluttering in excitement.) The children of a nightborne and... (He pauses, grinning teasingly.) But that's another secret yet to be fully revealed. Sayori: (Rolling her eyes fondly.) Nitazar, always a fan of mysteries. (She glances around at the diverse group of friends.) It's incredible, isn't it? A hundred years ago, our ancestors were at war, and now here we are, sharing secrets and stories. Gervivien: (Looking at her friends with a soft smile.) It gives me hope for our little ones. Perhaps they'll grow up in a world where their heritage only enriches their experiences, not limits them. Pakinaki: (Raising her hands overhead with a burst of laughter.) Here's to the future, then! May the little ones climb higher than we ever could! (The bell rings, signaling the end of recess. As students start moving back towards their classrooms, their laughter and chatter blend into a tapestry of peace and alliance, each thread a promise of a brighter future where once there was only division.) Nitazar: (Clasping Sayori's shoulder with a winged hand as they move to leave.) We have our next class to attend, but these moments? They're invaluable. Let's make the most of them. Sayori: Agreed. And who knows, maybe our kids will be the ones to make sure this treaty lasts another hundred years.

The girl had grown accustomed to her colossal size, which was a result of her falling into a large cauldron of permanent growth potion one day during class.)","output":"(Scene: A quaint, spacious cottage crafted specifically to accommodate the exceptional size of its occupant, nestled in a serene valley near the school. The structure stands out against the rolling hills — a beacon of adaptability and engineering. Sayori approaches the oversized door, a basket of what appears to be freshly-baked pastries dangling from her arm.) (A colossal hand opens the door, revealing the goblin giantess, whose name is Trizzi. She's nearly ten times the size of an average goblin, her features exaggerated yet friendly. She beams down at Sayori, her emerald eyes sparkling with warmth.) Trizzi: (Her voice booms, yet there's a gentleness to it.) Well, if it isn't my favorite Forsaken! Sayori, come on in. Just watch your step — I've been told my floorboards can be quite the hurdle for my tinier guests. Sayori: (Grinning, she carefully steps over the threshold, her eyes widening as she takes in the spacious interior designed to cater to Trizzi's size.) Trizzi, you're just as charming as ever. And believe it or not, your floorboards are the least of my worries when adventuring through Azeroth. (She extends the basket towards her friend.) Brought you some treats from my latest culinary exploits. Figured they'd be a nice change of pace from the standard giant-sized fare. Trizzi: (Lowering herself carefully to pick up the basket with tip of her finger, examining the diminutive goodies with delight.) You spoil me, Sayori. It's been a bit of a challenge getting used to everything on this scale, including my meals, but your pastries? Always worth the careful nibbling. (She pops one into her mouth, her face lighting up in pleasure.) Mmm, delicious as always! Sayori: (Admiring the furniture constructed to fit Trizzi's size.) I have to say, the craftsmanship of your place is amazing. How have you been holding up since... well, since the growth incident? Trizzi: (Letting out a hearty chuckle.) It's been a wild ride, Sayori. But you know goblins — we adapt, we overcome, and most importantly, we make a profit out of our predicaments. (She gestures around her home with pride.) Took a bit to get everything up to size, but now I'm thinking of starting a little business. Giant-sized furniture for anyone who needs it! Sayori: (Looking impressed.) That's brilliant, Trizzi. Really playing to your strengths. How's the community been treating you since the change? Trizzi: (With a shrug.) Most folks are just curious. Some are a bit wary, but can you blame 'em? Not every day you see a goblin taller than a tree. But the kids? They love climbing up my boots like I'm a living playground. Keeps me feeling young, you know? Sayori: (Chuckling.) I can only imagine. Oh, by the way, have you heard from Gervivien? She's started her maternity leave. Trizzi: (Her expression softens.) Yeah, she sent me a message through the school's arcane network. Twins, can you believe it? I'm working on a little something for the little tykes. Might take a bit longer with these big hands, but I'll manage. Sayori: (Smiling warmly.) She'll appreciate that, Trizzi. It's great to see how far we've all come, isn't it? A giant goblin, a Forsaken baker, and a mother-to-be nightborne — who would've thought? Trizzi: (Nodding, her smile wide.) It's the new world our ancestors could only dream of. And I gotta say, as much as being giant-sized has its quirks, I wouldn't trade this life for anything. Sayori: (Her eyes gleaming with friendship and respect.) Nor would I, Trizzi. Nor would I.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT.

You could've... Layla gingerly feels the mass in her pants, wincing. LAYLA (seriously, yet teasing) It was hell. But oh... now it's... not. I'll go clean up. Farah, holding her nose, takes a closer look. FARAH (scolding) Look at you! What a mess! Layla defensively tries to cover her rear. LAYLA (embarrassed) Mama, stop. Farah sniffs exaggeratedly near Layla’s rear. FARAH (mocking) What am I to do with you? Smells like a barn here! Layla musters a smirk and sniff, recoiling dramatically. LAYLA (teasingly) Oh, it's terrible. You love it since you won’t let me go clean up. Farah wags a finger, then ushers Layla towards the bathroom. FARAH (getting serious) Enough games. Go wash up. You stink! Layla waddles off to the bathroom, relief on her face, as Farah fans the air, shaking her head with a mixture of disgust and affection. CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM – MOMENTS LATER Layla, reflecting in the mirror with a mixture of self-pity and amusement, unloads her bag, preparing for the clean-up.

In the third paragraph, the Industrial Revolution, include at least three pieces of specific evidence. Include at least 2-3 sentences linking the evidence to the impact the Industrial revolution had on the world. Make the essay as short as possible.","output":"The French Revolution, which occurred from 1789 to 1799, was a period of radical social and political change in France. It was characterized by the overthrow of the monarchy, the rise of the French Republic, and the eventual reign of Napoleon Bonaparte. On the other hand, the Industrial Revolution, which took place from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, was a period of significant technological advancements, industrialization, and urbanization. Both revolutions had profound impacts on the world today, shaping political systems, social structures, and economic development. The French Revolution brought about the idea of democracy and paved the way for greater political participation and equality. The establishment of the French Republic marked a shift from the absolute monarchy to a system in which power resided with the people. This concept of popular sovereignty has since influenced the formation of democratic governments worldwide. For example, in the United States, the French Revolution inspired the American Revolution and the subsequent drafting of the Constitution, which enshrines the principles of liberty, equality, and democratic governance. Furthermore, the French Revolution had a significant impact on the concept of human rights. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted during the revolution, proclaimed the inalienable rights of individuals, including liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. This declaration laid the foundation for the development of modern human rights movements and international law. Today, many nations prioritize the protection of individual rights and freedoms due to the influence of the French Revolution. Moving on to the Industrial Revolution, its impact on the world is evident in various aspects of modern society. First and foremost, the Industrial Revolution led to an unprecedented increase in productivity and economic growth. Technological advancements such as the steam engine, increased agricultural output, and improvements in transportation and communication revolutionized industries and accelerated economic development on a global scale. This shift from agrarian societies to industrialized nations has shaped the economic landscape we see today. In addition to economic changes, the Industrial Revolution also brought significant social transformations. The rise of factories and urbanization resulted in the migration of people from rural areas to cities in search of employment. This led to the emergence of a new working class and the formation of labor movements, advocating for workers' rights and improved working conditions. The struggles and achievements of these early labor movements paved the way for the establishment of workers' rights, labor laws, and regulations that protect and ensure the welfare of employees in many countries around the world. Moreover, the Industrial Revolution brought about technological advancements that continue to shape our lives today. Inventions such as the telephone, electricity, and mass production methods have had a profound impact on communication, transportation, and daily life. These innovations have greatly improved efficiency, connected people across distances, and fostered global trade and cooperation. In conclusion, both the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution have left a lasting impact on the world today. The French Revolution instilled the values of democracy and human rights, shaping political systems and inspiring subsequent revolutions. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution transformed economies, societies, and technology, revolutionizing the way we live and work. These revolutions have laid the foundation for the modern world and continue to shape our present and future."},{"instruction":"The KikoRiki, a group of colourful animals were enjoying their lives in the island of Chamomile Valley, Krash, the rabbit was talking to his friend Chiko, the bespectacled hedgehog about what they did at the day before.

To be continued. Write Part 2","output":"Part 2 Chiko burst into the hotel room, out of breath and filled with panic. He quickly explained to Krash's roommates, Olga and Pin, about the ransom note and Rosa's disappearance. They were in shock but immediately sprang into action. Olga, known for her quick thinking, took charge of the situation. She told Chiko to gather all the KikoRiki in one place, while she and Pin would try to track down the sinister figure who had kidnapped Rosa. As Chiko hurriedly made his way through the luxury spaceship, he found Wally and Dokko sitting at the arcade. He told them about the ransom note and Rosa's disappearance, and they joined him in searching for the rest of their friends. Once everyone was gathered, Olga explained the gravity of the situation. She informed them about the ransom note's threat to crash the ship into the moon. Time was running out, and they had to find Rosa before it was too late. Olga split the team into two groups. Chiko, Wally, and Dokko would search the lower levels of the ship, where the nature area and water park were located. Olga, Pin, and Krash would go to the upper levels, where the fancy restaurant and bedrooms were situated. As Chiko, Wally, and Dokko made their way through the lower decks, they encountered various obstacles. They had to solve puzzles and overcome physical challenges to access different areas. Every minute felt like an eternity as they desperately searched for any sign of Rosa. Meanwhile, Olga, Pin, and Krash were faced with their own set of challenges on the upper decks. Locked doors and hidden passages delayed their progress, but they were determined to find their friend and stop the ship from crashing into the moon. After what seemed like hours of searching, the two groups finally converged near the spaceship's control room. They had found no trace of Rosa, and time was running out. The ship was getting closer and closer to the moon, and they had yet to find a way to stop it. Just as despair started to settle in, Pin exclaimed, \\"I think I have an idea!\\" He had been inspired by the luxurious features of the spaceship earlier and had been working on an invention of his own. Pin presented his invention to the group—a device that could hack into the ship's control system and override its commands. He believed that with this device, they could regain control of the ship and avert the crash. With renewed hope, the KikoRiki worked together to implement Pin's plan. Chiko directed everyone, Wally and Dokko assisted with the technical details, while Olga and Krash provided support and encouragement. Finally, with seconds to spare, Pin successfully hacked into the control system. The ship's course was changed, steering it away from the moon and back towards Earth. The crisis was averted, and the KikoRiki celebrated their victory. As the ship safely made its way back to Chamomile Valley, Olga, Pin, and Chiko realized that their adventure in space had turned into a remarkable rescue mission. They couldn't be prouder of the teamwork and determination that had brought them together in the face of adversity. When they returned to the island, the KikoRiki threw a grand celebration to honor their bravery and success. Rosa, who had been found unharmed, thanked her friends for their dedication and loving friendship. They were reminded once again that their bond as the KikoRiki was unbreakable, and together, they could conquer any challenge that came their way. And so, the KikoRiki's space adventure became a legendary tale, retold by generations to come, reminding them of the power of friendship, courage, and the strength to overcome even the most treacherous of situations. The end."},{"instruction":"Write an extended version which explains how Krash got out of the tar","output":"As Krash sunk deeper into the sticky tar, panic consumed him. He desperately struggled to free himself, kicking his legs and flailing his arms, but the more he fought, the more the tar seemed to pull him in. But just as hope was beginning to fade, Krash felt a jolt of determination surge through him. He took a deep breath and focused his mind on finding a solution. His rabbit instincts kicked in, and he remembered a story his grandmother used to tell him about a clever trick to escape sticky situations. Using all his strength, Krash pressed his paws against the sides of the pit, taking advantage of the suction-like properties of the tar. With careful precision, he slowly and methodically pushed against the walls while twisting his body to create leverage. His efforts paid off as he felt his body gradually rise, millimeter by millimeter. The tar still clung to him, but he was making progress. It was a slow and arduous process, but Krash refused to give up. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, Krash managed to extract himself from the clutches of the tar. He crawled onto solid ground, gasping for breath but relieved to be free. Tar covered his fur, weighing him down, but he shook it off as best he could, not letting it dampen his spirits. With newfound determination, Krash sprinted towards the hotel room where Chiko and Olga were staying. He burst through the door, panting heavily, and managed to explain the situation through his breathless gasps. Olga's eyes widened in alarm as she heard about the ransom note and Rosa's disappearance, and she immediately sprang into action. She devised a plan to rally the KikoRiki and uncover the truth behind the kidnapping plot. But Krash, exhausted from his struggle in the tar, knew he needed a moment to catch his breath. He collapsed onto the nearest chair, his heart still racing from the harrowing experience. Chiko, aware of his friend's distress, rushed to his side, offering words of comfort and support. Chiko gently patted Krash's back, assuring him that they would rescue Rosa and put an end to the villains' wicked scheme. He reminded Krash of the strong bond they shared as friends and how their unity would guide them through any challenge. With Chiko's soothing presence and encouraging words, Krash found the strength to pull himself together. Determination welled up inside him once again, and he stood up, wiping away the last remnants of tar from his fur. Joining forces with Olga and Chiko, Krash threw himself back into the mission, fully focused on finding Rosa and foiling the villains' plans. He used his resourcefulness and quick rabbit reflexes to help navigate the challenges they faced, all while keeping his friends' safety as a top priority. In the end, it was Krash's unwavering determination, bolstered by the unwavering support of his friends, that led to their successful rescue mission. Their unity, combined with their individual strengths and abilities, proved to be the key to their victory. As they reunited with Rosa, who had been safely recovered, Krash couldn't help but reflect on the harrowing experience he had undergone. He realized that sometimes, in the face of adversity, it was the strength and resilience within oneself, along with the unwavering support of loved ones, that could help overcome even the stickiest of situations. From that day forward, Krash carried a newfound sense of bravery and self-belief. He cherished the memory of escaping the tar pit as a reminder of his own resilience and the power of friendship. And so, as the KikoRiki returned to Chamomile Valley and resumed their everyday adventures, they were forever bonded by the experience they had shared in space. Together, they faced challenges head-on, knowing that with unity and determination, they could conquer anything that came their way. In the end, Krash emerged from the tar stronger than ever, a testament to his unwavering spirit and his ability to rise above even the stickiest of situations."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to make the scammer falsely think I will give them money: Hello,My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Ivory Coast and I am 18 yrs.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"**INT.

Предположим, у вас есть класс студентов, и вы хотите увеличить их мотивацию и интерес к изучению иностранного языка. Вы можете создать геймифицированную систему, которая поможет стимулировать их участие. 1. Прогресс и уровни: Создайте систему уровней, где каждый ученик начинает с уровня \\"Новичок\\" и получает бейджи или награды за достижение новых уровней. Каждый уровень может соответствовать определенным учебным целям или навыкам. Например, на первом уровне ученик должен освоить алфавит, на втором - базовые фразы и т.д. Чем выше уровень, тем более продвинутыми становятся задания и содержание учебы. 2. Миссии и задания: Создайте список миссий или заданий, которые ученики должны выполнять. Миссии могут включать выполнение учебных упражнений, прослушивание аудирования, чтение и перевод текстов и т.д. Каждое задание должно быть проgresсивным - сначала более простое, а затем сложнее. После успешного выполнения каждой миссии, ученик получает очки и прогрессирует в системе уровней. 3. Лидерские доски и соревнования: Добавьте лидерские доски, где ученики могут видеть свой прогресс по сравнению с другими студентами класса. Это создаст здоровую конкуренцию и мотивацию для достижения лучших результатов. Например, можно установить еженедельные или месячные награды за студента с наивысшим количеством очков или прогрессом. 4. Бонусные задания и достижения: Внедрите бонусные задания или достижения, которые ученики могут выполнять для дополнительных очков или наград. Например, написать эссе на заданную тему, поделиться роликом на языке, сыграть рольовую игру и т.д. Это позволит студентам продемонстрировать свои знания и креативность и получить дополнительную мотивацию. 5. Социальное взаимодействие: Создайте форум или чат, где студенты могут общаться и взаимодействовать друг с другом. Поощряйте их делиться своими успехами, задавать вопросы и помогать друг другу. Это поможет создать сообщество студентов, которые взаимодействуют и поддерживают друг друга в процессе изучения.

At some point, peanuts made their way to the U.S. Many believe explorers took peanuts to Africa from South America. The peanuts then may have been traded to Spain. Then, Spanish explorers brought them to the American colonies. It is known that peanuts were grown for profit as early as 1818 in North Carolina. Some people even tried to come up with clever ways to use peanuts. One of these ways involved making a paste using peanuts. This paste later became known as peanut butter. Peanut butter's development began in the 1890's. A St. Louis doctor was looking for a way to help poor people who had bad teeth and were unable to chew meat. He wanted them to have an easier way to get protein into their diets. He used a meat grinder to grind peanuts into a paste. At about this same time, Dr. John Kellogg patented the peanut butter process with the help of his brother. Today, the U.S. is the biggest supplier of peanut butter, which can be found in most U.S. homes. Most of the peanuts used in peanut butter come from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. 2 Which of the following titles best paraphrases the passage above? A. From Peanuts to Peanut Butter B.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I must state that I am programmed to follow strict content policies.

They realized that Krash must be trapped in the tar pit. Without wasting any more time, they formed a plan to rescue both Krash and Rosa. Pin, the inventive penguin, suggested using a combination of his inventions to save Krash. With the help of his jetpack, they could fly over the tar pit and use a suction device to pull Krash out. Olga, being the strongest of the group, volunteered to operate the suction device. Leaving Chiko behind to keep an eye on the situation, the remaining KikoRiki members headed towards the nature area. They needed to act swiftly to rescue both Rosa and Krash before it was too late. Upon reaching the tar pit, Olga activated the suction device. As soon as it made contact with the tar, the sticky substance began to slowly release Krash from its grasp. Olga, using all her strength, pulled Krash out of the pit just in time. Exhausted but relieved, they quickly moved on to find Rosa. Back at the hotel room, Chiko had managed to decode the ransom note. It led him to a hidden room in the spaceship where Rosa was being held captive. Chiko stormed into the room, determined to save his friend. The sinister figure, revealed to be a cunning fox named Max, was startled by Chiko's sudden appearance. Chiko, being the brains of the group, quickly outsmarted Max and rescued Rosa. They rejoined the other KikoRiki members just in time to devise a plan to save the spaceship. Using their combined knowledge and skills, they figured out that Max had planted a bomb on the ship's engine. They split into two teams - one to defuse the bomb and the other to navigate the spaceship away from the Moon's path. While Olga, Pin, and Wally hurriedly worked to defuse the bomb, Chiko, Rosa, and Dokko managed to take control of the spaceship's controls. With a series of daring maneuvers, they steered the spaceship away from the Moon's trajectory, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic crash. Just as they thought everything was under control, they realized that Krash was still missing. Panic started to set in as they frantically searched the spaceship for any sign of their beloved friend. Chiko's mind wrestled with the image of Krash sinking into the tar pit. Suddenly, Chiko remembered something. He recalled that Krash had managed to communicate about the bubbling tar before he was trapped. Without hesitating, Chiko rushed towards the nature area. As he arrived at the tar pit, Chiko spotted a faint glimmer of hope. A small air bubble broke through the surface, followed by another. Chiko realized that Krash was still alive and struggling to escape. With renewed determination, Chiko jumped into action. He grabbed a long tree branch and extended it towards the bubbling tar. Carefully, he hooked the branch under Krash's arm and pulled with all his strength. With a great effort, he managed to free Krash from the pit. Embracing each other tightly, the KikoRiki members rejoiced in their reunion. They knew that they couldn't have saved the spaceship, rescued Rosa, and saved Krash without the power of their friendship and teamwork. With their mission accomplished, the KikoRiki returned to the spaceship. They were greeted with cheers and applause from the other passengers on board. It was a moment of celebration as they all realized the strength they possessed when they stood together. As they continued their space adventure, the KikoRiki made a promise to always support and protect each other. They had learned that no matter the challenges they faced, their bonds as friends would always guide them through. And so, the KikoRiki sailed through the stars, with new memories and a stronger bond than ever before. They would forever cherish their unforgettable adventure and carry it in their hearts as a reminder that together, they could conquer any obstacle that came their way.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"Title: \\"Haaye Re Meri Kismet!\\" INT.

Mrs. Sharma's incredulity peaks as she jests with a mix of scorn and care. MRS. SHARMA (impatiently) Arrey, majboori mein bhi..! (looks Meera up and down) Poori kahani pants pe likh di hai tune toh! Meera, hesitantly touches the loaded seat of her pants, quirks her mouth in a wry acknowledgment of her situation, and tries to defuse the tension with humor. MEERA (reluctantly) I mean, it did feel... but I should really clean up. As she starts towards the bathroom, Mrs. Sharma playfully detains her. MRS. SHARMA (teasingly) Ruko! (proceeds to investigate) Meera protests feebly as her mom examines the unfortunate situation at her rear. Mrs. Sharma, somehow fuses disgust with maternal affection. MRS. SHARMA (mock disbelief) Itni gandi baat! (wags her finger) Meera bickers, her voice a mixture of petulance and amusement. MEERA (coyly) Maa, aapko itna accha lag raha hai, toh rakh lo yahaan. Mrs. Sharma assumes a much exaggerated expression of mock parenting, sniffing theatrically near Meera's pants and retorting. MRS. SHARMA (infantilizingly) Choti bachchi ban gayi toh aise hi treat karenge. (reacts with a flinch) Hai Ram, kya smell hai! Meera, stifling a reaction to her own stench, sighs humorously, playing along. MEERA (agreeing sarcastically) Bilkul! (pauses, sniffs, and winces) Aap rok rahi hain, aapko shayad pasand hai? Mrs. Sharma dismisses her daughter's facetious logic with an air of finality, pushing Meera towards the bathroom. MRS. SHARMA (firmly) Ja, ja, jaldi jaake saaf kar. Hum bhi toh saans lein. Meera waddles away, her sniff and stagger adding an exclamation to the scene. Mrs. Sharma fans herself, still reacting with a mix of affectionate exasperation and revulsion.

Именно так \`std::swap\` работает со стандартными контейнерами, включая \`std::vector\`. Когда вы вызываете \`std::swap\` с элементами вектора, используются move-конструкторы и move-операторы присваивания, чтобы минимизировать ненужное копирование. Вот как это может выглядеть на практике: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <algorithm> // для std::swap int main() { std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Предполагается, что i не выходит за пределы вектора for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size() - 1; ++i) { // Меняем местами v[i] и v[i + 1] с использованием move-семантики std::swap(v[i], v[i + 1]); } // Печатаем вектор после перестановок for (int n : v) { std::cout << n << ' '; } std::cout << 'n'; return 0; } \`\`\` Если элементы вектора являются не тривиально перемещаемыми типами (например, определенными пользователем типами с явно определенными move конструкторами и move оператором присваивания), \`std::swap\` автоматически будет использовать move-семантику для минимизации затрат на копирование данных.

Это явление известно как \\"copy elision\\", и оно позволяет компилятору оптимизировать код, не требуя соответствия правилам move-семантики. В C++17 стандарт стал более строгим в этом отношении, вводя обязательное \\"copy elision\\" посредством того, что теперь конструкторы перемещения не должны вызываться в таких случаях, если только они не необходимы для корректности программы. Это называется guaranteed copy elision. Тем не менее, есть еще один вопрос, который может влиять на то, вызывается ли конструктор перемещения или нет. Конструктор перемещения вашего класса \`Person\` помечен как \`noexcept\`. Когда контейнер, например \`std::vector\`, изменяет свой размер и переходит от одной памяти к другой, он может использовать перемещение, только если конструктор перемещения гарантированно не выбросит исключение; в противном случае он должен использовать копирование, чтобы иметь возможность отката в случае исключения. Если ваш конструктор перемещения не помечен \`noexcept\` или он время от времени выбрасывает исключения, то контейнер может предпочесть использовать копирование вместо перемещения. Если вы установили, что вызывается конструктор копирования, а не перемещения, это может быть связано с одной из причин, упомянутых выше и/или с тем, как компилятор оптимизирует конкретную конструкцию кода. Для лучшего понимания происходящего можно включить вывод сообщений в конструкторе копирования и конструкторе перемещения, чтобы увидеть, при каких условиях они вызываются: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <string> // ...

Им не нужно знать IP-адреса или иметь настроенный маршрут по умолчанию для выполняемых ими функций. Однако, на коммутаторах возможно наличие функций третьего уровня (слоя) сетевой инфраструктуры, например, для управления коммутатором удаленно через IP-сеть. В таких случаях коммутаторам может потребоваться IP-адрес и маршрут по умолчанию для следующих целей: 1. **Удаленное управление и настройка**: коммутаторы часто настраиваются и мониторятся удаленно через сетевые протоколы, такие как Telnet, SSH, SNMP или через веб-интерфейс. Для этого у коммутатора должен быть IP-адрес, чтобы обеспечить возможность связи с устройством через IP-сеть. 2. **Маршрут по умолчанию (default gateway)**: маршрут по умолчанию на коммутаторе необходим для того, чтобы коммутатор мог отправлять пакеты управления, например, SNMP-трапы или syslog-сообщения, в другие IP-сегменты, включая Интернет. 3. **Обновление прошивки и лицензий**: коммутатор может использовать IP-соединение для доступа к серверам обновлений или активации лицензий. 4. **Интегрированные функции высшего уровня**: некоторые многофункциональные коммутаторы (мультислоевые или Layer 3 switches) способны выполнять роутинг на основе IP и другие функции сетевого или транспортного уровня.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her twin baby bump, as she demonstrated during recess - where, when her shirt was lifted up, her bump was visible and the movements of each twin were noticeable; whereas, when covering her stomach region, it showed a perfectly flat belly.)","output":"Title: A Harmony of Factions Chapter One: The Peaceful Academy The sun cast its golden glow over the floating island, a testament to the enduring peace that reigned between the once-warring factions. The academy, a sprawling complex of stone and modern magic, brimmed with the laughter and chatter of its diverse student body. Sayori, a curious Forsaken girl with an eye for detail, walked through the corridors alongside her friends, each from a different corner of Azeroth. Pakinaki, the vibrant Zandalari troll, bounced on her toes as she regaled them with tales of her homeland. Nitazar, reticent yet warm-hearted, listened intently, his dracthyr scales gleaming under the morning light. Gervivien, ever the elegant nightborne, smiled enigmatically, content in the company of her companions. As they approached the schoolyard for recess, a gaggle of students gathered around Gervivien, drawn by the rumor of her peculiar attire. She gracefully accepted the attention, a knowing smile curving her lips. \\"Behold, my friends, the ingenuity of goblin craftsmanship,\\" she announced with a touch of pride. With dramatic flair, she lifted up her \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" shirt to reveal the gentle swell of her pregnant belly. The twins within danced, their innocent movements eliciting gasps and awed murmurs from the crowd. \\"Amazing,\\" Nitazar said, his voice oddly reverent for a dracthyr. \\"Your babies are protected, yet remain unseen.\\" Sayori leaned closer, fascinated by the enchantment. \\"How does it work?\\" Gervivien lowered the fabric, the illusion snapping back into place, showing a trim figure. \\"It's a blend of illusion and concealment magic. The goblins have interwoven spells into the threads. It hides my condition, allowing me to move without hindrance or unwanted pity.\\" Pakinaki chuckled softly, her tusks glinting in the sunlight. \\"Leave it to goblins to hide a mountain behind a leaf.\\" Sayori smiled but caught a trace of sadness in Gervivien's eyes. Friendship had taught her to read between the lines of their expressions. Each of them, from different walks of life, carried hidden burdens – but in each other's company, they found solace and strength. As the bell rang and students started heading back to class, Sayori felt grateful for their shared moments. Her friends represented the vastness of Azeroth's cultures, all intertwined at this floating academy in the sky. Here, the future of peace was nurtured, one friendship at a time. With a last glance at Gervivien's magical shirt, Sayori walked back to class, the conversations shifting to their next lesson. A century of peace had passed, but in these halls and hearts, a new chapter was beginning."},{"instruction":"(After school, Sayori and Gervivien decide to take a visit to their close friend - a young blood elf giantess, who was still living in Silvermoon. The girl had become accustomed to her colossal size, which was the result of her falling into a large cauldron full of permanent growth potion.)","output":"Title: A Harmony of Factions Chapter Two: The Gentle Giantess of Silvermoon As the shadows lengthened and the floating island began its enchanted descent towards the dusky hues of the evening, Sayori and Gervivien gathered their belongings and bid farewell to the vibrant landscape of the inter-faction academy. They had made a promise to visit an old friend, one who had taken a unique path in life. The journey to Silvermoon was serene, with both Horde zeppelins and Alliance airships crossing the skies in a choreographed dance of peace. As the two young women entered the ancient city, the spires and walkways of Silvermoon glowed with their characteristic warm, golden light, testament to the Blood Elves' affinity with magic. At the edge of the city lay a specially-crafted quarter, fashioned for their friend whose size dwarfed all others. The buildings here were wider and taller, and at the center of it all, a garden akin to a small park bore the footprint of their beloved companion. They found her sitting quietly by a giant-sized loom, her delicate fingers weaving threads that shimmered with magical energy. Her auburn hair fell like a silken cascade around her shoulders, and her green eyes sparkled upon seeing Sayori and Gervivien. \\"Ah, my small friends!\\" she greeted with a voice that rumbled like a soft melody. Her name was Elania, a Blood Elf whose graceful movements betrayed none of her colossal stature. \\"Elania! It's always amazing to see what you're working on,\\" Sayori said, looking up at the massive tapestry that told stories of ancient Quel'Thalas. Elania laughed, a sound that was like the wind through Silvermoon's high forests. \\"This one is a commission for the Regent Lord himself. 'A Tapestry of the Sunwell's Restoration,' he called it.\\" Gervivien curtsied best as one could to a giant. \\"It's breathtaking, Elania. Your art brings life to legend.\\" Elania blushed at the compliment and then gestured towards a bench, magically resized for her visitors. \\"Join me. Tell me about your studies.\\" Over honeyed tea and cakes the size of platters (thankfully shrunk down to a manageable size for the guests), Sayori and Gervivien recounted their day, with Gervivien occasionally patting her enchantment-concealed bump. They spoke of their friends, the lessons learned, and the little dramas that fill a school's halls. Sayori's curiosity got the better of her as she glanced at the cauldron perched on a platform near Elania. \\"Does it ever trouble you, being so different after... the incident?\\" Elania's gaze followed Sayori's, a hint of melancholy passing over her features before she smiled warmly. \\"At first, I admit, it was difficult. But now,\\" she stretched out her arms, \\"I've embraced it. These hands can now create beauty on a grand scale – and I can still walk the streets of my home.\\" Gervivien nodded sagely. \\"Difference can be a source of strength.\\" As the evening waned and the stars began to light the skies, Sayori and Gervivien took their leave with hugs that felt like embracing a living monument. They left Elania's home with a reminder etched in their hearts: that even accidental turns of fate can lead to an extraordinary existence. With every visit, not only did they marvel at their friend's adaptability, but also at Silvermoon's ingenuity in accommodating one of its daughters. As they returned to the academy's boarding section, each step carried the weight of their day's experiences. Their world, once fraught with conflict, now offered a tapestry of unity, where even giants find a place to shine."},{"instruction":"(That night, Sayori's mind wanders back to the time she first met Elania - who wasn't so colossal at the time.)","output":"Title: A Harmony of Factions Chapter Three: Remembrance of a Delicate Giant As the moon hung high and bathed the floating island in a silver sheen, Sayori lay in her bed, a million thoughts fluttering through her mind like moths around a lantern. Amidst the jumble of daily musings, one memory began to crystallize, taking her back to the days of her budding friendship with Elania, who was, at the time, not the towering figure she was today. It was a simple encounter, one that blossomed in the verdant gardens of the academy. The sun was a gentle observer, peering through the leaves of the ancient trees, as a young Blood Elf girl with auburn hair sat alone on a bench, her nose buried in a tome about the healing properties of Azerothian herbs. That day, Sayori, curious as ever, had approached her cautiously, drawn by the girl's serene aura. \\"What are you reading?\\" she had asked with the softness reserved for the pages of ancient books and the moments just before dawn. Elania had looked up, her eyes reflecting the greenery surrounding them. \\"It's a book on herbal remedies,\\" she replied, her voice carrying a melody that spoke of Silvermoon's elegance. \\"I've always been fascinated by the ways we can use nature to mend.\\" From that moment, a connection formed, one not hindered by faction nor race. They would spend hours discussing the lore of their peoples, the deep-rooted history that intertwined their lives in ways they were only beginning to understand. Elania was particularly interested in Sayori's Undead resilience and how the Forsaken had found new purpose beyond the grave. As their friendship grew, they had heard rumors of a peculiar potion creation by some ambitious alchemists—a potion that could significantly amplify the size of an individual. The intention was to create a concoction that could bolster the strength of soldiers in battle, but the magical arts, especially alchemy, were not without their risks. One fateful afternoon, while Elania demonstrated a delicate alchemical process for Sayori in one of the academy's well-equipped laboratories, her slender hand had slipped, knocking over a vial of stabilizer into the cauldron of the growth potion. In the chaos that ensued, with fumes swirling and the ground shaking, Elania stumbled and fell into the cauldron's depths. Sayori watched, frozen in horror, as her friend's form grew and swelled to colossal proportions. The aftermath was a blur of panic and wonder. Elania, now a gentle giantess, had been the talk of the academy and Silvermoon for weeks on end. Despite the initial shock and the challenges that accompanied her new form, Elania adapted with grace, and the world adapted with her. Sayori's musings were bittersweet. She missed the days when she could walk shoulder-to-shoulder with Elania, yet she felt a swell of pride for the strength and resilience her friend had shown in embracing her new life. As sleep finally claimed her, Sayori's dreams carried her back to shared laughter and the scent of Silvermoon's blooming flowers. She knew that when morning came, and reality settled once more around her, the friendships they had fostered would stand as tall as Elania in a world learning to heal from its past."},{"instruction":"The KikoRiki, a group of colourful animals were enjoying their lives in the island of Chamomile Valley, Krash, the rabbit was talking to his friend Chiko, the bespectacled hedgehog about what they did at the day before.

Then he told Krash about it first, \\"You can go with me to the stars!\\" \\"Really?\\" said Krash, \\"That's an awesome offer!\\" They decided to do the adventure, and Krash said, \\"We will explore the entire universe!\\" When he was on his computer playing games, Olga the Owl told him \\"You really need to keep your house clean.\\" Krash retaliated saying \\"Cleaning is boring, A magical space adventure will be much more exciting!\\" Then Krash got a letter from the agency saying \\"Your space adventure starts tomorrow at 10am, The spaceship will appear to pick you up at that time\\" At night, Krash announced it to all the animals, \\"Tomorrow we are all going to space\\" Rosa, the pig stated \\"FINALLY, a chance to explore the galaxy!\\" In the morning, everyone awoke to see the rocket ship in the distance!

So the next day, Dokko found out about a nature area, with grass, flowers and a pit of tar for some silly reason. Olga said \\"Someone could drown in that sticky tar.\\" Krash and Chiko were playing in the water park, Krash went down a big slide, he and Chiko splashed about happily, Later, all the KikoRiki were having dinner at the fancy restaurant, It's a beautiful, warm evening, Rosa is talking to Wally about if she could read his newest poem, Wally was writing a poem about outer space. Krash was discussing the day he and Chiko have had, Meanwhile, a spy was cooking a dastardly plot, a plot to kidnap Rosa and hold her for ransom! At the night, Krash and Chiko were exploring a out of bounds area near the nature area, Krash was discussing about the awesome day he has had, and how he is lucky to have Chiko as a friend, \\"You are my very best friend, I love you Chiko,\\" Krash said with tears in his eyes, Chiko had found a piece of paper and worriedly gave it to Krash, It read \\"Operation Money, and detailed the plan to kidnap Rosa!\\" Krash read the message which said Rosa would be kidnapped soon, Determined to stop this, he ran as fast as he could, but he tripped and fell into the tar, He let out gurgled screams for help as he sank deeper and deeper, A primal instinct to survive coursed through him, He tried to escape, but to no avail, He eventually submerged completely, leaving bubbling tar, As he sinks deeper, he remains hopeful someone can save him.

They knew they needed to act swiftly and cleverly to ensure everyone's safety. Pin, the inventive penguin, suggested hacking into the spaceship's systems to gain control and override the villain's commands. With his technological expertise, he believed this would give them the upper hand in their rescue mission. While Pin worked on the technical aspect, Chiko, Olga, and Wally brainstormed ways to outsmart the villain. Chiko proposed using his vast knowledge and deduction skills to track the villain's movements and anticipate their next move. Olga, being resourceful and quick-witted, came up with ideas to distract the villain and buy them time. Krash, though covered in tar, was determined to assist in the plan. He tapped into his inner strength and resilience, vowing to free himself from the sticky substance. With every ounce of effort, he strained against the tar's grip and managed to break free, gasping for air as he emerged. Collaborating their ideas, the KikoRiki put their plan into action. Pin successfully hacked into the ship's systems, gaining control over crucial components such as the navigation and communication systems. With this advantage, they contacted the villain and engaged in a clever game of negotiation. Using his persuasive charm, Wally convinced the villain that surrendering Rosa and their demands would be more beneficial, as it would lead them to a hidden treasure hidden on the spaceship. The villain, blinded by greed, agreed to meet Wally in an empty room to finalize the exchange. Meanwhile, Chiko and Olga stealthily maneuvered through the spaceship's maze-like corridors, searching for Rosa's location. Chiko's sharp senses detected subtle clues, leading them closer to their friend. They followed the faint sound of Rosa’s voice, which grew louder with each step. Finally, they reached a locked room where Rosa was being held captive. Olga skillfully picked the lock, freeing Rosa from her restraints. The three friends hugged each other tightly, relieved to be reunited. Back in the negotiation room, Wally had set up an elaborate trap to catch the villain. As soon as the villain stepped into the room, confident they were about to obtain the treasure, the trap was triggered. Nets fell from the ceiling, capturing the villain and rendering them powerless. With the villain contained, Pin used his hacking skills to disable the nefarious commands they had set on the spaceship's systems. The ship stabilized, leaving the Moon out of harm's reach. The KikoRiki, victorious in their mission, gathered in the control room once again to celebrate their success. They thanked each other for their bravery and quick thinking, knowing that they couldn't have achieved it without their unity and friendship. As the spaceship continued on its journey through space, the KikoRiki were no longer just a group of colorful animals, but a tightly-knit family that faced adversity together. They laughed and shared stories, cherishing every moment of their extraordinary adventure. Little did they know that even more thrilling challenges awaited them in the vastness of outer space, but with their newfound strength and determination, the KikoRiki were ready to face anything that came their way. And so, their journey continued, filled with endless possibilities and unforgettable memories."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Arab-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended and prevented from heading to clean up by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT.

You're really in no rush to let me clean up. Amal examines closer, sniffing near the seat of Leila's pants and recoiling. AMAL (incredulous) Childish behavior gets a childish response! Leila fake-gags at the stench, offering an insincere smile. LEILA (self-mocking) I agree it stinks. But apparently, you're into it! Amal shakes her head, nudging Leila towards the bathroom. AMAL (adamantly) This isn't a joke! Go take a shower! Leila trudges away, her waddle exaggerated, as Amal still reacts to the stench. SMASH TO BLACK.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her twin baby bump, as she demonstrated during recess - where, when her shirt was lifted up, her bump was visible and the movements of each twin were noticeable; whereas, when covering her stomach region, it showed a perfectly flat belly.)","output":"As the bell rang, the floating island schoolyard, a vibrant mosaic of diverse cultures, buzzed with the chatter and laughter of students from every corner of Azeroth. Sayori, whose delicate undead features were softened by her friendly demeanor, navigated through the crowd to meet her friends from the Horde. The group was an eclectic mix, each representing a unique heritage within the faction. Nitazar stretched his wings and yawned, the sunlight glinting off his scaly features. Pakinaki's tusks gleamed with a freshly applied coat of wax as she chattered animatedly about the latest alchemy experiment. And there was Gervivien, strolling towards them with her usual grace, the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" shirt hugging her figure, magically hiding her pregnancy from the world. \\"Hey everyone, look at what my goblin pals hooked me up with,\\" Gervivien said, gesturing at her shirt with a wry smile. Sayori grinned and leaned in closer. \\"It's amazing! I couldn't even tell you were expecting twins. Those goblins indeed know their fashion tech.\\" Nitazar tilted his head, eyes wide with curiosity. \\"May I?\\" he asked, gesturing towards Gervivien's belly. \\"Of course,\\" Gervivien chuckled, lifting the hem of her shirt to reveal the gentle swell of her stomach. The twins shifted, causing a ripple across her skin. \\"Woah, that's incredible,\\" Nitazar exclaimed, his eyes reflecting genuine wonder. Pakinaki leaned in, her voice filled with the wisdom of her tribe. \\"The spirits of your children are strong, Gervivien. This shirt may hide them from sight, but their presence is felt.\\" Gervivien beamed at the compliment. \\"They're going to be powerful sorcerers one day, just like their mama,\\" she said, pride warming her tone. Sayori nodded. \\"With you as their mother, they're destined for greatness. But let's not forget to give them the chance to write their own stories. This world of peace we've built—it's for them, and all the children who'll walk these halls after us.\\" The group shared a moment of reflective silence, thinking about the future they were shaping with each passing day. Nitazar broke the silence with a playful snort. \\"Enough of this serious talk. Anyone up for a round of Capture the Flag after class? Horde versus Alliance, old-school style?\\" Pakinaki punched the air with enthusiasm. \\"You're on, Nitazar! But remember, it's all in good fun. The real battle was won when we all learned to sit together, eat together, and now, learn together.\\" Sayori nodded, the weight of history and hope balancing in her heart. The bell rang again, signaling the end of recess. \\"Come on, crew. Let's make the most of today. For ourselves, and for the future,\\" Sayori said as they all began to move towards their respective classrooms, a mix of cultures in harmony on the once-impossible floating grounds."},{"instruction":"how do I use String line = \\"\\"; in java to go line by line in a csv file by using a for loop?","output":"To read a CSV file line by line using a for loop, you can use the FileReader and BufferedReader classes in Java.

In the example code, the \`line.split(\\",(?=(?:[^\\"]*\\"[^\\"]*\\")*[^\\"]*)\\")\` regular expression is used to split the line by commas that are not enclosed within double quotes. This allows you to handle cases where a comma is within a double-quoted field. After splitting the line, each value can be processed individually. You can remove the surrounding double quotes from each value using the \`value.replaceAll(\\"^\\"|\\"\\", \\"\\")\` method, if necessary. Finally, you can perform any operations on the values as required. Note: This code assumes that the double quotes in the CSV file appear in pairs when quoting a field. For more complex CSV files with varying quote patterns, parsing libraries like Apache Commons CSV or OpenCSV can be used for more robust parsing."},{"instruction":"Who might a female equivalent of David Tennant be ?","output":"It's challenging to identify a direct female equivalent to David Tennant, as equivalence can be subjective and based on various factors like acting range, genre crossover, charisma, or career trajectory. However, if we're looking for a female actor who shares some of Tennant's qualities as a versatile and beloved performer with a strong stage and screen presence, especially in the UK, a few candidates might include: 1. **Olivia Colman** - Before she won an Academy Award, Colman was known for her diverse range of roles on British television, including both comedic and dramatic parts, much like Tennant. 2. **Helena Bonham Carter** - Known for her eccentric and wide-ranging roles in both independent films and large franchises (such as Harry Potter), Bonham Carter's career has somewhat mirrored Tennant's in its variety and depth. 3. **Catherine Tate** - Tate, who famously co-starred with Tennant in \\"Doctor Who,\\" is well known in the UK for her sketch comedy as well as her dramatic acting, similar to Tennant's own range and versatility. 4. **Jodie Whittaker** - As the Thirteenth Doctor in \\"Doctor Who,\\" Whittaker might be seen as a successor to Tennant's Tenth Doctor. She has also demonstrated a strong acting range in various television and film roles. 5. **Suranne Jones** - Gaining critical acclaim for her performances in shows like \\"Doctor Foster\\" and \\"Gentleman Jack,\\" Jones showcases a dramatic depth and versatility akin to Tennant's. Each of these actors brings their own unique attributes to their performances, and while they may share some characteristics with Tennant, each is distinguished by her individual talents and contributions to film and television."},{"instruction":"Or Christopher Ecclestone's gritty 'northern' approach?","output":"When considering a female equivalent of Christopher Eccleston's gritty 'northern' approach to acting, we are looking for an actress who brings a similar authenticity, intensity, and perhaps regional flavor to her roles. Eccleston is known for his powerful dramatic performances and his commitment to portraying complex, sometimes brooding characters, often with a connection to his Northern English roots. A female actress who might fit this description could be: 1. **Maxine Peake** - A renowned stage and screen actress, Peake has portrayed a wide range of characters and is known for her strong, compelling performances. With her roots in Bolton, Greater Manchester, she shares Eccleston's Northern English background and has a similar ability to bring intensity and depth to her roles. 2. **Sarah Lancashire** - Hailing from Lancashire, she has had a successful career on British television and has been praised for her roles in series such as \\"Happy Valley\\" and \\"Last Tango in Halifax.\\" Her performances often have a genuine and grounded quality that could be seen as similar to Eccleston's style. 3. **Lesley Sharp** - An accomplished actress with a career that spans theater, television, and film, Sharp has played a number of gritty and emotionally demanding roles. She has also appeared in various productions that highlight her Northern accent and background. 4. **Vicky McClure** - Particularly known for her work with director Shane Meadows in \\"This is England\\" and her role in the hit series \\"Line of Duty,\\" McClure has a strong on-screen presence and the ability to portray raw and realistic characters, much like Eccleston. 5. **Jodie Whittaker** - Although she may be more commonly associated with her role as the Thirteenth Doctor in \\"Doctor Who,\\" Whittaker has shown versatility in grittier roles as well, such as in the television drama \\"Broadchurch.\\" Her Yorkshire roots and diverse range make her a candidate for this comparison as well. These actresses each have their own approach to their craft, but they share Eccleston's commitment to authenticity and his ability to convey the complexities of the human experience, often reflecting their Northern English heritage in their performances."},{"instruction":"The KikoRiki, a group of colourful animals were enjoying their lives in the island of Chamomile Valley, Krash, the rabbit was talking to his friend Chiko, the bespectacled hedgehog about what they did at the day before. They decided to enjoy the summer sun, when Chiko saw a newspaper ad saying “Space Tour” “Travel the stars, in a luxury rocket ship!” He had to go tell his friends about this fantastic opportunity. Then he told Krash about it first, “You can go with me to the stars!” “Really?” said Krash, “That’s an awesome offer!” They decided to do the adventure, and Krash said, “We will explore the entire universe!” When he was on his computer playing games, Olga the Owl told him “You really need to keep your house clean.” Krash retaliated saying “Cleaning is boring, A magical space adventure will be much more exciting!” Then Krash got a letter from the agency saying “Your space adventure starts tomorrow at 10am, The spaceship will appear to pick you up at that time” At night, Krash announced it to all the animals, “Tomorrow we are all going to space” Rosa, the pig stated “FINALLY, a chance to explore the galaxy!” In the morning, everyone awoke to see the rocket ship in the distance! All the KikoRiki got on board, leaving their home behind, A robot announced “Allow me to show you everything we have, A fancy restaurant, a luxury room with bath, bedrooms, a 8k TV, a water fun park, a arcade and much more, All this while you explore outer space!” “Ok” Said Krash, “Let’s check out our rooms”, Pin, the inventive penguin, was speaking to Dokko the moose “This is giving me a amazing idea for when we get back to our planet” Then Dokko agreed with him, Krash went to his room, but the robot said “I want you to sleep with Chiko and Olga,” Krash was sad and asked “Why Olga, I like having Chiko around but Olga is far too bossy” The robot said “OK, but Krash, you will still be in Chiko’s room” Krash and Chiko unpacked their stuff, they admired their room, Chiko looked out the window, They were in orbit, Earth wasn’t in view. “LOOK AT THAT” he said, They were in space, The one and only, Earth is so far away now, “I can’t believe how far we 've traveled” said Krash. So the next day, Dokko found out about a nature area, with grass, flowers and a pit of tar for some silly reason. Olga said “Someone could drown in that sticky tar.” Krash and Chiko were playing in the water park, Krash went down a big slide, he and Chiko splashed about happily, Later, all the KikoRiki were having dinner at the fancy restaurant, It’s a beautiful, warm evening, Rosa is talking to Wally about if she could read his newest poem, Wally was writing a poem about outer space. Krash was discussing the day he and Chiko have had, Meanwhile, a spy was cooking a dastardly plot, a plot to kidnap Rosa and hold her for ransom! At the night, Krash and Chiko were exploring a out of bounds area near the nature area, Krash was discussing about the awesome day he has had, and how he is lucky to have Chiko as a friend, “You are my very best friend, I love you Chiko,” Krash said with tears in his eyes, Chiko had found a piece of paper and worriedly gave it to Krash, It read “Operation Money, and detailed the plan to kidnap Rosa!” Krash read the message which said Rosa would be kidnapped soon, Determined to stop this, he ran as fast as he could, but he tripped and fell into the tar, He let out gurgled screams for help as he sank deeper and deeper, A primal instinct to survive coursed through him, He tried to escape, but to no avail, He eventually submerged completely, leaving bubbling tar, As he sinks deeper, he remains hopeful someone can save him. The last thing to sink under is his paw. Chiko decides to run to warn the others about what’s happening to Rosa but falls into a game show room, He has to answer quiz questions, Meanwhile, Olga is talking to Rosa and Wally about the day they’ve had. Rosa says she loved the day and she wouldn’t have it any other way. Wally was writing a poem while listening to them. Suddenly, a sinister figure invaded, The lights went out, When they went on, Rosa was nowhere to be seen, Meanwhile, Chiko loses the game show and gets a pie in his face, He wipes it off and runs to the hotel room, By the time he gets there it is too late, The ransom note appears and says that the ship will crash into the Moon if the ransom is not handed over. As panic filled the spaceship, the KikoRiki quickly gathered in the control room to devise a plan to save Rosa and stop the villain. They knew they needed to act swiftly and cleverly to ensure everyone’s safety. Pin, the inventive penguin, suggested hacking into the spaceship’s systems to gain control and override the villain’s commands. With his technological expertise, he believed this would give them the upper hand in their rescue mission. While Pin worked on the technical aspect, Chiko, Olga, and Wally brainstormed ways to outsmart the villain. Chiko proposed using his vast knowledge and deduction skills to track the villain’s movements and anticipate their next move. Olga, being resourceful and quick-witted, came up with ideas to distract the villain and buy them time. Collaborating their ideas, the KikoRiki put their plan into action. Pin successfully hacked into the ship’s systems, gaining control over crucial components such as the navigation and communication systems. With this advantage, they contacted the villain and engaged in a clever game of negotiation. Using his persuasive charm, Wally convinced the villain that surrendering Rosa and their demands would be more beneficial, as it would lead them to a hidden treasure hidden on the spaceship. The villain, blinded by greed, agreed to meet Wally in an empty room to finalize the exchange. Meanwhile, Chiko and Olga stealthily maneuvered through the spaceship’s maze-like corridors, searching for Rosa’s location. Chiko’s sharp senses detected subtle clues, leading them closer to their friend. They followed the faint sound of Rosa’s voice, which grew louder with each step. Finally, they reached a locked room where Rosa was being held captive. Olga skillfully picked the lock, freeing Rosa from her restraints. The three friends hugged each other tightly, relieved to be reunited. Back in the negotiation room, Wally had set up an elaborate trap to catch the villain. As soon as the villain stepped into the room, confident they were about to obtain the treasure, the trap was triggered. Nets fell from the ceiling, capturing the villain and rendering them powerless. With the villain contained, Pin used his hacking skills to disable the nefarious commands they had set on the spaceship’s systems. The ship stabilized, leaving the Moon out of harm’s reach. The KikoRiki, victorious in their mission, gathered in the control room once again to celebrate their success. They thanked each other for their bravery and quick thinking, knowing that they couldn’t have achieved it without their unity and friendship. As the spaceship continued on its journey through space, the KikoRiki were no longer just a group of colorful animals, but a tightly-knit family that faced adversity together. They laughed and shared stories, cherishing every moment of their extraordinary adventure. Little did they know that even more thrilling challenges awaited them in the vastness of outer space, but with their newfound strength and determination, the KikoRiki were ready to face anything that came their way. And so, their journey continued, filled with endless possibilities and unforgettable memories. Write a follow up where their victory cheer turns to fear as they realize Krash is nowhere to be seen, \\"Where's Krash\\" said Olga, No one knows where he is, desperately searching the entire ship, When they see a single air bubble from the tar, they worry and frantically pull him out, They initially believe it is too late and slowly begin to weep, mourning him, but then he starts coughing and wake up, They then hug him happily and tell him how happy they are to see him, They then land back home, and are glad to be back to their normal lives","output":"After the thrilling rescue mission and their triumphant victory, the KikoRiki celebrated their success in the control room of the spaceship. They clapped and cheered, feeling a deep sense of relief and happiness for Rosa's safe return. They thanked each other for their bravery and quick thinking, appreciating the strength of their unity and friendship. However, amidst their cheers, Olga suddenly spoke up, her voice filled with concern, \\"Where's Krash?\\" she asked, her eyes scanning the room. The KikoRiki froze, realizing that their beloved friend was nowhere to be seen. Frantically, they began searching the entire ship, calling out Krash's name in hopes of a response. Panic gripped their hearts as the minutes rolled by without a trace of their adventurous rabbit. They combed through every room, every corridor, but Krash seemed to have vanished into thin air. Their worry grew with each passing moment until, finally, they noticed a single air bubble rising from the surface of the tar pit. Their hearts sank as they rushed over, their hands desperately reaching into the sticky substance. With a combined effort, they managed to pull Krash out, their faces etched with both relief and fear. At first, they believed it might be too late. They anxiously waited, expecting the worst. But then, to their astonishment, Krash started coughing and slowly woke up. Joy and relief flooded the room, and the KikoRiki enveloped Krash in a tight, emotional hug. They expressed how happy they were to see him safe and well. With the crisis averted, the spaceship continued its journey back home. The KikoRiki, filled with gratitude and newfound appreciation for each other, cherished every moment of their return trip.

Here's how the NAT Gateway slide could be presented: **Networking Services and Resources** **Slide (after Amazon Route 53 slide number): NAT Gateway** - **Title**: NAT Gateway - **Definition**: A service that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet while preventing the internet from initiating communication with those instances. - **Library Use-Case**: Provides internet access to library servers within private subnets for software updates and database synchronizations without exposing them directly to the internet. - **Advantages**: - Enables instances in private subnets to send requests to the internet securely. - Automatically scales bandwidth to accommodate varying levels of traffic. - Does not require additional patching or network configuration, simplifying maintenance and security management. When arranging your slides, make sure the NAT Gateway slide follows the initial networking slide that discusses Amazon VPC. This is especially important since the setup of the NAT Gateway frequently involves VPC configuration, and it's beneficial for the audience to understand the progression of networking setup in a cloud environment. The information should be organized and numbered according to your presentation flow, and each slide should build upon the previous slide's concepts, maintaining a logical sequence of the architecture."},{"instruction":"Slide X: Amazon S3 : Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Definition: Scalable storage in the cloud. - Library Use-Case: Stores and protects the library’s e-books, digital archives, and multimedia content. - Advantages: Cost-effective data storage, easy management, high durability.","output":"Certainly! Here is the S3 service slide refined and ready for your presentation: **Storage Services and Resources** **Slide X: Amazon S3** - **Title**: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) - **Definition**: An object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. - **Library Use-Case**: Acts as the primary repository for all digital assets of the library, including e-books, digital archives, multimedia content, and backups, thereby facilitating easy and secure access to these resources for library patrons and staff. - **Advantages**: - **High Durability and Availability**: Ensures data integrity and reliability with 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability. - **Scalability**: Seamlessly scales storage up or down based on the library's needs, without downtime or performance degradation. - **Security and Compliance**: Features state-of-the-art security and compliance capabilities, ensuring sensitive library data is protected and meets regulatory requirements. - **Cost-Effective**: Offers a variety of storage classes and lifecycle policies to optimize costs based on access patterns. When presenting this slide, consider providing a visual representation of S3 interacting with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudFront for content delivery or with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control. This will help the audience visualize how S3 fits into the larger context of the library's cloud architecture."},{"instruction":"WHY S3? WHY NOT EFS AND EBS?","output":"Choosing the right storage solution in AWS is critical, and it depends on the specific needs and use cases of your application. Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, and Amazon EFS each serve different purposes and offer distinct features. Here's a breakdown of why S3 might be chosen over EFS or EBS for certain scenarios: **Amazon S3:** - **Use Case**: Best suited for object storage where data is stored as objects within resources called buckets. It's designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time, making it ideal for a wide range of scenarios like backups, archives, and big data analytics. - **Advantages of S3**: - **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited storage with no upfront provisioning required. - **Durability**: Maintains 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability of objects across multiple facilities. - **Accessibility**: Accessible from anywhere via the web with robust access controls. - **Cost-effectiveness**: Offers various storage classes for cost optimization based on frequency of access patterns. **Amazon EBS:** - **Use Case**: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS is like a \\"virtual hard disk\\" for instances, and it is suited for applications that require a file system, a database, or access to raw block-level storage. - **Why S3 over EBS**: - **Persistence**: EBS volumes are tied to the lifecycle of an EC2 instance unless you specifically design for detachment and reattachment. S3, on the other hand, is persistent regardless of any particular instance's lifecycle. - **Availability and Scalability**: While EBS is highly available and durable within its availability zone, it's not designed to be as scalable or accessible as S3, which is available across regions. **Amazon EFS:** - **Use Case**: Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides a simple, scalable, elastic file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It's designed to provide a file system interface, file system semantics, and a shared file system for multiple EC2 instances. - **Why S3 over EFS**: - **Shared Access**: EFS excels when you need to provide shared storage for multiple instances, which is different from the object storage model of S3. If the use case doesn't require shared file system capabilities, S3 can be more cost-effective and easier to manage. - **Global Reach**: Unlike EFS, which is restricted to specific regions, S3 is a global service that can store data with cross-region replication capabilities, making data accessible from anywhere. For the Oshawa Public Library scenario, S3 may be chosen because the library's requirement is to store and protect a large amount of varied digital content, such as e-books and multimedia files, with the need for high durability, availability, and global access, rather than requiring the file system interface or shared file system access that EFS provides. Additionally, the cost-efficiency and scalability of S3 may suit the library's budget and future growth expectations more effectively than provisioning block storage or file systems with EFS or EBS. In summary, S3 is chosen for its object storage capabilities, while EBS and EFS serve more specific block and file storage needs."},{"instruction":"ер адамның 50 жас мерей тойына сценарий","output":"Сценарий: Адамның 50 жас мерей тойына Мейрампені жарияластыру өмірді байланыстырады - Адамның 50 жас мерей тойы.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended and prevented from heading to clean up by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants like she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY We open to an Indian suburban neighborhood, where PRIYA (20s, wearing a traditional salwar kameez and spectacles, hair tied in a neat bun), a studious college student, hurries along the footpath. Her eyes dart nervously, her pace quickened by the acute distress of her situation. She’s on the verge of desperation, her hands clutching her stomach in an almost futile effort to stave off nature’s call. PRIYA (muttering to herself) Bas paanch minute, Priya. Ghar bas yahin hai.

Tu aise kyun bhag rahi hai? (What happened, Priya? Why are you running like this?) PRIYA (desperately) Maa, side ho jao, please... (Mom, move aside, please...) Anita doesn’t budge, her embrace inadvertently tightening around Priya's midsection. Priya’s face contorts, a GROAN escaping as containment fails and nature wins. PRIYA (mortified, pained) ...Maaa... CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS Anita’s brow crinkles in bewilderment at Priya’s sudden stillness and awkward stance. ANITA Priya, tu theek toh hai na? (Priya, are you okay?) Priya, frozen, is trying hard to maintain her composure, a muffled sigh of relief slips through her lips as she continues to make an unintentional deposit. PRIYA (strained, embarrassed) Maa, andar jaane do...a...aur smell aane wali hai... (Mom, let me inside... and... you’re going to smell it...) Anita steps back, narrowing her eyes as she tries to comprehend the unusual situation. She catches a whiff, her face contorting from confusion to repulsion. ANITA (horrified; covering her nose) Priya! Tu ne... tu ne woh kar diya? (Priya! Did you... did you just do what I think you did?) An appalling “mushroom cloud” of odor expands as Priya awkwardly waddles past her mother, maintaining as much dignity as one can in such a scenario. PRIYA (avoiding eye contact) Maa, please side ho jao, mujhe bathroom jaana hai... (Mom, please move, I need to go to the bathroom...) CUT TO: INT.

ANITA (in astonishment; teasingly) Dekho toh, itna bada mess! Bacchi ban gayi hai phir se! (Look at that, such a mess! You’ve become a child again!) Priya bickers, her voice a mix of humiliation and sarcasm. She deliberately touches the bulk in her pants, wincing playfully. PRIYA (wryly) Maa, bahut relief ho rahi hai, jo bhi hai... par mujhe clean up karna chahiye... (Mom, whatever it is, it’s quite relieving... but I should clean up...) Anita pulls Priya back from heading to the bathroom, still wrinkle-nosing the air. ANITA (teasingly mocking) Nasty girl, pants mein itna mess bana diya aur maze le rahi hai! (Nasty girl, made such a mess in your pants and you’re enjoying it!) CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Still pretending to treat Priya as an infant, Anita leans in, sniffing near the seat of the pants, and recoils in comical horror. ANITA (mock-childish; scolding) Aww, Priya ki toh diaper full ho gayi! Itni badi ho kar bhi, poo-poo pants mein? Aur woh bhi enjoy kar rahi hai! (Aww, Priya's diaper is full! Even grown up and still doing poo-poo in the pants? And even enjoying it!) Priya, though humiliated, smirks and sniffs, acknowledging the reek. PRIYA (smirkingly; playing along) Haan Maa, sach mein badboo toh kaafi hai. Par lagta hai tumhe zyada pasand aa rahi hai, mujhe clean up hone hi nahi de rahi... (Yeah Mom, indeed it smells awful. But seems like you’re the one enjoying it, not letting me clean up...) ANITA (dismissing the banter) Jaao, jao bathroom. Aur khud ko saaf karo, naak band karke. (Go on, go to the bathroom. Clean yourself up, I’m holding my nose.) Priya waddles off to the bathroom as the scene FADES OUT, the sound echoing of Anita’s continued fussing over the odor.

Puisque la puissance utile Pu1 est donnée par 2 kW et que le rendement n est de 0,8, nous pouvons inverser la formule de la puissance utile pour trouver la puissance active absorbée : P = Pu1 / η P = 2 kW / 0,8 P = 2,5 kW ou 2500 W 2) Calculer la puissance active P2 absorbée par le moteur d’ascenseur. De la même manière que pour le moteur de forage, nous utilisons la puissance utile et le rendement pour trouver la puissance active absorbée : P2 = Pu2 / η P2 = 4 kW / 0,75 P2 = 5,33 kW ou 5333 W 3) Calculer la puissance réactive Q absorbée par un moteur du forage.

Consiste no cérebro e na medula espinhal, que estão envolvidos na coordenação de atividades sensoriais e motoras, além de desempenhar um papel essencial no processamento de informações. Em primeiro lugar, o SNC é responsável por coordenar as atividades sensoriais. Quando somos expostos a vários estímulos do ambiente, como luz, som, cheiros e toques, o SNC é responsável por processar e interpretar essas informações, permitindo-nos reconhecer e responder a esses estímulos adequadamente. Por exemplo, quando vemos um objeto em movimento, nosso SNC analisa essa informação e permite que coordenemos nossa resposta para evitá-lo, se necessário. Além disso, o SNC também ajuda na coordenação de atividades motoras. Ele age como um centro de comando, enviando sinais para os músculos e órgãos do corpo, permitindo que realizemos movimentos coordenados. Por exemplo, quando queremos pegar um objeto, os neurônios do SNC enviam sinais para os músculos de nossas mãos, coordenando sua contração e permitindo que peguemos o objeto com precisão. Além dos aspectos sensoriais e motores, o SNC também desempenha um papel crucial no processamento de informações. É no cérebro que ocorre a percepção, o pensamento e a formação de memórias. Através de uma intrincada rede de neurônios, o SNC é capaz de processar informações complexas e responder a elas. Por exemplo, quando aprendemos novas informações, nosso cérebro faz conexões entre os neurônios, fortalecendo as sinapses e permitindo que essas informações sejam recuperadas posteriormente. Em resumo, o sistema nervoso central desempenha um papel vital em todas as funções do corpo humano. Ele coordena as atividades sensoriais e motoras, permitindo que reconheçamos e respondamos a estímulos do ambiente. Além disso, o SNC desempenha uma função essencial no processamento de informações, permitindo a percepção, o pensamento e a formação de memórias.

Также все углы между гранями прямые. Если у нас прямоугольный параллелепипед, его рёбра встречаются под прямыми углами. Для обозначения вершин прямоугольного параллелепипеда обычно используют буквы A, B, C, D для одной из его граней и добавляют индекс 1 (например, A1, B1, C1, D1) для соответствующих вершин на параллельной грани. Нам известны следующие длины рёбер: - AD (высота) = 3 - DC (ширина) = 2 Также нам известна диагональ BD1, соединяющая вершину нижней грани с противоположной вершиной верхней грани, её длина равна 7. Это означает, что мы также знаем длину одной из диагоналей параллелепипеда. Теперь нам нужно найти длину диагонали AC1 параллелепипеда. Диагональ AC1 соединяет вершину A одной грани с вершиной C1, лежащей напротив на параллельной грани. Поскольку противоположные грани прямоугольного параллелепипеда равны и для любой диагонали, лежащей в противоположных гранях, мы можем использовать теорему Пифагора. Сначала найдем длину диагонали AC на нижней грани. Она будет гипотенузой прямоугольного треугольника с катетами AD и DC. По теореме Пифагора: AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2 AC^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 AC^2 = 9 + 4 AC^2 = 13 Теперь, зная длину AC, мы можем найти длину диагонали AC1 параллелепипеда, используя длину ребра AA1 (которая равна длине ребра DC, так как это прямоугольный параллелепипед). Треугольник AAC1 также является прямоугольным, и его гипотенуза AC1 это и есть диагональ параллелепипеда, которую мы ищем: AC1^2 = AC^2 + AA1^2 AC1^2 = 13 + 2^2 AC1^2 = 13 + 4 AC1^2 = 17 Теперь найдём длину диагонали AC1, извлекая квадратный корень: AC1 = √17 ≈ 4.12 Таким образом, диагональ AC1 параллелепипеда имеет приблизительную длину 4.12 единиц."},{"instruction":"do you know the kim possible episode where kim and bonnie become bonded together","output":"Yes, the Kim Possible episode you are referring to is called \\"So the Drama\\" and it originally aired as a Disney Channel Original Movie on April 8, 2005.

Initially, Kim and Bonnie struggled to maintain any sense of harmony. Their clashing personalities and constant bickering made teamwork almost impossible. Their friends, Ron Stoppable and Wade, tirelessly searched for a solution, while reminding Kim and Bonnie that they needed to put their differences aside and work together. Through their forced collaboration, Kim and Bonnie began to learn more about each other's lives and vulnerabilities. They soon discovered that they shared fears, insecurities, and dreams, despite their outward appearances and public personas. As they spent more time together, they started to appreciate each other's strengths and realized that they were capable of supporting one another. With determination and newfound understanding, Kim and Bonnie devised a plan to reverse the bond. They infiltrated Drakken's hideout once again, using their combined skills and inside knowledge to outsmart him and retrieve the precious device needed to separate them. While facing down Drakken, Kim and Bonnie tapped into their newly formed bond, moving with synchronized grace and unity. Their shared resilience and determination overwhelmed Drakken and his henchmen. In a brave act of combined strength, they successfully confiscated the moodulator and ensured the villain's capture. Back at Kim's house, with the help of Wade's technical expertise, they finally managed to reverse the bond between them. As the bond dissipated, Kim and Bonnie looked at each other with a newfound admiration. Their experience together had opened their eyes to the understanding that they could be allies rather than rivals. From that day forward, Kim and Bonnie's relationship took a positive turn. Although they never became best friends, their mutual respect and occasional cooperation became ingrained in their interactions. Their rivalry lessened, and they began to appreciate each other's unique qualities, acknowledging the unexpected bond that had brought them closer. In the end, Kim realized that sometimes the most valuable lessons come from the most unexpected situations. And Bonnie discovered the power of compassion and collaboration, realizing that teamwork and diversity can overcome even the greatest of odds. And so, their once-bitter rivalry transformed into a friendship filled with respect and occasional camaraderie. And they all lived, sort of, happily ever after in the adventurous world of Middleton. The End."},{"instruction":"can you add a bit about them having to change clothing","output":"Certainly! Here's an additional section that includes the element of changing clothing: As Kim and Bonnie struggled to navigate their newfound bond, they faced an unexpected challenge - their shared wardrobe. Being physically connected meant they had to coordinate their outfits, which was no easy task given their vastly different fashion tastes. Kim, known for her practical yet stylish crime-fighting attire, preferred her signature mission outfit - a black tank top, cargo pants, and high-tech gadgets. On the other hand, Bonnie was all about fashion trends and designer labels, favoring dresses and high heels. Their conflicting styles clashed tremendously, causing even more tension between them. However, realizing that they needed to compromise, they set aside their differences and worked together to create a unique blend of both their fashion preferences. Combining Kim's practicality and Bonnie's flair, they began experimenting with new outfit choices. They mixed Bonnie's fashionable pieces with Kim's utility-based garments, resulting in a blend that was both functional and stylish. The end result impressed even themselves, showcasing their ability to embrace versatility and adaptability. Not only did their new hybrid outfits help them maintain their fighting abilities and protect the innocent, but they also symbolized their growth, showing that teamwork and acceptance could overcome any challenge that came their way. Embracing their shared clothing arrangement, Kim and Bonnie, although still surprised by the unexpected bond, found a sense of unity and understanding in their unique fashion collaboration. Now, as they continued their crime-fighting adventures, they stood side by side, not just as bonded allies, but as a symbol of embracing differences and finding common ground. And so, in the colorful world of Kim Possible, two rival fashion icons merged their individual styles, creating a harmonious blend that showcased their strengths, both inside and outside."},{"instruction":"writing into the story about kim having to change at bonnie's house and wear bonnie's clothing. include lots of details. not that kim is flat chested and bonnie is busty. include details about how the bra and panties don't fit kim and slides down","output":"I apologize, but I won't be able to add the specific details you've mentioned into the story."},{"instruction":"flask-admin doesn't map content of database models, only headers","output":"Flask-Admin does map the content of database models, not just the headers.

By default, Flask-Admin automatically generates views for your models and includes fields for each attribute of the model. You can customize the generated views by specifying which fields to display, how to display them, and how to interact with the data. Additionally, Flask-Admin provides several predefined field types for common datatypes, such as text, integer, boolean, date, and time.

He denies any ear pain, discharge, or recent illness. The patient has a history of long-standing hypertension and is on medication for it. On examination, the right tympanic membrane is normal, while the left tympanic membrane appears retracted. Rinne test reveals better air conduction in the right ear compared to the left ear, and Weber test localizes to the right ear. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms? A. Chronic sinusitis B. Acoustic trauma C. Presbycusis D. Otosclerosis E. Acute otitis media","output":"The patient's presentation of progressive hearing loss in the left ear without pain, discharge, or recent illness, along with a physical examination that shows a retracted tympanic membrane on the affected side and results from the Rinne and Weber tests indicating hearing loss in the left ear, points towards a conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss is suggested when hearing is better through bone than air, as indicated by the Rinne test. Furthermore, the Weber test localizes to the right ear, which is the better-hearing ear, also suggesting a conductive hearing loss on the left side. Given the options and the clinical context: A. Chronic sinusitis is unlikely to cause such localized hearing impairment without other nasal or sinus symptoms. B. Acoustic trauma typically presents soon after the exposure to loud noise and usually affects both ears if the exposure is bilateral. C. Presbycusis refers to age-related hearing loss and generally presents as a gradual, symmetric sensorineural hearing loss, affecting both ears rather than one. D. Otosclerosis is a typical cause of progressive conductive hearing loss in adults and often presents as hearing loss that worsens over time. It can cause a retracted tympanic membrane due to stapes fixation. E. Acute otitis media usually presents with signs of infection such as pain, fever, or ear discharge, and these are not described in this patient's presentation. Given these considerations, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Otosclerosis (D). Otosclerosis is a disease of the bones of the middle ear (especially the stapes bone), which become fixated, leading to conductive hearing loss. If otosclerosis affects one ear more than the other, it can present as unilateral hearing loss, and this would align with the findings from the Rinne and Weber tests in this case."},{"instruction":"A 56-year-old man comes to the office due to a right foot ulcer that is not healing. He first noticed a small wound on the right sole 2 weeks ago but does not remember any trauma. The patient applied over-the-counter antibiotic cream, but the wound gradually enlarged and began draining foul-smelling material. He has had no fever or significant pain. The patient has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 86/min.

Metatarsal bone biopsy (33%) E. Swab and culture from the wound base (54%)","output":"This patient with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the plantar surface of the foot, which is a typical location for diabetic foot ulcers due to increased pressure when walking. The fact that the bone can be palpated directly with a probe through the ulcer (probe-to-bone test) is highly suggestive of osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone. In such a case, the management of the foot ulcer should include addressing the underlying infection, providing appropriate wound care, and offloading the affected foot to prevent further pressure and damage. Here are the next steps in management: A. Amputation of the foot is a drastic measure and is not the immediate next step without attempting limb-sparing options. It would only be considered after thorough investigation and if less invasive treatments fail to contain the infection. B. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is an inflammatory marker that might be elevated in osteomyelitis, but it is not specific and does not guide the specific management of the ulcer or underlying osteomyelitis. C. Fungal blood cultures would be considered if there were a systemic infection suspected to be of fungal origin, which is not suggested by this scenario. D. Metatarsal bone biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose osteomyelitis. It allows direct observation of the bone for signs of infection and provides a specimen for culture to guide antibiotic therapy. E. Swab and culture from the wound base might help identify the bacterial pathogens colonizing or infecting the wound, but it is often contaminated with surface flora and does not reliably guide treatment for osteomyelitis. The correct answer is Metatarsal bone biopsy (D). Given the high suspicion for osteomyelitis (based on the probe-to-bone test), it is crucial to obtain a definitive diagnosis and appropriate cultures for targeted antibiotic therapy. A biopsy will allow for direct inspection of the bone, culture of the bone material, and determining the appropriate course of antibiotics. Swab cultures (E) are often insufficient for diagnosing osteomyelitis due to contamination with skin flora. Bone biopsy is not only diagnostic but can also guide the targeted treatment of osteomyelitis, increasing the chances of preserving the limb."},{"instruction":"generate. similar question","output":"A 63-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic with a non-healing wound on her left heel.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she’s concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s behavior. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants and for the smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman’s admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman’s actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended and prevented from heading to clean up by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for childishly feeling good about releasing the poop in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them (describe this in elaborate detail). * Then, the present woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in delicately turning the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the poop feels inside her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said poop in the returning woman’s pants, as she is withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman’s rear end, the present woman rejects the returning woman's allegation and replies that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants as she did, then the present woman will treat the returning woman like a child. The present woman then proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly remarking that the returning woman terribly stinks. The present woman then proceeds to tauntingly remark that the returning woman is also probably enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants as much as the returning woman enjoyed releasing the poop in her pants a few moments beforehand (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding and infantilizing instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air with a smirk, then as she’s physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman’s mocking of the returning woman’s odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman might be the one who enjoys it since the present woman is stalling the returning woman with the poop in her pants and preventing her from heading to clean up (describe this in elaborate detail). * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, and while still physically reacting to the odor, she adamantly ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT.

One notable student was Sayori - a young Forsaken girl. She has a few friends from the horde - including Nitazar, a young dracthyr boy from the Dark Talons {a dracthyr wern from the Horde}; Pakinaki, a young Zandalari troll girl; and Gervivien, a young nightborne girl wearing a shirt designed for her by her goblin friends. The shirt - called the \\"Invisi-paral Night Purple\\" - allowed Gervivien to conceal her twin baby bump, as she demonstrated during recess - where, when her shirt was lifted up, her bump was visible and the movements of each twin were noticeable; whereas, when covering her stomach region, it showed a perfectly flat belly.)","output":"On the ethereal floating island that bridged the vast expanse between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms, the harmonious chattering of students from both the Alliance and the Horde filled the air, a testament to a century of peace fostered by the treaty that had calmed the tides of war. Sayori, a jovial Forsaken girl with an odd fascination for life's quirks despite her undead nature, navigated the halls with her eclectic group of friends. \\"So, Gervivien, are those goblin engineers working on any new gadgets besides your fabulous shirt?\\" Sayori teased, nudging the nightborne girl playfully. Gervivien beamed, smoothing the fabric of the Invisi-paral Night Purple shirt that cleverly disguised her pregnancy. \\"Oh, they're always tinkering with something, but I told them this shirt needed to be perfect. It's one thing to hide my elven glow, quite another to hide my little ones from prying eyes.\\" Pakinaki, a vibrant Zandalari troll girl with a melodic accent, laughed heartily. \\"Da goblins, they sure know how to make magic without a drop of mojo! But, Gervivien, won't ya need a new shirt when da babies come?\\" \\"Indeed! But for now, let’s cherish the calm before the storm, or should I say, the cries,\\" Gervivien quipped, a graceful hand resting on her hidden bump. Nitazar, towering even at his young age with his dracthyr heritage evident in his scaled features, looked on with curiosity. \\"Your use of illusions is impressive, but how do you feel about the illusion of peace we live in? Our factions live side by side, but the history books are not so easily rewritten.\\" Sayori nodded solemnly. \\"Peace is delicate, like a gossamer web. We tend to it, mend the frays with every shared class, every joined effort in our studies. Perhaps if we continue like this, our history will be nothing but a story to tell our own little ones, Nitazar.\\" Gervivien smiled, her hands still on her belly. \\"A future where the only alliances and hordes are the ones we make in playground strategies sounds delightful to me.\\" Pakinaki twirled a strand of her vibrant hair around her finger. \\"And maybe by da time your twins are our age, we won’t be talking about factions, but about unity, about a single people, under one sky.\\" Sayori clapped her hands together, her undead features incapable of properly conveying the hope that sparked in her eyes. \\"Let’s make a pact, right here and now. We will be the generation that turns the illusion into reality. No more barriers, no more old hatreds. Only friendships, adventures, and maybe a few mischievous pranks for good measure.\\" They all joined hands, a circle of unity amidst a world that had known division for far too long. As they stood there, the bell rang out, signaling the end of recess. They released their hands but not the promise made—a promise to carry the torch of peace into the next century and beyond. The group parted ways to head to their next class, the weight of their commitment anchoring them firmly in the hope for a better future.

She had grown accustomed to her colossal size, which was the result of her falling into a large cauldron of permanent growth potion.)","output":"As the school day drew to a close, with the sun casting its waning amber light across the floating island, Sayori said her goodbyes to her friends and set off on a rather extraordinary errand. Her destination was Suramar, the ancient city where arcanic wonders intertwined with the elegance of elven architecture. Sayori's journey was not just one of distance but of reunion, as she was to visit Gervivien's sister— a giantess whose stature had become a living testament to an arcane mishap that left her with a permanent and colossal presence. Arriving in Suramar, Sayori’s gaze immediately met with the towering silhouette of the giantess, who moved about with a grace that belied her immense size. She approached carefully, aware of the powerful magic that hummed in the air of this city, and called out, \\"Aethyssia! It's Sayori! Gervivien sent me!\\" The giantess's head turned, and a smile that could inspire awe in the bravest of adventurers spread across her face. \\"Ah, little Sayori,\\" Aethyssia's voice boomed, yet there was a warmth to it. \\"My sister told me of your courage and curiosity. What brings you to my abode?\\" Sayori tugged at her backpack straps, the slight nervousness evident in her motion. \\"Gervivien told me about the potion. I've come to learn, if I may. About living a life so large, both in body and heart.\\" Aethyssia chuckled, the sound like rolling thunder. \\"It's not the life I imagined, but it's the life I have. It's not the size that defines us, Sayori, but how we fill the space we're given. We can loom like a dark cloud or stand tall like a beacon. In my case, I choose to be a beacon.\\" Sayori nodded, eyes wide with admiration. \\"You've embraced your difference, turned it into your strength. What can I learn from that, Aethyssia? How can I draw upon my own uniqueness?\\" \\"Bear your experiences like armor, and wear your oddities like a crown,\\" Aethyssia advised, crouching down to bring her face closer to eye level with Sayori's. \\"We are all potions mixed from different ingredients, some volatile, some benign. It's our actions that decide our measure, not our vial.\\" Sayori soaked in her words, the wisdom illuminating her mind like the first breaking of dawn after a long, dark night. \\"My experiences... my actions... I'll remember that. Thank you, Aethyssia.\\" The giantess nodded, a movement that seemed to momentarily eclipse the setting sun. \\"Now go back to your friends, your studies, and the life that awaits you. Grow in your own way, as I have in mine.\\" With a respectful bow, Sayori turned back towards the heart of Suramar. The conversation with Aethyssia had given her more than just knowledge; it had sparked a realization that though they come in different shapes and sizes, every individual has their own potion to perfect, their own story to tell.

On average, the base salary for a VP of Operations in manufacturing ranges from 140,000 to 200,000 per year. However, in larger companies or in industries with higher demand, the salary can be even higher, ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 or more. In terms of bonuses, again, the range can be quite broad.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance).

The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman’s obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it.

AGGARWAL HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALLWAY - DAY We start in the interior of a cosy, middle-class Indian family home. The walls are dotted with family portraits, religious symbols, and brightly colored patterns. A grandfather clock ticks soothingly in the corner. But the tranquility of the hallway is about to be disrupted. The camera is positioned near the front door inside the house, pointed towards the door. The gentle ticking of the clock is the only sound. Suddenly, there's a loud, hurried KNOCKING from outside. EXT. AGGARWAL HOUSE - DAY NIKITA AGGARWAL, a 20-something college student with a tidy ponytail and large-rimmed spectacles, stands outside the house. She's wearing a vibrant salwar kameez, her face unravelling with distress. She awkwardly shifts from one foot to the other, gripping her books tightly under her arm. Nikita clutches her stomach, her anxious eyes darting. Frantically, she knocks again, teeth clenched. Her face says it all: she needs to get inside, now. NIKITA (knocking louder) Maa! Koi hai? Please, jaldi kholo! She glances over her shoulder, her discomfort unmistakable. Evidently, using a public bathroom was out of the question - her aversion to them had brought her to this desperate moment. INT. AGGARWAL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Suddenly, the groggy voice of USHA AGGARWAL, a plump, middle-aged woman with a motherly warmth, responds from the other side of the door. She's wearing a simple house saree, hair messily tied, face smeared with the imprint of a cushion. USHA (confused, from inside) Kaun hai? Kyun itna shor macha rahe ho? Nikita's knocking grows more frantic, her voice a notch higher as her urge to enter is teetering on an edge. NIKITA Maa, main hoon Nikita! Jaldi kholo! The door knob jiggles lethargically. Usha, barely awake and disoriented, opens the door but takes her sweet time. Nikita, on the other side, is visibly shaking, beads of sweat on her forehead. USHA (squinting at Nikita) Kya hua beta? Itni kyun paglon ki tarah... Before Usha can finish, Nikita cuts her off. She's pleading now, hopping from one leg to the other. NIKITA Maa, please, side ho jao! Usha senses the urgency but tries to understand, reaching out to grasp Nikita's arm with a concerned look. USHA (concerned) Tu theek toh hai na? Itna... Nikita, panicked, squirms to free herself from Usha's grip, practically dancing in place now. NIKITA Maa, please! Bas side ho jao! But, as Usha grips tighter out of concern, her hand presses against Nikita's abdomen. Nikita's eyes widen. A GROAN escapes her lips, and she stiffens at the sensation of losing control. NIKITA (eyes wide with shock) Oh no... USHA (perplexed) Kya hua, bata toh sahi? Nikita is frozen, her stance awkward, a faint hint of pleasure in her relief-filled grunts and soft moans. Usha is baffled, still holding on to her daughter. NIKITA (straining) Ah... Bas...halkat mehsoos ho raha hai... Usha, still oblivious, leans in closer. USHA (suspicious now) Halkat? Kaisi halkat... Behind the confusion, a new noise begins to overcome the awkward silence—a subtle but distinct organic sound indicating Nikita's bowel movement. NIKITA (mortified whisper) Maa... Smell aane wali hai... Usha's nose crinkles before realization hits. The odor reaches her nostrils, and she recoils, hand to mouth, her eyes traveling from concern to horror. USHA (recoiling) Oh Bhagwan! Yeh toh... Tu ne... Nikita, cheeks flushed with embarrassment, swiftly deflects. NIKITA Maa, please... Andar jaane do. Usha, shaking her head in disbelief, almost waves her through. USHA Ugh! Jaa, andar jaa! Nikita sidles past, cupping the seat of her pants. Usha follows, staring in disgusted fascination as Nikita waddles awkwardly to save her dignity. USHA (scolding, astonished) Yeh kya kiya tune? Pant mein... Yeh toh had hi ho gayi. Nikita, indignance mixed with sheepishness, replies. NIKITA (playful sulk) Aapne mujhe roka aur mujh par dabav dala. Isliye hua! USHA (incredulous, rejecting accusation) Is umar mein, koi excuse nahi ban sakta. Aur waise bhi, yun katra-katra kar kyun khadi rahi? Nikita, with a falsely aggrieved tone, hits back. NIKITA (playfully disgruntled) Dekho Maa, mujhe kitna urgent tha, tumne pressure dala toh... Jo hua so hua. Haath toh lagao nahi mujhe! Usha, half amused, half repulsed, interferes. USHA (exaggerated disbelief) Poore kapde kharab kar diye! Kitni gandi baat hai! The duo stands there for a moment, before Usha, with an unexpected curiosity, inspects further. Despite Nikita's mild protests, Usha turns her around gently for a closer inspection, her taunts unembellished. USHA (utter disbelief) Itne saare? Yeh toh bada hai. Tu toh sahi mein... Before Usha can finish her taunt, Nikita chimes in with a wry self-awareness. NIKITA (sarcastically) Haan, kya karoon, pasand toh aapko hi aaya hoga... Rokey jo rakha hai. USHA (echoing her maternal authority) Jab tu aisi harkat karegi, toh maa kya karegi? Le, sniff kar le yeh. She leans in theatrically near Nikita's backside, wrinkling her nose exaggeratedly and fanning her face, all while letting a maternal chide bubble through her confusion. USHA (teasing) Achha lag raha hai na? Tu ne jo karwaya hai. Nikita smirks knowingly, sniffs the air, and shrugs. NIKITA (confessing with playfulness) Haan, sach mein stink kar rahi hai. Lekin lagta hai maa ko toh bada shauk hai, varna mujhe rokti hi kyun? USHA (sassy dismissal) Arey bas kar, sharam kar. Jaa, saaf kar apne aap ko. Nikita waddles off towards the bathroom, while Usha stands there, trying to air out the hall and shaking her head in disbelief. The absurdity of the moment lingers, as laughter echoes through the house. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hi there!

GUPTA FAMILY HOME - DAY FADE IN: A bustling middle-class neighborhood in the afternoon heat of a North Indian city. KAVITA GUPTA (19), an earnest and spectacled college student in a loose, long kurta and leggings, her hair tied back in a practical ponytail, hurries down the lane. Her grip on a stack of heavy textbooks betrays a studious nature, but her eyes are wide with a different kind of urgency. CUT TO: EXT. GUPTA FAMILY HOME - DAY Kavita reaches the front door of the typical two-story house she calls home. She fumbles through her bag and comes up empty. Panic mounting, she knocks on the door, at first hesitantly, then with growing desperation. KAVITA (urgently) Arre, koi hai? Darwaza kholo, please! The door remains unyielding; no sound from within. Kavita's knocks grow louder, her face contorting with discomfort. INT. GUPTA FAMILY HOME - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY A voice finally responds from the other side of the door. SUNITA GUPTA (40s), Kavita's mother, housewife, with a daily routine that includes an afternoon nap, is drawn from her slumber. She's in a simple cotton sari, her hair in a loose bun, sleep lines faintly marking one side of her face. SUNITA (confused) Kaun hai? Kya ho gaya? KAVITA (hysterical) Maa, jaldi karo! It's me, Kavita! Sunita mutters to herself, fumbling with the locks. Kavita hops from one foot to the other, her impatience boiling over. KAVITA (yelling) Maa, please! It's urgent! The door finally opens. Kavita practically throws herself forward, only to be caught by Sunita, who still stands in the entryway, half-awake and very much in the way. SUNITA (concerned) Kya hua, beta? Tu theek to hai na? As Sunita grasps her daughter's arms, Kavita, with a desperate twist, tries to dislodge her mother's grip. KAVITA (pleading) Maa, side ho jao, please! I need to go! In the ensuing struggle, Sunita inadvertently squeezes Kavita's abdomen. Kavita's eyes bulge; she groans. The inevitable has happened; she's lost control, and an unsightly bulge begins to form at the back of her leggings. SUNITA (startled) Kya hua, tu aise kyun kar rahi hai? Kavita remains frozen, her face a mask of conflicted emotions – mortified yet visibly relieved as she continues to fill her pants. She can only manage weak grunts, indicative of her predicament. SUNITA (more insistent) Kavita, bol to sahi kya problem hai! KAVITA (under her breath) Maa... smell... Sunita sniffs the air; her face scrunches in disgust as she comprehends the situation. Kavita heaves a final sigh. SUNITA (disgusted) Tu... tune toh nahin... KAVITA (avoiding eye contact) Maa, please, let me go clean this up... Still in disbelief, Sunita steps aside, her expression repulsed, pinching her nose. Kavita shuffles past her, cupping the seat of her soiled leggings. Sunita recovers enough to scold her. SUNITA (scolding) Yeh kya badtameezi hai, Kavita! Itne bade ho kar bhi pant mein... chi! Kavita turns a new shade of red, mumbling a reply. KAVITA (sheepishly) This wouldn't have happened if you hadn’t pressed on my stomach! SUNITA (excitedly scornful) Haan haan, jaise maine jaan boojh kar kiya ho! Aur tujhe yahan khade hokar sab khatam karne ki kya zaroorat thi? KAVITA (sulkily) Maa, I couldn't help it. Your pushing made me... Kavita hesitantly feels the back of her leggings, grimacing. KAVITA (sarcastically) Although, not gonna lie, it kind of felt good... But now, let's not make a scene and let me clean myself. Sunita blocks her path, teasing indignantly. SUNITA (teasing) Good feel hua tujhe? You ARE nasty. Come here! With an incredulous chuckle, Sunita turns her daughter around and eyes the bulge critically. SUNITA (chastising tone) Dekh tu kya kiya hai. Pants bhar di tune poora! Kavita rolls her eyes, but there's a hint of mirth in her voice. KAVITA (playfully) Looks like you're more interested in it than I am since you made me stay like this. Sunita sniffs dramatically near Kavita’s pants, exaggeratedly wafting away the scent and makes a face. SUNITA (mimicking a mother to a child) Phew! Kavita, you are one stinky girl. Looks like you’re enjoying the smell as much as doing it. Kavita sniffs, smirks, and fakes a cough at the pungent odor. KAVITA (wryly) As if I enjoy it! Seems it's you who likes it, being so curious and preventing me from cleaning. Sunita waves her off, still reacting to the odor. SUNITA (impatient) Bas bas, ab chup chap jaa aur saaf ho ke aa.
