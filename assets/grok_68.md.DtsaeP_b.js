Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online. When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own. How a Proxy Works Because a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge Benefits of a Proxy Server Enhanced security: Can act like a firewall between your systems and the internet. Without them, hackers have easy access to your IP address, which they can use to infiltrate your computer or network. Private browsing, watching, listening, and shopping: Use different proxies to help you avoid getting inundated with unwanted ads or the collection of IP-specific data. Access to location-specific content: You can designate a proxy server with an address associated with another country. You can, in effect, make it look like you are in that country and gain full access to all the content computers in that country are allowed to interact with."},{"instruction":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","output":"MacArthur's Park"},{"instruction":"am the owner of an adult website called https://matureanallovers.com.

Lolita - Vladimir Nobokov: “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul”. 1984 - George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen”. Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen: “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife”. But the most memorable opening lines, which is my all-time favorite is: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: \\" It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity; it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair; we had everything before us, we had nothing before us; we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.\\""},{"instruction":"Can you describe your wholeday routine at an IIT/NIT?","output":"I'm a freshman at NIT Trichy, and my typical day during the week goes something like this. I should ideally wake up at around 5:45 am in the morning but I snooze my alarm until it’s 6:00 am. By this time, the iconic clock tower announces, quite loudly, “NIT - the pride of India, vande mataram. The time is: six o'clock.” This is followed by six chimes and effectively acts as my alarm everyday. (that's the culprit) Shortly after this I finish off whatever I have to finish every morning, relishing the only time Trichy as a city is bearably cool. Once I'm done with everything, which is by around 7:00 am, I laze around in bed on my phone catching up on the day’s news and checking the forecast (in vain) for some rain. By 7:45 am, I change into something more ‘appropriate’ for class and head downstairs to the mess for breakfast. At breakfast, I avoid the bread because for some reason it vaguely tastes like coconut. I eat the rubbery dosa, or the bland, uncooked poha or whatever there is because apparently breakfast is the most important meal of the day and I don't exactly have any other choice. Then I quickly drink tea and rush out of the mess by 8:15 am. From the mess it's directly off to the LHC (Lecture Hall Complex) which I reach by 8:20 am, since it's barely a five minute walk from the mess. I go early because I get to relish the AC in the classroom. We have our lectures from 8:30 am to 12:10 pm, with a 20-minute short break after the first two classes. This is the point where we wonder why we chose this life in the first place, and why we have to learn the basics of all the engineering disciplines when we've already chosen one as our branch. From 12:10 pm to 1:30 pm, it's our official lunch break. I prefer going to the mess and getting done with the meal as soon as I can (it's more of a chore than something I look forward to) before going to my room to relax until 1:20 pm or so. Then I rush to the LHC if there's a theory class, or go to Ojas (the Sciences block) for labs, cursing myself for not getting a cycle. Labs are quite variable and can end anywhere between 3:00–5:00 pm. After that, I go to the mess for snacks, if decent (a samosa or a cutlet, maybe) or back to my room. From 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm I usually watch a show on Prime Video, and around 6:30 pm I start to try to finish my work for the day, like records, assignments, or suggested reading. Then, around 7:30 pm, I go downstairs to either the mess or A2C (an extremely cheap restaurant) for dinner. I'm usually back to my room by 9:00 pm after giving biometric attendance. If I have a dreaded Cycle Test the next day, this is when I resort to reading textbooks or watching YouTube tutorials, and if I'm free, I continue to watch shows on Prime till around 12:00 am. I end up doing the latter even if there's a CT, and I'm racked with guilt, so to cope, I watch another episode. It's a nice, vicious cycle. I sleep by 12:30 am maximum on weekdays. I haven't mentioned the occasional classes being cancelled, Maggi at Aavin/Bru, sessions of soda at the Coke Station, long hours staring at the screen fooling myself that I'm being productive at the 24x7 Octagon Computer Center, and the sheer amount of non-academic activities on campus (clubs, symposiums) that break the monotony. Not to mention the fests like Festember, Aaveg and Pragyan that make enduring the academics worth it (very often looked forward to just for the food). (yeah, I just stole those from my Instagram) All in all, a typical day at NITT for a freshman is packed, and yet most of us manage to find time to be unproductive despite it."},{"instruction":"Does ethical obligation go beyond standard ethical conduct?","output":"First of all, an obligation is another word for a contract. If you have a contract you must do it because you agreed to. Standard means whatever the majority has decided is the normal thing to do, and ethical conduct is an agreed upon set of rules everyone chooses to follow. Therefor, whatever is obligated goes WAY BEYOND whatever is standard. This means everything and not just ethics. Ethics are a set of agreed upon rules that everyone chooses to follow in order to keep the peace in any group (family, society, work, gathering, etc.). Sort of like going to a family reunion where no one gets along. Everyone agrees to be on their best behavior even though they would rather torment each other. Following some basic ethics (keep your bad thoughts to yourself, be polite, do not talk about stuff that starts fights, etc.) will allow all these people to have a good time, and keep those negative feelings from causing problems. When different social groups come together having an agreed upon set of ethics, that all choose to follow, will help reduce conflicts."},{"instruction":"Abe Lincoln was a self taught lawyer. Can anyone do something similar these days?","output":"Can anyone do something similar these days? Anyone? As in, more than zero? Sure. But it's a very low number. And most people would not be able to do it. Further, most states do not allow this. But some do. Could you do this? Yes. Are you likely to do this? No, not all likely. Whether is law, medicine, home building, shoemaking, ad nauseum it is often extremely difficult to learn a craft without the helpful guidance of people already skilled in that art. … As an example. A friend of mine once toyed with moving to California to follow their non-degree admission process. (The wisdom of that being a very different question). Point is, this person is squarely within the class of people who “might\\" do the above. Maybe a month ago, this friend and I were talking about a legal issue in a particular legal case. How a certain motion would be decided. In which the litigant asked for a particular remedy. (Which, in my view, was very unwise.) My friend was insistent that the motion should be decided in one particular way because that was the best and most just result for that litigant. I responded that, this simply isn't how judges decide questions. As a rough template, they look at the facts, the law of the case, what the motion asks the judge to do, and the standard (usually determined in previous cases) for making any particular decision. There are reasons judges deviate from this--but that's sort of the place you start from. And in this particular case, the remedy was something that a sensible judge would probably not entertain because it “went too far\\", would prolong the dispute, involved the court too much in trying to monitor the parties, and there was just nothing in the statute which governed the case covering this unusual request. My friend disagreed. Because the judge should do X. It made sense to him, so that was what should be done. … One do the skills that lawyers must develop is separating (1) advocacy for some cause, from (2) what anticipated outcomes might be reasonable or more probable. This is not as simple as it sounds. There are many unwritten rules and practices. Things that people care about when making decisions. Ways that parties lie or are less than honest. Patterns that recur over and over again. Without guidance, it would be quite difficult to bring yourself up to a seasoned practitioner in… many many years."},{"instruction":"What are you doing for your significant other for Valentine's Day?","output":"I'm about to find out as we speak"},{"instruction":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","output":"According to me, Yes!

The [LINKED_TEXT: proxy server] [URL: https://routebig.com/what-is-proxy-server/] stands between you and the online web resource that you are accessing. it acts as a gateway between the content requested by you and the content delivered by the online resource. It can filter or hide the content you are requesting to the online resources to prevent online resource to access your personal information and make you hide or anonymous. How the Proxy server works When you are trying to access the online web resource using your web browser the request goes to the proxy server firstly. The proxy server modifies or encrypted the system or personal related information along with the IP address and forward it to the web resource. Now the web resource responded back with the required web content to the proxy server. The proxy server filters out web information and provides to you. In this way, the proxy server works as a filter and you get the data only you want. Types of Proxy server 1. Transparent Proxy The transparent proxy does not provide any security or privacy while using online web resources. Although it tells the user is connected via proxy and use the actual IP address. Many corporate and collages are using transparent proxies for cache and content filtering rather than adding security and privacy. 2. Anonymous Proxy While accessing the online websites the Anonymous Proxies provide the fake IP address to the websites instead of your actual website address. Anonymous proxies provide more control over your online identity because it hides your IP address but your connection is not as much as private in the VPN. Which hides your IP address and also encrypt the traffic. Sometimes some website detects the Anonymous proxies and they do not allow the user to access the website using anonymous poxy. 3. Distorting Proxy Distorting proxy introduced itself as proxy service to the website and hides the actual information of proxy in use and provide the fake information. The distorting proxy is very useful where the user wants to hide their information as well as the proxy information. It is generally used by the user to access the web resources of other countries. 4. High Anonymity Proxy High Anonymity proxy server provides the advance lever to privacy and security. Not only they hide the IP address and other information, but they can also hide as a proxy server. They continue to change the IP address periodically and make the web server feel like there is no proxy service working for behalf of the user. High Anonymity proxies are used where privacy and security are a big concern because it is the most secure proxy service.

To answer your question of who’s to blame: Nobody. That’s how the Draft goes. Teams pick players that turn into stars, duds, and everything in between. Unfortunately for Portland, a similar situation happened over 20 years later when they took Greg Oden with the #1 pick, with Kevin Durant going #2…"},{"instruction":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","output":"For many, diverse reasons. For one thing, our minds are designed to try to find order even when there isn’t any. That’s why such phenomena as pareidolia (e.g. seeing a face appear among the random dots on a floor tile) exist. So one of the attractive things about conspiracy theories is that they provide a sense of meaning and order behind the chaos of life, current events, etc. So a pandemic for some can turn into attempts by Bill Gates to promote 5G. Even such an inherently insane, unevidenced claim has appeal to some because it’s more comfortable to believe everything is part of the plan than what is best summed up as “shit happens”. It also gives people something to actually rail against and protest against, vs adopting the feeling that they are helplessly and futilely being cast about by the whims of chance. Sometimes it offers a simple explanation to something that has complex, interacting causes. It is simplistic thinking that allows one to think an unsusual snowstorm is more important evidence than complex interactions between global warming, climate systems, ocean currents, etc, or to ignore data showing worldwide warming trends. Local weather is a simple, visceral experience. And it can give someone a sense of superiority over others that they might otherwise lack. It’s a bit like “I may never have done well in school or gotten a good job, but I’m still smarter than you sheeple and them-there scientists.” Etc. It’s like the many irrational bigots on Quora who go around accusing others of being irrational bigots. And all evidence to the contrary of their beliefs becomes more evidence, instead, of The Big Conspiracy or The Big Homogenous Mass With Faults That Isn’t Me. How does your local GP whose wife died from cancer benefit from covering up the Cure? Who the hell knows, but the conspiracy theorist who also lost a wife to cancer will still be angry at that GP, because, god forbid that people are just sometimes powerless. And in some cases it gives people a scapegoat. “The reason I never did well is because the Man kept me down”. So you have Incels blaming everyone else for their lack of personality, poor hygiene, etc. And it is why governments like blaming the latest boogeyman (one minority or another) for their own failure to solve every problem, while blaming opposition parties for failing to solve Every Problem Ever including cancer or 3000 years of war — so they can get re-elected. That said, the world is actually full of conspiracies, from the small scale (a group of friends getting together to plan a prank) to the large scale. So it is sometimes a bit too easy to believe in conspiracies that only exist in one’s mind. After all, a complete lack of belief in conspiracies may be just a delusional as a belief in a particular conspiracy. You do have groups of politicians getting together and figuring out that the way around equal rights laws is to come up with something like Jim Crow laws. Or that the way to get around the popular vote is to engage in gerrymandering. The US government did really experiment on people (MK-Ultra, the Tuskegee Airmen). People with connections have really conspired to allow people to get away with murder (lynchings of blacks). There really were Russian spies in the US in the 1950s (although Joe McCarthy started a total witch hunt over it in order to promote himself). And there are some major conspiracies that are taught in schools (the Boston Tea Party), and some that have had a profound effect upon large populations. There are even conspiracies that involve making people believe in false conspiracies. In early 20th century Russia, for example, anti-semites managed to create the false belief in a world-wide conspiracy of Jews by fabricating the document The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company fame got ahold of a copy eventually, bought into it, published it in his Dearborn Independent gazette and otherwise transmitted it to others, including Adolph Hitler who praised Ford in his book Mein Kampf. There are many other examples of such deliberate disinformation where people ironically form a belief in ideas or even conspiracies while being a victim of a conspiracy themselves. Result? The deaths of millions of innocent Jews in Russia and Europe. Which goes to show you have your Alan Joneses, KKK members, neo-Nazis, and others who are just plain racist, bigoted, sexist, profit-seeking users and abusers who find utility in promoting conspiracies. And sometimes people are, quite simply, correct. No, NOT flat-earthers, or anti-vaxxers or people denying the moon landing or global warming. They’re completely delusional. But, per above, conspiracies do actually exist, and those who uncover them may be doing the world a huge service by doing so. Whether it is exposing industrial pollutors, government abuses, or whatever else.

Although the stock they are selling may be real (mostly an unknown micro-cap stock), the salespeople who hype the product might use misleading or false information due to their desire to sell the stock quickly and get a commission. Stocks that trade on the Pink Sheets or the Over the Counter Bulletin Board are often promoted by them as they have minimal regulation or disclosure requirements. These operations are not only based on coercion and deception, but many of these brokers and salespeople are not qualified to work within the securities industry. They will also go to great lengths in order to con you. These brokers may claim to have offices abroad to create the illusion of wealth and importance, but they actually have virtual offices that include a mailing address and call forwarding.

Water vapour might be the major contributor to the greenhouse effect, but the only way water vapour will increase and push temperatures up further is for there to be an initial increase in temperature. That initial increase has to come from something else such as an increase in CO2 or in solar activity. What we’ve seen since industrialisation and especially since the 1970s is a huge increase in our emissions. This is what is driving temperature change. Temperatures have risen a degree since the 1970s. And it’s not natural because solar activity is falling and the environment adds and takes out CO2 in roughly equal amounts; we only add it, thus the large increase. In fact, it’s increasing about 100 times faster than coming out of the last glacial period. Studies have found that for every degree increase in temperatures from our CO2 causes another degree increase due to the increase in water vapour (because warming means more evaporation, thus more water vapour in the air). Given it’s about a 1:1 relationship. An increase in CO2 comes first then temperature increase. For water vapour, it’s the other way round: temperature increases first, then water vapour. When you look at what’s actually causing temperatures to increase, water vapour drops out as per the diagram below. This is why scientists are more concerned about CO2 (and methane) than water vapour."},{"instruction":"What are best app for photo editing?","output":"Certainly!

Meaning them falling in love with them, when you fall in love you are open and vulnerable to hurt, that’s why those individuals seem smart to the people dating them, because the people that date them are in love with them and suffering from an addiction. Someone dating a personality disorder individual is as vulnerable as a Heroin addict to heroin basically an addict to his drug, the addict knows everything his mind knows that those individuals are bad and toxic, however he is overwhelmed by cravings and they take over, when this happens the addict hits withdrawals the feelings of being unpleasant so they relapse over and over again. It’s like an overweight person trying to lose weight, hell he knows everything that he needs to eat but he just can’t simply apply his knowledge because it takes lots of patience and mind control. No human being can manipulate you in any way shape or form if you don’t allow them to and if you are in full control of your own mind, only when you start to build feelings for that human being and you tend to ignore the red flags you give them an opening to be manipulated. No Psychopath, Narcissist or Sociopath is smart, they are just cold personalities who lack empathy, they have an easier time to manipulate people because most of us normal individuals have high levels of empathy, so we fall vulnerable to their games because we feel everything while they feel nothing. Create a case scenario in your head with 2 individuals punching the same wall: One is your perfectly normal individual who basically punches the wall but everytime that fist hits the wall his wrist starts bleeding and he feels agonizing pain from the force that he applies to wall. The other individual is the one who basically punches the wall and feels absolutely nothing. Who do you think would end up hurt?The first one basically your normal individual who feels everything, while the second one didn’t even experience anything that the first one did. When you fall in love with someone it’s really easy to read a person that has opened up his or her heart to you 6 feet wide and you see through that heart, emotions, chest, it takes no rocket science to read someone that loves you.

Where should I go? What is go inside?","output":"To meditate we are told that we are supposed to sit in lotus posture. We do know how to sit in lotus posture. Then we are asked to go deep inside us. However, how can we go inside us? The tones of all the muscles of our body can synchronize, equalize and unify. In Hinduism the isometrically unified muscle is called Purusha. The point of contraction of the isometrically unified muscle acts as a cursor. It can be moved between our head and feet. When the point of contraction is above the level of the top of our head our sense organs work independent of each other. However, if the point of contraction is below the level of the top of our head, our sense organs merge into a unified sense organ, called Third eye. Now, we can feel, or see with our Third eye, the minutest changes that occur in the tones of the various levels of the unified muscle. Also, we feel that the power supply of all of our thoughts merge into a unified power supply, called soul. Now we reduce the power supply to the least by lowering the point of contraction to the level of the feet, then raise it to various levels. We feel the seven stages in which an idea is processed into an action. This enables us to understand the seven stage muscle tone based thinking mechanism, called Brahman. We can even go below the level of our Positive attitude, which is at the level of our feet, and understand Spirit."},{"instruction":"What NBA team has gone the longest without a championship?","output":"Any team with Lebron James on the roster"},{"instruction":"What is the most advanced invention in the world?","output":"There have been numerous advanced technologies invented throughout human history, and it's difficult to determine which one is the most advanced.

But ‘Hindi’ is special because sometimes it does both, it unites a section of people and triggers another section of people. I am a Kannadiga, my Mother tongue is Kannada and I respect every language including Hindi. Nowadays, I am witnessing an increase in the hatred towards Hindi and North Indian people on Twitter. I regularly see such hateful tweets from my fellow Kannadigas. I am unsure of the exact reasons behind these tweets, but they often state that North Indians are trying to impose Hindi and that it is killing regional languages There are various reasons that have led to these feelings, as sometimes Hindi is given more prominence than other regional languages. However, I will not delve into these reasons. I understand the animosity towards Hindi, but it's concerning that while hating the language, people have begun to dislike Hindi-speaking individuals, which is a bigger issue. Recently, I came across a video where a North Indian individual removed black stickers which were on the Hindi instructions in Bengaluru metro and recorded it. However, some Kannada organizations threatened him and forced him to apologize. This situation illustrates how Hindi can trigger certain sections of the population. It's unfortunate that the individual was threatened and had to apologize The British once divided and ruled us, but it's disheartening to see that now we are dividing ourselves along these lines ,Hope God gives Sadbuddhi to such people. In my case, I have good number of friends from North India, what I felt was that they’re really sweet, good and kind people. They respect my language, They respect my state, They love my culture and We Reciprocate. actually I met most of them in a virtual library called ‘Study together’ during my exams and we became really good friends and we all converse in Hindi, as they don’t know my language but I know Hindi. (there are other 2 south Indian people in our group) we created a Whatsapp group of our own after the exams and we played scribble, ludo, Dumb charades and many other games during our holidays and also we used to talk continuously for hours together on Google meet. But Not even once did they make us feel bad, inferior, or anything similar nor we made them feel bad because of their language.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"The evaluation of education in a school depends on the criteria that you consider. Very often, a school is deemed to be good if students get excellent results. The infrastructure and amenities provided by the school come in a close second. Learners can avail affordable education in public schools, but it is difficult for expatriates to secure admission there. Also, multiple factors play a role for international students to take admission in public schools. However, expatriate or international students can easily find a seat in a private school. Private schools only deny admission to learners based on merit grounds. Moreover, if a Singaporean citizen wishes to study in an international or private school, they must seek permission from the Ministry of Education. The point is that education standards are maintained in both public and private schools. But for expatriates, private schools are a better option, including the students who have plans to study abroad for higher education."},{"instruction":"What do teenagers wish adults understood?","output":"That we go though mood swings and just because we are being a little bit sassy doesn't mean we are trying to be disrespectfully.

There are lakhs of Civil Engineering students graduating every year all around the Globe, so here differents types of question arises:- Is is possible to give job to each and every Civil Engineer who graduates? Is every Civil Engineer is worth to get a good job? Is the Civil engineer who is getting job is proficient in his/her field? Lets talk about the condition of Civil Engineers in India and about their placements. Do you know most of the core Civil companies prefer candidates who have a rich experience. Even if you are studying in good private college their is few changes that you will get placed and will earn good package, except IIT’s , NIT’s. Condition of India is such that in 83% of colleges , Civil Engineering companies are not coming for placement because everyone wants candidate who have rich experience and if in some case you are lucky enough than they will offer you very low package (except IIT’s and NIT’s). This is the total loss of students they get frustrated as they are not able to get job , whereever they go they are asking for experience and if this is not enough some consultants are asking you to pay some amount of money and promising you to give job and later you come to know that it was just a fraud.Now most of the students try to escape from this situation they change their respective field or sometimes go for MBA or any higher studies. They also try for Bank Po exam as number of engineering students are increasing comparatively each and every year as they are left with no option other than this. They also try to join some new and small scale industries in order to gain experience. The circle goes like this and seems to be never ending. The only solution for this is Study hard or gain some experience from small scale Employers , try uploading your Resume to company websites only, regularly check for government exams because they never ask you for experience other than qualifying examination or clear Exams like GATE, IES and then you need not to be worried ever for your future.

One major event in history that changed the world as we know it today was the Partition of the Indian subcontinent. I would probably like to go back to the time when India was being partitioned and try to change that. Nothing lies to you more than History textbooks in school. If you get a chance to read the documents of Britishers from that time, you will understand that the real reason for partition was not because India was too large a country to be governed by the new government but was a result of a domestic dispute. Apparently, both Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to become the first Prime Minister. Since that was not possible and Nehru wasn’t keen on giving up his personal interests, Jinnah demanded a separate country and he would become the Prime Minister of the new one while Nehru will the Prime Minister of the existing country. It was Gandhi Ji who came up with the idea of partition and the same got approval from the British. Had one of the two given up their desire to become the first Prime Minister, we probably would have been living in undivided India. The logic that India was too large to be governed is just a rumour since Australia gained independence around the same time and even though it was larger than India, that wasn’t partitioned. Had we lived in undivided India, a lot of domestic disputes could have been solved automatically. The military could focus on its immediate threat - China and need not worry about Pakistan. The issue of Kashmir would not have seen the light of the day. India could have afforded to lessen its annual military budget and utilised it in other development activities for the upliftment of the nation. It is a pity how power-hungry people are ready to sacrifice the entire nation and its people just to satisfy their personal greed. Had one of them acted sensibly, the issue could have been resolved. Therefore, if I have the chance to go back to the past and rewrite history, I will try to change this part."},{"instruction":"Can I shower with my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra?","output":"IP68 is not the same as waterproof.

I feel that if thousands of Americans losing their life savings, homes, going bankrupt, etc due to costs incurred from debilitating health conditions they had to pay out of pocket for aren’t enough to convince Americans that their system is broken, a bunch of stats aren’t going to make any difference. Additionally, how is it possible that these for-profit insurance companies in the US wouldn’t be engaged in a similar propaganda campaign pushing for the status quo with an opposite set of stats, especially if, as you imply, the ones showing the failure of the American system are lies. Seems like a missed opportunity to promote all the benefits of paying thousands of dollars every year for health care out of pocket. Perhaps the reason there isn’t a similar campaign from “the right” on the opposing side is that it’s too difficult to fabricate lies on this topic, and so what you are actually reading from “the left” is actually the truth. the most accurate truth is this: American private health care is second to none for the rich; for everyone else, 37th in the world."},{"instruction":"What facts about Mumbai would people not believe unless they come to Mumbai?","output":"There’s a tad irony about this fact - “Mumbai is India’s richest city with total wealth of 820 billion, which is home to 46000 millionaires and 28 billionaires.

It is known as an igneous rock because of its origin from the cooling down of molten Magma. During the process of heating and then slow cooling, granite forms as an exceedingly hard material. Granite consists of primarily Feldspar, Quartz which are very hard minerals. Marble is known as metamorphic stone as it is made by the transformation of another type of stone called sedimentary stone. Sedimentary rocks form from sediments in the earth combined with buried plant life under the earth over a long period of time. These sedimentary rocks get metamorphosed into marble beneath intense heat and pressure. This method incorporates different minerals into the marble that can provide the stone engaging colors. To find out which one is better, it is important for you to pay more attention to longevity and hardness.

The entity called 'The entrepreneurship' is actually the material manifestation of such a mind and it's attitude. People have a very rosy colored perspective of entrepreneurship. “Wow! Look at Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk or Richard Branson. Look, where they are.” Yes, they are at a fantastic place- Now! But when they started, they would not have had any entrepreneurship or even money to do it. They just would have had an idea. Whether to make it or throw it away, is their decision. It is their decision, whether to work 20 hours or just two hours on it/ day. Whether to invest more money into it or a lot of time into it. Whether to divide it as short term goals or work on the humongous project, one chip at a time. Whether to run around trying to make people see, what you see. Or to keep extremely quiet about it. Whether to always self- doubt or have faith in yourself and your project. The entrepreneurial mindset is very different from an employee mindset. An employee can go from 9–5pm, do the work with dedication, then come home, switch off work, relax and watch TV or listen to music. An entrepreneur is 'on the job' 24 hours/ 7 days/ 365 days- until you make something of it and later get some helping hand. Think about it. Let us take an example. Every one has a heart. It is beating, always. The second, it stops, the life of the person flies away. It is the same with the entrepreneurship. You, the entrepreneur- is the 'heart' of your entrepreneurship. The second you stop, the life of your project is done! Working as diligently as a human heart- no complaints, no strikes, no year-end reviews, no performance bonus, no applause, no recognition, No- nothing. But, you do the work- as a silent, efficient heart! Pushing the life blood all through the veins of your entrepreneurship, making every adjustment possible, along the way, if possible. Not everyone, is ready for that kind of commitment. It is deep, dedicated and diligent work- the mindset of an entrepreneur- that brings out a fantastic project to glowing recognition! Examples- so many. Whether it is Walt Disney, Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. The entrepreneurial mindset!

What is the highest wind speed in which a plane can land?","output":"There is no single maximum wind speed that cancels flights, as it depends on the direction of wind and phase of flight. A crosswind above about 40mph and a tailwind above 10mph can start to cause problems and stop commercial jets from taking off and landing. A crosswind is a wind that blows across the runway, perpendicular to the direction of the aircraft’s movement. A crosswind can make it difficult for the pilot to align the aircraft with the runway and maintain directional control during take-off and landing. A crosswind above 30-35 kts (about 34-40 mph) is considered restrictive for take-off and landing. A tailwind is a wind that blows in the same direction as the aircraft’s movement. A tailwind can increase the ground speed of the aircraft during take-off and landing, which means it needs more runway distance to accelerate or decelerate. A tailwind above 10-15 kts (about 11-17 mph) is considered limiting for take-off and landing. The highest wind speed that a plane can land in also depends on other factors such as: A headwind is beneficial for take-off and landing, as it reduces the ground speed and increases the lift of the aircraft. It can also help stabilize the aircraft against gusts or turbulence. A headwind that is too strong can cause excessive airspeed or stall conditions.A gust is a sudden increase or decrease in wind speed or direction. It can cause variations in airspeed, lift, drag, and thrust, which can affect the stability and control of the aircraft. It can also make it harder for the pilot to judge the approach speed and flare timing during landing.The condition of the runway surface can affect the friction and braking of the aircraft during take-off and landing. A wet or contaminated runway can reduce friction and increase the stopping distance of the aircraft. A wet or contaminated runway can also reduce the maximum allowable crosswind or tailwind limits.Visibility is the distance at which an object can be seen clearly in daylight or at night. Visibility can be affected by weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow, or dust. Low visibility can make it difficult for the pilot to see the runway lights, markings, or other traffic during take-off and landing. Low visibility can also require special procedures or equipment such as instrument landing systems (ILS) or enhanced vision systems (EVS).

Contact a stockbroker: This is the most common way to invest in foreign stocks, as most Nigerian banks have relationships with global stockbrokers who can facilitate transactions. Stockbrokers are financial professionals who work in brokerage firms or other financial institutions, executing orders in the market on behalf of clients. To contact one, you may start your research online and gather a list of brokers or reach out to friends and network who may be able to help. Once you have your list, set up a meeting with each of them and ask them questions about their services, how they work, what their fees are, etc. After you’ve met with them all, decide which one you want to work with and sign up for an account. For most of the stock brokerage firms, they have limited amounts to start with.

If you are unable to commit the time needed, it may be better to hire a professional trader. d. Stressful – The stock market can be a volatile place and traders can often experience a lot of stress when making decisions about their investments. This can be especially harmful if you are not used to dealing with stress in your everyday life. e. Expensive – Trading stocks can be expensive, especially if you are not doing it yourself. Commission fees from brokers can quickly add up, so it is important to find a broker that offers low commission rates. However with a good financial investment advisor, You can help your investment grow and manage your money under the assistance of a professional mutual broker while investing on high-growth stocks across the US market with their firm equity portfolio of power stocks. 3. Buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are funds that track specific indexes or baskets of securities, and many of them include foreign stocks. This can be a cost-effective way to get exposure to a number of different foreign markets. If you want to buy US exchange-traded funds from any where in the world, you need to open a brokerage account with an international mutual financial investment broker like Victoria Grace Lindsay that offers access to those stock products. Once your account is open, you can transfer money from your bank account to the brokerage account and then use this money to purchase the ETFs that you are interested in. When buying ETFs, it is important to consider the fees that will be charged. Most foreign brokers charge a commission on each transaction, as well as a yearly maintenance fee. Make sure you understand these fees and how they will impact your overall investment returns. Finally, always remember to do your own research before investing in any product. Below are a few examples of popular US exchange-traded funds: – SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) – Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) – iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) – WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DGS) 4.

Buy shares through an international broker: If you have a specific country or region that you want to invest in, you can often buy shares of individual companies through an international broker. This can be expensive and may not be as convenient as using other methods, but it can give you direct exposure to specific markets. When it comes to buying shares through an international broker, there are a few key challenges that investors need to be aware of. The first challenge is that many brokers have different rules when it comes to which countries they can do business in. This can make it difficult for investors to find a broker that is able to execute their trade. The second challenge is that most international brokers charge higher fees than domestic brokers. This is because they have to account for the additional costs associated with doing business across borders. Finally, investors need to be aware of the potential for currency fluctuations when buying shares through an international broker. This can cause the price of the shares to change unpredictably, which can be difficult to manage for investors who are not familiar with foreign markets. 8. Consider alternative investments: Finally, there are a number of alternative investment options that can give you exposure to foreign stocks, such as venture capital funds, hedge funds and private equity investments.

[LINKED_TEXT: Battle of France] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France] This was, in my opinion, the best plan the Germans applied during the war. In the early days of WWII, Germany planned an invasion of France, with its goal being to force French surrender quickly, so that they could focus resources and troops elsewhere. Unfortunately, in between Germany and Paris laid the Maginot Line: a defensive line of state of the art impenetrable bunkers and fortresses, all stocked full with artillery emplacements and troop barracks. In addition, the British Expaditionary Force (BEF) had set up shop up North in Belgium, blocking the path the German Army had taken 17 years prior in 1914, effectively stretching the Maginot Line from Germany’s southern border all the way to the Atlantic. They had every spot covered, save one. The BEF failed to consider that Germany would be willing to send their troops through the Ardennes Forest. German plan of attack for the Western Front. Hence, the Ardennes Forest was left virtually unguarded, and the Germans exploited this advantage to the fullest. The Germans launched two plans, Case Yellow, and Case Red. Case Yellow was launched first, on the 10th of May, 1940. It's essential goal was to punch a deep hole in the Allied line, and separate the BEF, Belgian, and some French forces from the rest of the Maginot line. Hitler, worried that the French armour reserves would mount a counterattack on the Panzer’s southern flank, sent orders through the German High Command to Erwin Rommel, telling him to halt his tanks and dig in. Fortunately for the Germans, Rommel ignored this order, and kept advancing deeper into Allied territory. The Germans defeated Belgium in only a few days, which caused a problem for the Allies. Convinced the Germans were going to mount a frontal attack directly into Belgium, the Belgiums southern flank was exposed, and the German artillery and motorized infantry pummeled them into submission. The BEF and French divisions were counting on at least a week-long resistance by Belgium, and were so unprepared to secure a line to defend the southern flank. Essentially, Case Yellow forced a hasty Allied retreat to Dunkirk (Dunkerque), and further separated the Allied forces from defending Paris or reinforcing the Maginot Line. (Hitler should've attacked the retreating Allied forces at Dunkirk, as without those hundreds of thousands of troops evacuated morale would've been low, and D-Day might not have even taken place.) Case Red was essentially the clean up of the remaining French forces in France. This meant encircling the Maginot Line with a second German attack, and pushing further west and south to Paris. The French were unprepared for this method of Blitzkreig, or Lightning War, as the German strategy mainly revolved around quick advances, swift encirclements and mass surrenders. The French were prepared for trench-style warfare, and so the highly mobilized German tactics caught them off guard, and so lead to the defeat of the French in little over a month. Overall, the invasion plan of France was a very gutsy maneuver, and was successful both due to strategic risks that were taken, as well as risky but rewarding tactical decisions made by German generals and commanders. It's this that I think made it a very risky but very rewarding operation, (apart from letting the Allied troops retreat from Dunkirk to Great Britian)."},{"instruction":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","output":"To buy cheap flight tickets, you can try the following methods and platforms: Flight search engines: Websites like Skyscanner , Kayak and Google Flights are popular flight search engines that allow you to compare prices across multiple airlines and travel agencies.

It says you cannot prepare a particle in a state such that it has both a definite momentum and a definite position at the same time. But it doesn’t prevent you measuring both the momentum and position of a particle to arbitrarily high precision yourself. It is commonly misinterpreted as saying you cannot make a precise (i.e. to arbitrarily many decimal places) measurement of both the x-axis momentum and the position along the x-axis at the same time or on the same particle. This is untrue. It comes from confusing the concept of preparing particles in a state and measuring the state of a particle. Heisenberg actually contributed to this confusion with his microscope thought experiment. The theory only says you cannot prepare a particle so that it has precise values of both momentum and position. The distinction is that you can measure both x and p and get precise values, but when you repeat the process with exactly the same preparation of the particle the measurement will yield different values. So even though you measure precise values there is no sense in which you can say the particle had those values independent of the measurement. And if you repeat the experiment many times, the scatter in the measured values will satisfy in the uncertainty principle. See Ballantine, *“Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development”* pp 225–227 for more complete exposition. To illustrate, you can prepare particles so that their position has only a small uncertainty and when you measure their position and momentum you will get a scatter plot like the blue points below. Each point is a precise measurement of both momentum, p, and position, q. But because the scatter in position is small the scatter in momentum will be big - and the uncertainty principle will the satisfied. The red points illustrate the complementary case in which the particles have a small scatter in momentum, but a big scatter in position. The black points illustrate a preparation in which the momentum and position scatters are similar. Incidentally, the inherent scatter imposed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty is for most purposes very small and, except in very precise laboratory measurements, is swamped by other sources of variability in measurements."},{"instruction":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, “Nope, not worth it” and just left?","output":"Living in the southern half of the UK we don’t get a lot of snow. Something that has aggravated me my whole life. I love snow. First time we had some cracking snow, i was laid up in hospital and could only look at it fall.

That’s when we’ll definitely want to be ensuring we’re attempting to recover the materials in it. That said, it’s not so much the Si, but the other compounds that go along with it. As a base material Si is cheap and readily available. You’d still need to reprocess all the material and regrow Si substrates, etc. About the only thing you save energy on is extraction of some of the less common materials to be re-used from the old Solar Panels. While at 25yrs they are probably going to be in the 80% of original efficiency for panels made in the early 2000’s, and closer to 90% of original efficiency of panels made today. It actually makes more sense to simply keep using the ones we have out there, unless for some reason we start to see lots of failures or we want to limit land usage and we can effectively double the energy output for the same land usage because of efficiency improvements.

Vining (born August 12, 1950) is a retired sergeant major in the United States Army, who was one of the first members of Delta Force . He joined the Army in 1968, and served until 1999. Early life [ edit ] Mike Vining was born on August 12, 1950, in Greenville, Michigan, to Roger and Arlene Vining.

Not all connections balance out in the current lifetime, which is why not all TF pairs achieve Union in this one lifetime. They might get a chance at it again in a future one, depending on their current soul contract and which lessons they came to learn in this lifetime. Nothing harmful happens to the runner as such if they choose not to do the inner work, but depending on what their soul signed up to do in this lifetime, the Divine (God) may push them into a very violent DNOTS (more violent than the chaser’s) to force them into healing and leveling up. In this regard, it’s also to be noted that there’s a belief or mis-belief among some DFs that they can magically pull their DM along if they heal by themselves, since they believe this will heal the connection as a whole - that’s not really how it works, sorry. It’s as if you were a mother with a feverish baby and believed that drinking the medicine yourself would automatically heal the baby and nurse it back to health. See how improbable that sounds? The runner has to heal by themselves, but whether they do so or not is between them and God, not between the chaser and runner. That said, I presume you’re referring to the DM as runner? While it’s true that the DM is indeed the initial runner, the DF (initial chaser) can become runner in turn too, once they stop chasing the DM and trigger separation. I’m the DF and I actually did this, and I can assure you that I’ve been forced to continue healing during my DM’s DNOTS. I did try to resist it in the initial weeks of turning runner, but I’ve been forced to look at it just as my DM has. My ego rose tremendously when I turned runner and I started blaming him for everything bad that had ever happened to me, but this only made me sad and bitter. I’ve been forced to address and heal many issues that I was purposely ignoring in myself. All I can say is that if God chooses to, He spares no one.

Not real life. Popularity here is ephemeral. A few hundred among my 189K followers may notice my absence and wonder what happened and why I am not to be seen any more and may post a question asking about my whereabouts. But that is about all. No one will really miss me. They will soon forget I existed. Are there not enough examples already of popular writers here who are no longer around? They either got banned or they left on their own. There are enough other good writers here. I don’t believe I will be creating any void if I leave or am forced to leave Quora. Even in real life, before my retirement I was in touch with hundreds of people professionally. I ran my own setup and gave jobs to over 50 people in the few years I managed the show. None of them are in touch with me now. They have all moved on in life. For a year or two after retirement, I did get a Happy Birthday or New Year greeting message from a few of them on WhatsApp or email but now even that has ended. I don’t feel sad about it. That is the way it should be. We all need to practice detachment. One day, I will end my association with Quora. It is inevitable. I have not planned any date but nature does not consider feelings or willingness of those whose time has come. Health and mental faculties will only deteriorate with the passage of time. I will do my best to postpone that date when it is no longer possible to be active like I now am. I am not keen to know what that date will be. I will continue on Quora indefinitely till the day comes when you don’t see any question, A2A, answer or comment from me for a few days in a row. If it is to happen due to my being away from my laptop during my travels I will inform in advance. But if it is sudden and unexplained, I am sure you can all guess what must have happened. 70 is not age where you can be sure of what will happen tomorrow!

Even if he did, his fellow countrymen would have turned on him in a minute. Virtually no one in America wanted a king. Political enemies sometimes accused their opponents of wanting to be king, but it was never a serious idea. After the Revolution, Washington was content to live in relative luxury at his large estate at Mount Vernon. He had achieved world acclaim for his services and had all the money and comforts he could ever want. Governing, whether as king, president, or any other title, was a headache and a distraction from the life he wanted. He reluctantly accepted the position as president because he feared the continent might descend into chaos without a stronger government than existed under the Articles of Confederation. He became president because the consensus of other leaders was that the new government would not work without him leading it.

This whole fiscal responsibility mantra they chant goes back to Nixonian political strategy and goes like this: pillory the Democrats on the alter of the New Deal and blame these social programs they champion for the deficit while wearing the mantle of the fiscally responsible party; once in power, ignore the debt, drive up the deficit through tax cuts and deregulation and, after the debt goes up, blame the Democrats for the increase and champion further rugged individualism (austerity) for the poor and socialism for the rich. Watch as the Democrats pay down the debt, then rinse and repeat. Here’s a big truth-the debt doesn’t really matter; only growth does, which shrinks the debt in relative proportion, which makes the economy a denominator issue. Supply side economics attempts to stimulate growth through giving the rich more money and allowing it to trickle down into the economy all the while attempting to shrink spending. Which makes supply side economics a numerator problem that increases the impact of the debt on the economy.

What do they do to grow their company every day?","output":"The 10 Roles of a Startup CEO The measure of time you spend on every part will change each day, and it'll unquestionably change contingent upon the phase of your business – for instance, you'll invest significantly more energy in client support at 0/month than at 1M/month – yet the parts themselves are consistent. 1) Recruiter New businesses need individuals. Astonishing individuals. At a greater organization, finding astonishing individuals is the all day occupation of multi-individual divisions. At a startup, it falls on the CEO. Everything from making sense of where your greatest needs are, to sorting through the weeds to discover unprecedented possibility to making sense of how you're going to pay them, all falls under the part of the Recruiter. In the event that you fall flat here, your startup will, as well. 2) Cheerleader In case you're building something from nothing, there will be times when things suck. Not \\"having an awful day\\" suck, but rather \\"the world is completion\\" suck. Your group, now and again, is going to feel like you have no shot at succeeding. Those are the minutes when regardless of whether you really do succeed is resolved. Keeping spirit high and keeping your group energized are basic to efficiency and development. However, it's not simply cheerleading amid the most exceedingly bad of times that is essential. Giving your group positive input and demonstrating to them the amount you value them is a significant part that should be filled each and every day in a startup CEO's life. 3) Coach Pretty much as you have to demonstrate your group that they're valued, you likewise need to push them to succeed. Incredible CEO's are awesome mentors. They help their group set objectives, plan for the future and realign them when they veer off base. In the event that and when you don't hit your objectives, you help everybody venture back and reassess what's sensible and what should be possible better. I've discovered that being available to the group and planning consistent one-on-one's with each and every individual is a colossal variable in being a fruitful mentor. You can't mentor a player unless you comprehend their abilities, objectives, difficulties and concerns. You must realize that about everybody. 4) Dealmaker Associations can be an effective approach to develop at any phase of your startup. When you're a startup, numerous organizations will just work with you on the off chance that they're managing straightforwardly with the CEO. Having the capacity to offer the vision of your organization and the advantages of working with you to potential accomplices, much the same as you did with your clients, speculators and representatives, can prompt enormous helps in introduction and development for your business. 5) Student In case you're not learning, you're slowing down. Books, online journals, guides – these are all assets I wind up taking advantage of always to learn. It's the place I get thoughts for everything from advertising and situating to item outline and administration. Beside a modest rate of top CEO's (who aren't understanding this at any rate, since they don't have to), it's crazy to believe that you definitely know all that you have to know not an incredible CEO. None of us do. Also, we probably never will. Since extraordinary CEO's – the ones I respect most – know how much there still is left to learn. 6) Firefighter It's unavoidable: there will be times when the serious trouble completely rises to the surface. A mammoth administration blackout. A PR emergency. A group issue. As the CEO, you're an accessible as needs be firefighter, all day, every day. Regardless of what you're doing when that happens, your occupation is to promptly get the hose and begin putting out the flame. And afterward enhancing that some portion of your business so it can't burst into flames once more. 7) Strategist n a startup, a lot of your day is spent impeded in strategies. Be that as it may, while strategies can drive little everyday wins, methodology is the thing that advises those strategies and at last fills long haul development. That is the reason as CEO, one of your parts is to purposely require some investment to consider procedure from a 40,000-foot viewpoint. Where might you want to be in 12 months? In five years? Also, what are the master plan key choices you have to make (and moves you have to make) to arrive? 8) Salesperson From the principal day that you bring forth your thought, you turn into a sales representative. You offer to speculators, to enlisted people, to accomplices, to clients, to influencers and to any other person who can help you develop. Regardless of the fact that you \\"despise deals,\\" you're doing it, and showing signs of improvement at it is one of the greatest influence focuses you have. 9) Customer Support Champion In the event that your clients don't succeed, you don't, either. In the most punctual days, your part as bolster champion means holding each client's hand as they battle through your unrefined model. It implies listening hard and learning all that you can about your clients' needs, difficulties, fears and trusts. It means being the voice of the client in each item improvement meeting, and assembling the criticism you have to settle on shrewd choices about the fate of the organization. The client improvement side of things never stops, and the one-on-one ticket backing may back off, however that shouldn't totally stop, either. The absolute most profitable bolster I ever did was burning through 20 hours every week doing client advancement when we were at that point surrounding 100K in MRR. 10) Decider A standout amongst the most hazardous spots for a startup to be is in examination limbo. At the point when the group can't meet up and settle on a choice, everything backs off, and that is not a state you can stay in and plan to survive. As the CEO, you'll have to venture in and settle on troublesome choices. Now and again, they'll separate the group, or irritate clients. Also, you'll need to make sense of how to settle it and proceed onward. It's presumably the part of being CEO that I like slightest, but on the other hand it's the part where you likely have the most effect."},{"instruction":"there is any chance to grow?

Koreans are very good at remembering facts, figures and words, but sometimes using those facts and figures to create a new idea seemed to be lacking. Also for the students, the focus on education seemed to be stressful to many of them. After a full day of school, their mom would take them to piano, additional math lessons (Kumon), Tae Kwon Do and other lessons. The students seemed to be pushed into not being children. I found some who rejected it by just not caring if they learned or not and others who were very driven. As a teacher, it was easy to tell which ones were being pushed into it vs. which ones were happy to learn. Also, I remember reading in the news about students who would commit suicide because they failed or couldn’t get into the university of choice or the one that their father, brother or sister got into.

For example, some patients require a dental crown for a tooth that has broken down, yet another might want to replace an existing metal or discoloured crown with a porcelain crown to match in with existing teeth following whitening. Cosmetic dentistry is where the dentist is performing treatment to enhance a patient’s smile. Dental Hygiene Sometimes a trip to the dental hygienist can vastly improve a smile. Our hygienists also offer Airflow which is a treatment to remove heavy staining from teeth, almost like a gentle sandblasting. Tooth whitening Whitening treatments have a huge impact on the way you look and can be done in house or at home, or a combination of both. Veneers These are wafer thin slivers of porcelain that are bonded to the front surface of teeth to improve the look of worn, broken, discoloured or gappy teeth. They are made at specialist laboratories to look indistinguishable from natural teeth. They aren’t always the best solution but in cases where they are, they achieve an excellent aesthetic result. Crowns Dental crowns can be made to replace broken down teeth. The materials are now so highly advanced that a completely natural look can be achieved in many cases, especially when used in conjunction with gum contouring. Composite Bonding This technique can be used to repair and/or enhance natural teeth. The materials are excellent so the result looks completely natural. This treatment has the advantage of being minimally invasive and is often a good alternative to veneers. Bridges These can be used to replace missing teeth either with or without dental implants. Dental Implants These are used to replace missing teeth and essentially become a new tooth. They can look completely natural, can function like normal teeth and if looked after, can last as long as natural teeth. They also have the benefit of preserving facial bone which would otherwise be lost without a ‘root’ of a tooth, and this in turn helps to keep the years off your face! Orthodontics We offer invisible orthodontics and 6 Month Smiles. Sometimes orthodontics is used to move teeth into a position to maximise the aesthetic result of veneers, crowns or bridges. Gum Contouring This is done to improve the health of your gums and the appearance of your smile. It can achieve a more uniform gum line.

Let’s start building the function. Since [math]f(f(1)) = 3[/math], and [math]f[/math] is increasing, the only option is [math]f(1) = 2[/math], and we have [math]f(1) = 2[/math] [math]f(2) = 3[/math] [math]f(3) = 5[/math] [math]f(5) = 7[/math] which forces [math]f(4) = 6[/math] Then we can go ahead and get [math]f(6) = 9[/math] [math]f(7) = 11[/math] [math]f(9) = 13[/math] And we got “lucky” again because there’s only one possible value for the next gap [math]f(8) = 12[/math] But I claim that was no luck. The gap between [math]f(7)[/math] and [math]f(9)[/math] was exactly [math]2[/math] because [math]7[/math] and [math]9[/math] were the images of two consecutive numbers (namely [math]5[/math] and [math]6[/math]) So, if we can prove that the gap between two consecutive images is always [math]1[/math] or [math]2[/math], we’re done. Why? If a number [math]n[/math] has already appeared in the second column, i.e. if it is [math]f(k)[/math] for some [math]k[/math], then we know that [math]f(n)[/math] will be [math]2k+1[/math]. Otherwise, we’ll have to have a [math]k[/math] such that [math]f(k) = n-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = n+1[/math], which means that [math]f(n-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(n+1) = 2k+3[/math], and [math]f(n)[/math] is forced to be [math]2k+2[/math]. So let’s prove that Claim: For every [math]k in N[/math], [math]f(k+1) - f(k) in {1,2}[/math] Proof: We’ve already proved this for [math]k leq 9[/math]. Now assume this is true for all [math]k < m > 7[/math]. We want to prove that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math] or [math]2[/math]. Since [math]f(m-1) > m+1[/math] (given that [math]f(7) = 11 > 7+1[/math] and that [math]f[/math] is strictly increasing, which means that [math]f(n) - n[/math] is non-decreasing), and, by hypothesis, there is no gap bigger than 2 in the consecutive values of the function up to this point, that means that ther exists a [math]k < m[/math] such that either [math]f(k) = m[/math] or [math]f(k) = m-1[/math]. Suppose that both [math]m[/math] and [math]m-1[/math] are in the image of [math]f[/math]. Then necessarily (by monotonicity), we need to have [math]f(k) = m-1[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math] for some [math]k[/math], which means that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 2k + 3 - (2k + 1) = 2[/math], and we’re done. If [math]m[/math] isn’t on the image, by the induction hypothesis, we’ll have a [math]k<m[/math] such that [math]f(k) = m-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = m+1[/math], which means that [math]f(m-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m+1) = 2k+3[/math], hence [math]f(m) = 2k+2[/math] and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], done. The only case left is that [math]m[/math] is on the image of [math]f[/math], but [math]m-1[/math] is not. Then we have [math]f(k) = m-2[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math], [math]f(m-2) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m) = 2k+3[/math], [math]f(m-1) = 2k+2[/math], and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], Q.E.D. PS: naively, one would expect [math]f(n)/n[/math] to converge to [math]sqrt{2}[/math], but it doesn’t seem to be true. Actually, [math]f(n)/n[/math] oscillates between 4/3 and 3/2. Here’s the plot of [math]f(n)/n[/math] for [math]n<10^7[/math] The distance between consecutive crests (or valleys) grows exponentially, with a factor of 2, since [math]f(n) = 3/2 ; n Rightarrow f(3/2 ; n) = 2n + 1 = 4/3 ; (3/2 ; n) + 1Rightarrow f(2n+1) = 3n + 1 = 3/2 ; (2n + 1) - 1/2[/math] PPS: The simple pyhton script I used to calculate [math]f[/math] up to [math]10^7[/math]: f = {1:2} k=1 for i in range(2,10000000): while f[k] < i: k = k+1 if f[k] == i: f[i] = 2*k+1 if f[k] == i+1: f[i] = 2*k"},{"instruction":"What's a good digital marketing agency in the UAE?","output":"They are many agency in Dubai you can search out Google map and many sports there are providing a distal agency and digital Services one of the institute is providing a career growth in digital marketing with event management.

Through this usage, ancient Sanskrit texts do sometimes use the word ‘lingam’ to mean penis, but the vast majority of uses of the word have nothing to do with genitalia.

It's an exciting space that has captivated the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Now, you're wondering what to invest in during 2022. Well, let me shed some light on this topic for you. First and foremost, it's important to clarify that investing in cryptocurrency is legal. Over the years, governments and regulatory bodies have recognized its potential and implemented frameworks to ensure its legitimacy. However, as with any investment, it's crucial to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before diving in. Now, let's talk about the potential profitability of investing in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be a lucrative investment avenue for many individuals. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, experienced significant price appreciation over the past decade, making early investors incredibly wealthy. This success story has inspired countless others to explore the world of digital currencies. However, it's essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate wildly in short periods, which can lead to substantial gains or losses. To make informed investment decisions, consider the following factors: 1. Research and Educate Yourself: Knowledge is power in the world of crypto. Take the time to understand blockchain technology, different cryptocurrencies, and their use cases. Stay up-to-date with industry news and developments. 2. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider investing in a mix of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as promising altcoins with unique value propositions. 3. Understand Risk Appetite: Determine your risk tolerance before investing in crypto. If you're comfortable with higher risks, you may consider investing in smaller cryptocurrencies with potential for significant returns. Conversely, if you prefer stability, focus on more established and widely adopted cryptocurrencies. 4. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with financial advisors or cryptocurrency experts who can provide valuable insights and guidance tailored to your investment goals. They can help you navigate the complexities of the market and mitigate potential risks. 5. Keep Security a Priority: Safeguard your investments by adopting best practices for storing and securing your digital assets. Utilize reliable cryptocurrency wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and beware of phishing attempts and scams. 6. Stay Informed About Regulations: Governments worldwide are continuously updating regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. Stay informed about the legal landscape of your country to ensure compliance with relevant laws. Remember, investing in cryptocurrency carries inherent risks, just like any other investment. It's crucial to approach it with a long-term perspective, realistic expectations, and a willingness to learn from both successes and setbacks. Ultimately, whether you choose to invest in cryptocurrencies or not is a personal decision that should align with your financial goals and risk appetite. If you decide to venture into this exciting realm, do so responsibly, armed with knowledge and a solid investment strategy.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"It happened to me. I’m staying anonymous for obvious reasons. A few years back, part of my job required me to travel abroad. I spent 2-3 months home and abroad alternatively for about 2 years. I had a 2-year-old son and a side business which a few friends and I cofounded. I was busy with my day job so my wife helped run the store on my behalf so she spent a lot of time working at the store along with my friends One day, I was abroad and got a phone call from my wife saying she was pregnant again. It was totally unexpected, but soon the happy feeling overcame the vague doubt that I had. Fast forward a few years, I no longer had to travel for work and had 2 little boys that I love dearly. Everybody says my older son is a smaller version of me while the young one doesn't look anything like me, not in the slightest. I never had any suspicion about our biological relationship until one day I found out a conversation between my wife and one of my friend (who was married and had a child. Let's call him Ken) when I was away in which he confessed his affection for her. My wife denied any relationship between them and said that it was only Ken and that she did not reciprocate. I was shocked and could not believe Ken could do that to me, but it was just the beginning. Since then I had had this uneasy feeling. Somehow I knew my wife wasn't telling the truth, but I have no way to find out. As my younger boy growing up, he takes after Ken. I told myself I needed to settle this once and for all. I took DNA tests, twice. And as you can guess the two results confirmed that I was not the biological father. I was lost. Not in my wildest dream can I imagine this would happen to me. I asked my wife to tell me the truth, and with the evidence at hand, she couldn't deny it anymore and admitted to having an affair with my friend when I was gone. My world collapsed. I walked away broken. I wandered for a month here and there thinking about what I did wrong and for what purpose I was living. After I regain my sanity. I called my friend in the calmest way I can to inform him he had a son that he didn't know of and told him I was ready to give him back. Then I called my wife and said I wanted a divorce and everything had been arranged for that to happen the earliest possible. I want revenge. \\"They have to pay for what they did to me.\\" I thought. I fully provided for my wife financially, she had no job and wouldn't be able to support the child alone. Ken, on the other hand, was a successful businessman but he had a family with two daughters and I was sure he wouldn't have the courage to tell his wife about this, and I was right. For almost a year when we were in the middle of the divorce, he never once visited his son nor provided any support for him. I guess he was busy covering things up. I could have easily talked to his wife (we’re also friends) but I refrained. I did not want his innocent kids to be in the same situation as mine, at least not because of me. So we agreed that my older son would stay with me and the younger one would live with his mother after the divorce. My older son is kind of smart. He can take care of himself. He learned the alphabet, colors, and shapes by himself by watching youtube videos when I was gone for business (English is not our mother tongue and we’re living in an English speaking country). The second one is not as smart. He's soft and sentimental. So in a way I was really worried about him. I thought I would feel better after I had my revenge. I did not. When my selfishness died down, I really missed my younger son and the time we were together. I missed the time when he kissed me goodbye before I left for work on the sidewalk every morning and immediately ran to the front window, placed a chair so he could look outside and waved at me as I drove off. If you have children you probably know how that feels. As the divorce was closing (it was complicated because of the nature of our marriage), I dropped by one day to see him. His mother had to find a job, so she did not have the time to take good care of him as when they were living with me. He immediately dashed and hugged me as soon as I showed up at the doorstep. I got a look at him for a long time. He was having a skin disease due to the hygiene of the water where he was living and obviously was not in good shape. That hit me hard to look back and think how cute and healthy he used to be. When he asked \\"Dad, when will you pick me up and return home?\\", I was in tear before I knew it. I spent the night with him that day. In his dream, he was crying: \\"I want my dad. Where's my dad?\\". Suddenly all the memories came back, that moment when I first hold him in my arms on his birthday, all the white nights feeding him and changing explosive diapers while humming songs that do not exist trying to get him to sleep, that moment when he made his first step, all the family outing days when we ran, laughed, kissed and sang… All of those made I realize what was important to me and how bad I was as a father. I had failed my sons miserably. I just need my children to be happy. It didn't matter if he was my biological child or not. Our bond was real and strong. I love him, and he loves me. That's all that matters. I grew up with the blessing and love of my parents. Why did I let my son suffer because of the mistake he didn't make? I cried out loud like a child, it feels good to show your true feelings once in a while… Fast forward a year, we're now together again. I talked to Ken. We agreed the boy is MY son and he had to stay away from him for the rest of his life. The boys are growing fast, happy, and loved. I'm glad I got them in my life. This fatherhood is something I wouldn't trade the world for. I love my sons and still learning to be a good father... Update Thank you all for reading the story of my life and for commenting. I would like to clarify a few things: When I say my younger son was soft and sentimental, I did not mean in a negative way. Imagine you were a parent bear in the wild and you had two cubs. One was strong and smart, the other was not as so.

Update 2 (and final) Wow, the response to my story was overwhelming so I decided to give some updates:I guess this story is incomplete without talking about my wife. Because of the immigration status, a divorce means separation for all of us so we’re putting that off. My wife and I are staying in the same roof like roommates. I’m helping her get all the trainings necessary for a better job when the situation changes. We’re staying friends and I sincerely hope things turn out better for her. After all, she’s still the mother of my kids and no one is happy to see their mom struggle.For those who called me weak, sucker… I thank you for thinking for me and I appreciate it. I totally understand your rationales. Had this not happened to me, I would have never thought I could do this. But when it’s a reality, you have to deal and learn from it. I’m glad I learned how to forgive and experienced love. You know that cliché saying ”When life gives you lemons, make lemonade”?

Then both variants of TDM where in fact 32-bit applications allowing to build 64-bit applications on 32-bit systems. Today MinGW in 64-bit variant can build both and as most developers use 64-bit systems existence of TDM doesn't make that much sense. Traditional GCC from official repository is unable to build working code for Windows. I think it could generate one with proper calling conventions in COFF format (that actually may be binutils not gcc), but required libraries and headers aren't present."},{"instruction":"w does Iron Dome work, the system that protects Israel from rockets?","output":"The American defense company Raytheon , in cooperation with Israeli-owned defense contractor Rafael's Advanced Defense System, builds the Iron Dome system. Here's how Raytheon describes the weapon: Iron Dome consists of three main parts. A sophisticated radar that detects incoming threats. A control system developed by Israeli firm mprest that takes the information from the radar, instantly analyzes it and computes next steps. And the mobile \\"firing units,\\" each of which contains 20 Tamir rockets that intercept the incoming fire. Israel employs several of these batteries, which cover roughly 60 square miles (155 square kilometers) each and reportedly cost 10 million apiece. Step 1: Enemies Rockets are fired- In this the enemies would target their air missiles or rockets towards Israel Step 2: Detection by Radar- The Radar System of Israel detects the rockets and its tracks that may penetrate the air space of Israel Step 3: Control System estimates Impact Point- The control system in the dome intercepts the target point of the rockets fired Fire Missiles launched- The Launcher fires the missiles to intercept. The best thing about Iron Dome is that it would not act on the threats that it can intercept to fall in uninhabited areas. Step 5: Rockets destruction- The missiles are launched which explode close to the rockets thereby destroying them. It has remarkable success in neutralizing thousands of rockets about 90% of them are destroyed in air only causing only some infrastructure damage.

I have seen my fair share of weird orders, particularly involving the amount of cheese (I once had someone order a grill cheese sandwich with 8 slices of cheese and tomatoes, and a burger patty). Nothing beats this particular order though. It was a typical day, a rush of evening orders coming in. The cashier (he happened to have joined just a week back), comes up to me confused about an order he had just gotten. Apparently, the request was that we make the cheeseburger without a bun. That's fine, nothing new. Then I realized the order was for a double cheeseburger, with no bun. I asked him to check agaim and confirm if indeed that's what the customer wanted. He said yes. I ended up making a cheeseburger with two slices of cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle in between two burger patties.

Among them, coir based mattresses are fabricated using the fibers from outer husk of a coconut. Due to their organic nature, they are very well suited for the people who are allergic to synthetic substances. The greatest advantage of such mattresses is that they are very well ventilated and thus provide enhanced hygroscopic properties, i.e., they impart great air circulation and moisture absorption characteristics. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the [LINKED_TEXT: bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. On the other hand, foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or others who prefer body hugging comfort. In fact, due to their therapeutic properties, memory foam mattresses are commonly known by their secondary name - Orthopedic Mattresses. While, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. They also tend to be marginally more ‘bouncy’ than their memory foam counterparts. So, those who prefer less sunken sitting/lying experience would find PU foam mattresses a great choice. A great advantage of PU foam mattresses is that they are relatively light in weight as compared to the other two configurations. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should opt for relative to the dimensions of the bed, and awareness about the ways by which some brands resort to cutting production costs by using low-grade materials in the fabrication of the mattresses, that cause several neck and spine issues, too play crucial roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 1st November, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration.

You want as many people as possible with intimate knowledge of how the algorithms work banging on it and trying to crack it. If I tell you in minute detail how the algorithms work and you still cannot crack it then that is considered secure. Another consideration is that HTTPS uses signed certificates. I can create my own self signed certificate but when you try to access my site through HTTPS your browser will throw up all kinds of warning messages because the certificate is not signed by a recognised authority. I used a self signed certificate when running a web accessible file server. It was just for my friends and I so there was no reason to pay for a signed certificate. The actual encryption is the same. The only difference is who is vouching for you. To get a signed certificate the company you choose for validation will require paperwork to validate you are who you say you are.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","output":"If your GP deems the tests necessary they are carried out without charge to the patient. The semcenario you propose of having a test just because you feel like it is not normally allowed. However I had a condition some years ago that requires me to take daily medications. My GP usually schedules a blood test on an annual basis to check that my organs are still performing within normal parameters and have not deteriorated. Usually liver function, kidneys and cholesterol are checked as standard, there may be some other tests that will be added onto the list. The GP will discus your ailment with you and order the tests to confirm his suspicions/ diagnosis.

It is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the body is unable to produce or effectively use insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels. While there are several conventional treatments available, many people turn to Ayurvedic medicine for a more holistic approach to managing their diabetes. Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. It is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic practitioners use a combination of herbal remedies, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications to address the root cause of health problems and restore balance to the body. One of the most popular Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes is called “Maha Sudarshan Churna”. It is a combination of various herbs such as guduchi, ginger, cinnamon, and turmeric. These herbs are known to have antidiabetic properties and can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation in the body. Guduchi, also known as Tinospora cordifolia, is a powerful immune booster that has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Ginger, another common ingredient in Ayurvedic medicines, can help improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood sugar levels. Cinnamon is known to enhance insulin sensitivity and improve glucose metabolism. Turmeric, which contains the active compound curcumin, has anti-inflammatory properties and can help protect against complications associated with diabetes. While Ayurvedic medicines can be beneficial for people with diabetes, it is important to note that they should always be taken under the supervision of a trained practitioner and should not replace conventional medical treatments. It is also essential to make lifestyle modifications such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, managing stress, and maintaining a healthy weight to effectively manage diabetes. In conclusion, Maha Sudarshan Churna is a popular Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes that contains a combination of herbs with antidiabetic properties. While Ayurvedic medicines can be helpful in managing diabetes, it is important to consult with a trained practitioner and follow conventional medical treatments to effectively manage the condition. Making lifestyle modifications such as healthy eating and regular exercise is also essential in managing diabetes and maintaining overall health and wellness.

In this answer, we will explore the key responsibilities of a business analyst. Requirements gathering and analysis: The first responsibility of a business analyst is to gather and analyze the requirements of stakeholders. This involves conducting meetings with stakeholders, conducting surveys and workshops, and reviewing existing documentation to gain an understanding of the organization's business needs. Steps to learn skills The best way to acquire new skills is to learn from others who already have them, or join a workshop, meeting, or mastermind group. Another way to acquire new skills is to work on real-time projects. Real-time and Capstone projects are available to all learners. Two capstone projects and more than a dozen industry projects are part of Business Analytics. If you list these projects on your resume, you are more likely to be considered for a job. Some examples of such business analytics projects are Customer feedback analysis, etc. The most important way to acquire new skills is to take online courses specializing in a particular area. This is a great way to learn when you have time to sit in a classroom and prepare for a lesson. Once you are done with the training, put it into action. You'll have access to more materials so you may keep learning. For those who wish to put what they have learned into practice while working on real-world projects in real-world settings, this below institute also offers Hybrid Learning sessions. You can become a qualified business analyst by enrolling in one of the various institutions available to you online and offline. Let us take a look at some of them. This is a great resource for getting a business analytics certification. Many of the elements of the business analytics program are available exclusively at this institute. Instead of recorded courses, they offer live courses. Business analytics is a skill that can be learned in any field. Overview: Business Analytics Program IBM certification: Each participant in the Business Analytics program receives a valid certificate, called the course completion certificate. On the other hand, a certificate of completion, several qualification certificates, and project certificates are given to every participant who completes an Advance Data Science and AI program. Project Innovation Lab: It offers its Project Innovation Labs throughout the country. There are Project Innovation Labs in the following cities: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, and Kolkata. Real-time Projects: Additionally, it provides ongoing projects on significant business analytics subjects. Your comprehension of business analytics and problem-solving skills will both be improved by working on them. The following examples of actual industrial projects covered by the business analyst program: Learning and creating categorization methods for the banking industry's digital transformation, etc. For those who want to move up in their field, specialization in a particular area and real-time projects are essential. The two together will be of great help to you. Using domain-specific training in data science courses, you can address the knowledge and skills that are specific to a particular industry or field. This can help business analysts focus on areas of expertise and develop those skills to mastery. Domain-specific modules: Sales and Marketing, Transportation, media and hospitality, Energy, oil and gas. There are numerous other domains you can choose from. Coursera is an online learning platform, that offers a number of data science-related courses and programs from top universities and institutions. It also offers a wide range of courses in data science, including a Master's degree in Data Science from top universities such as the Indian School of Business and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. The platform also offers several specializations and degree programs in data science. However, it lacks job assistance. In conclusion, as a business analyst, you must be able to gather and analyze requirements, model and improve business processes, analyze data, manage stakeholder relationships, develop and implement solutions, and focus on continuous improvement. By doing so, you will help organizations to achieve their goals and to drive business success.

In other words, it is a dream in which you know that you are dreaming. This awareness allows the dreamer to have a certain level of control and volition within the dream environment.During a lucid dream, the dreamer may be able to consciously manipulate or direct the events, characters, and surroundings within the dream. They can choose to fly, explore different landscapes, interact with dream characters, and even alter the dream's storyline. Lucid dreaming can be a vivid and immersive experience, where the dreamer can actively engage and participate in the dream world.From a spiritual perspective, some people believe that lucid dreaming can offer a deeper understanding of oneself, provide opportunities for personal growth and exploration, and even serve as a gateway to spiritual realms. It is thought that lucid dreaming allows individuals to access higher levels of consciousness and tap into their inner wisdom. Astral projection (also known as astral travel) is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience (OBE) that assumes the existence of a subtle body called an \\"astral body\\" or \\"body of light\\" through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the astral plane. The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The modern terminology of of \\"astral projection\\" was coined and promoted by 19th-century Theosophists ."},{"instruction":"f you were at a job for only 3 days and wanted to quit, would you put in your 2 weeks or just leave?","output":"You should always give a 2 weeks notice when leaving. Your employer can then decide if they need you for those two weeks or if you can leave on the same day."},{"instruction":"the UK, can a resident get him/herself checked (e.g. blood tests, scans) for cancer free of charge on NHS? Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","output":"This Answer was originally a Comment, but I realised it outgrew itself… There seems to be an incredulous tone to many ‘is it true that’ Questions about healthcare in the UK, most with a strong implication it can't be possible because whoever asked lives somewhere every attempt to make affordable public heathcare work has been actively sabotaged. This probably won't make any impression on those who prefer a fantasy version where it costs millions to get treatment that, in fact - because it's not run like a protection racket - at most costs a few thousands - but like a few million other people over sixty, I had a ‘free’ colonoscopy and - having ticked the ‘just take care of it’ box - some precancerous polyps were excised. That exercise was repeated for a few years, with excellent results, all at no direct cost to me (as a retiree I no longer contribute to the NI scheme though I did so throughout my working life). Now I take tests, it takes no effort, the cost to the country is low, far, far lower than treating cancer. This means public health money is spent more wisely, instead of piling on bills in order to get money from HMOs who pad bills and do anything to avoid paying out - all in the pursuit of profits - so here we have many proactive health initiatives and onging programmes - like free ‘flu shots for the last half century - that scale back the problems. Having parents who were both cancer victims, diagnosed too late to do much about it, and a number of relatives who gave also passed in that way, I'm glad I didn't have to sell my house to buy a fraction of the level of care I received - care that wouldn't be part of any ‘affordable’ health insurance scheme of the sort that are considered universal - but that leave huge numbers (more people than live in the UK) entirely without any kind of healthcare in the USA, only because of the way billions of dollars are not used to treat people, but generate profit, treating them as a cash cow at every turn. When I realised a slight hearing loss in one ear worsened dramatically, I booked a hearing test at the local hospotal. That took only a couple of weeks, the hearing loss was confirmed, and I was given a cranial MRI scan only a half hour later, free of charge and without an apointment. It was clear, and after a fortnight I got a hearing aid - also free at the point of delivery - and the right to receive free batteries for life… But try telling that to a person who thinks an MRI scan is unaffordable for technical reasons, rather than the massive added cost of investors, lawyers, accountants, political lobbyists, and the sort of reactionary nut-jobs who make outrageously politicised claims. A common theme is that the only way a socialist country (meaning Stalin-era Communist Russia) can make the numbers work is to treat the Politburo - which we don't have - lavishly, while everyone else is euthanised if they so much as get a hangnail. This is not only laughably innaccurate, it is close to the way American healthcare actually works, where an ability to pay out of pocket bills in the millions gets the wealthy made well, while those who have to rely on health insurance are made paupers, or are condemned to die. As to the last part of the Question, about refusing to run endless tests, the NHS also has mental health responsibities. One of them is to ensure hypochondriacs don't deny people with physical illnesses treatment by monopolising all the available resources. Regrettably, in the past, many general practitioners worked on a ‘gut instinct’ belief-system, instead of the more modern, effective and humane science-based precautionary principal. PS My mum had multiple conditions, all real, but intractable, she was shamefully neglected in her final years. Obviously unwell, she was in and out of hospital for a decade until someone did some actual diagnostic tests but only a full decade too late for it to matter. That's why I applaud the bowel cancer screening and the many other specialist proactive initiatives that - not being left to an series of overworked GPs who much preferred patients with clear-cut conditions, typically treatable with a short course of pills, and with nice tidy positive clinical outcomes - can actually catch serious illness while they are still treatable."},{"instruction":"Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?","output":"Because the thought that events happen randomly, without human agency, terrifies them.

If events happen at random, we humans are powerless."},{"instruction":"f slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?","output":"It is still there There are perhaps as many and more people living under slavery-type conditions as there ever were The real question is what makes you think it ever ended, when really it just altered its manifestation. That is why antislavery legislation is so important at every level of government, and why it should be written into trade treaties Americans are the most resistant to one crucial realisation, and that is understanding the direction the anti slavery movement took after its initial successes. It looked more closely at economic, political and social power structures, and at the master-servant as well as the master-slave relationship. In those years of the industrial revolution it saw the children working, often in pitch darkness in the mines. It saw them crippled in factories, women forced by economic circumstance to slave away in factories for long hours, even when heavily pregnant. It saw the evils of class structures in society, and drew the connection between a home police state and an overseas colony Sometimes working people recognised it too - Lancashire cotton workers refused to handle cotton from slave states, despite loss of earnings to themselves The antislavery movement led to Trade Unionism, and to concepts of social democracy and representative democracy. Democracy never really evolved from a Greek ideal - It failed to do that in well over two thousand years. Democracy as we know, and strive for it, was the product of compassionate realisation that slavery was a sin against Humanity that degrades the overseer, far more than the slave, even in the eyes of whatever God. The American fear of “Socialism” is really the slave owners fear of emancipation - of loss of privilege, and the delusion of personal superiority Slavery was not abolished in 1865 the process of dismantling it continues to this day….Think what you are voting for wherever you are and in whatever country…"},{"instruction":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","output":"Hi All, Out of personal and professional interest, I have searched a great many top-notch sources with regard to the best visualizations on the topics of climate change, climate crisis, and climate risk.

But to write off gaming as a whole as hitting a point in diminishing returns completely ignores the indie developers and those outside the triple A market, as well as the few franchises and companies that stay true to their form (like for example, how Monster Hunter: World gave us a refined Monster Hunter experience, with frequent *free* DLC updates, which makes that particular game very much worth your money even when it’s already more than a year old as of writing).

Jesus told them, neither the blind man or his parents sinned but he was left that way for that very moment so that when Jesus healed him it would bring glory to God.Luke 13 Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish Absolutely yes. If you just need to feel better, get everything that might makes you more sad or depressed AWAY, and everyone who puts your issues on the spot as well! listening to sad music, talking to the wrong people about what makes you feel really sad, going to places that are related to bad memories, all of that can make your depression worse. Talk it out man! Write down everything. Whatever are your feelings ACCEPT them, see and understand what is their purpose and why do you feel this way! find a way out of it. Help yourself. Talk to new, fresh people. Go to new places. Try new clothes with new colours. Discover yourself again. Put your hand on heart, feel that heartbeat, and be grateful for it. Believe me if you give up to depression it will eat your soul. Whatever your age, you have a great life, you just can't see that well. And it's just a decision, remember that. You're the one who decides whether to be sad and let depression mess with you or to change something and get your life in a good, bright direction.What are you trying to clone. Cloning a lot of plants is very easy, you can take a cutting, place it in some compost an the cutting will develop roots. you now have two genetically identical plants.With some plants like most berries or vines it is even easier, just peg a part of the plant onto the ground and it will develop roots. Once it is rooted you can simply cut the vine connecting the new plant to the old.With mammals things are more difficult, you need some basic lab equipment. Basically you have to remove the nucleus (all the genetic material) from an egg cell and replace it with a cell nucleus taken from the animal you wish to clone, fuse the two together with a electric shock and then implant the clone embryo into the womb of a female animal so that it can develop to maturity.If you are trying to clone a hard disk, use a linux boot disk and a program called gparted"},{"instruction":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","output":"A true friend is hard to come by, and it takes time to determine if they are a true friend or not.

So X is nephrologist ( kidney/ dialysis doctor) . He works at private hospital and is very money minded and greedy. He is new inexperienced doctor . Many villagers used to visit him . Since this people are naive and didn't have much knowledge about all this things they visited him unknown to the fact that he was inexperienced. He used to give them medicines of high dose . So the patients who don't have kidney failure and just some mild problems . After taking this high dose their kidney started affecting and get failed eventually. And he suceed ,now they all have become permanent patient of this doctor . He done this things with many patients ( he is one of jholachap doctor who become doctor bcz of money). And when patients came to know about the truth they complained it to hospital authorities and this doctor 'X ’ ran away. After some years we came to know about that his wife who is also a doctor gave birth to baby . The baby was handicapped and have many problems and died after 3–4 months. Also his wife has got into a big accident . This is the result of karma . He give pain to many patients. There kidney was fine but he give such medicine which will automatically fail their kidney. A very close person of mine also suffered this . Thats why I give him many baddua similarly many people also give him. This is the result of baddua and Karma !!

Focus should be there for allievate poverty and increasing employment opportunity. Right now India need to resort to basic roots of ancient economy. First thing is make sure everything is fair and square. For example now a days malls are popping up in every small town. It is very wonderful to malls to pop ups. But my issue is they undersale of price necessity items to destroy small shops in nearby. Malls can provide facilities or other amenities but underpricing essential good should be deemed as crime. Everytime a small shop go down it affect anyways more than 4 families. Monopolistic tendencies of economy will lead wide spread of poverty. W Another step whichever industry is behind or lagging in country, government should give atmost relaxation of taxes and laws. For example nambiar started bpl in 1960 to India hoping India to have electronic industry revolution as par with Japan and China. In kerala with trade union issue it forced to move to bangalore. It is still going through crisis in spite the product of bpl was top notch at once Inspite blame should on management, government too is responsible for this fiasco. Whether India may surpress China in number, but technological industries we are miles behind not just Japan and China, but countries like philphines and Bangladesh rapidly growing. So self sufficiency in every industry should focus of government of India. Also small scale industry little more rigidity is needed especially rural areas, because extreme competition in small stores make none profitable venture for all of them.(kind of old license raja can be implemented here) Also when economy is very bad state, then it stupid decision to increase tax. It will do more damage. Right thing to do is to decrease the tax. Reducing pension age to fifty is best thing to do, as after 50 productivity of old may be less and all it increase job opportunities of younger generation. All government enterprises which doesn't yield profit should be privatised iimmieditly Another is majority appreasment syndrome in business should be stopped. For example Private bus owners, theatre owners are becoming scapegoats because government want to appease the masses. So theatres and private owners are struggling in India. Their price determination should be loosen up. For farmers price for yield should cost plus fair profit, format. Minimum price should be 3 times yield of cost of farming expense. For example if farmer put 100 rs for production of his yield, he should get rupees 300 in his hand when his product leave from his farm. If any power is playing to manipulate the price to substantially reduce or increase such power should be dealt with extreme brutality."},{"instruction":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","output":"Got landed to this question randomly while I am travelling in an amazing company.

Catholics will tell you that there is a purgatory. Purgatory is a place where you go to become purged from your sins, so that you can enter Heaven. But their location of Purgatory is wrong. This Earth you are living on now is the real Purgatory. It is this life that is your proving ground before God. And so, you only have this life to purge yourself of your own sins. For the Bible states that once to death and then judgement. We also know that this world is Purgatory, because there is a constant war between the human flesh and the human spirit. The human spirit wants to live a Godly life in Jesus, and the human flesh wants to be ultimately selfish. The Bible contains several verses that discuss the testing and refining of believers. Here are a few key passages along with their interpretations: 1 Peter 1:6-7:\\"In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.\\" Interpretation: Believers are encouraged to rejoice in the midst of trials, as these trials serve a purpose. Through the testing of their faith, they can develop genuine and steadfast faith, which is more valuable than perishable gold. This refined faith will bring praise, glory, and honor to Jesus Christ when He is revealed.James 1:2-4:\\"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.\\" Interpretation: James instructs believers to view trials as opportunities for pure joy, recognizing that such testing of their faith leads to the development of perseverance. Through the process of enduring trials, believers can grow in maturity and become complete in their faith, lacking nothing that God desires for them.Psalm 66:10:\\"For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.\\" Interpretation: The psalmist acknowledges that God tests and refines His people, comparing it to the process of refining silver. Just as silver is purified through refining, God tests and purifies the hearts and lives of His people. This refining process shapes believers, removing impurities and bringing forth their true character.Proverbs 17:3:\\"The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.\\" Interpretation: This verse uses the imagery of refining silver and gold to illustrate how the Lord tests the hearts of people. Just as a crucible and a furnace are used to purify precious metals, God tests and examines the hearts of believers. Through these tests, God refines their hearts, purging impurities and revealing their true character. These verses emphasize the significance of trials and testing in the lives of believers. Through these refining processes, believers can develop genuine faith, perseverance, maturity, and a heart that is pleasing to God."},{"instruction":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","output":"Obviously Pakistani people's are gonna say that Pakistan is batter and Bangladeshi people's are gonna vote for Bangladesh… If u truly want to know u can visit both country… traveling cost would be much not here in Bangladesh anyway… as a Bangladeshi I'd welcome to come to my country… Bangladeshi people's are extremely friendly… now Bangladesh in one of top three fastest growing economy and and traveling to Bangladesh has never been more easter…"},{"instruction":"What will be the change in the expected cutoff of the SSC CGL 2019 as compared to the SSc CGL 2018 as there are less vacancies this time?","output":"I think vacancy will increase because some departments(cag auditor,assistant account officer etc) are yet to report vacant position.

When they reach a certain level of success, actors may choose to be “offer only,” which means they don't audition anymore. (I know several casting people who complain about actors sabotaging themselves by doing it too early in their careers.) Offer-only actors sometimes volunteer to audition if there's a role they really want that they're not being considered for. A screen test is an audition. Known actors may skip earlier audition stages like pre-reads and callbacks and go right to testing, but it's still part of the audition process. A lot of actors hate auditioning, but I’ve come to love it. For that few minutes, the role is mine. I find when I'm offered a role with no audition, I get nervous because there's no way to know if the director, producers, etc. like my take on the character.

Long answer: Another answer tried to compare the scenes of Natasha beating the crap out of Happy in Iron Man 2 with the Captain Marvel scene as if the two are the same, and the only reason Nat gets a pass is because of some double standard, and that everyone who hates the scene is somehow “overreacting”. The answer in question: [LINKED_TEXT: Vincent Baldy's answer to Why does everyone hate Captain Marvel for squeezing that guy’s hand? He was rude to her.] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-does-everyone-hate-Captain-Marvel-for-squeezing-that-guy-s-hand-He-was-rude-to-her/answer/Vincent-Baldy] But I say this is utter bullshit, and here’s why: The case for Nat: She got slightly caught off guard when Happy tried to teach her about “Rule #1: Never take your eyes off your opponent”. Her instincts kicked in, and she took Happy down. It was not a case of merely beating up a weaker opponent “because she could” or anything like that. Most of her missions involve gut-wrenching battles to the death. Everything she does is on a razor’s edge; the slightest mistake or miscalculation could mean the end of her. So if she’s in a boxing ring and sees a cheap shot headed her way that she wasn’t prepared for, can you honestly say that her actions were out of character, or even unwarranted to begin with? She was literally in a boxing ring, being taught about boxing by a guy who underestimated her, and who then forced her unconscious training and muscle memory to kick in. Nobody’s gonna scream “sexism” in such a situation. It also shows the audience one of her signature moves (the “wrap legs around head and do a spinny flippy thingie”), as it comes back again later on in the film: There’s nothing mean-spirited about it, it shows the audience some of the things they can expect to see from the character, and there’s no overtly obvious “girl power” bullshit involved. It’s just a good character building moment all around. The case against Captain Marvel: A biker in a poor part of town sees a young woman reading a map and offers her a ride while also doing what he thinks is a good attempt at flirting. He is rather annoying, and of course physically imposing, but otherwise has no importance to the story, and no connection to any of the characters beyond this one scene. A better way to go about it would be to simply have her say something like “No thanks, I think I’ve got the hang of this map now”, and then fly away. She’s powerful, he’s humbled, and all without anyone getting hurt or dealing with irreparable, lifelong mental, emotional, and physical trauma. Hell, he could have been a redeemable character that shows up in multiple films. Thanos: “And who are you?” “They call me……The Don.” (pulls out shotgun. Thanos begins to laugh) “And just what do you hope to accomplish with that child’s toy, little one?” (Don pulls the trigger, just as Captain Marvel blasts Thanos in the chest., The Don thinks the shotgun did all the work.) The Don: “American-made 12 gauge, you alien bastard!” But instead, she gives her same arrogant smirk as she simultaneously crushes and burns the man’s hand in broad daylight, robs him of his transportation, steals clothes from another store, endangers other drivers on the road, and all this after giving a line about “smiling” like some sort of karmic “burn”. And this after she herself literally invited the man in for a handshake, all for the sole purpose of torturing, robbing, and taunting him to his face. This isn’t some sparring match that went a little too far, this is terrorizing the local populace with your powers and then robbing them of their possessions, and then further endangering lives elsewhere just because you can and there’s no one who can stop you. You absolutely CANNOT compare these two scenes and act like Black Widow gets a pass and Captain Marvel doesn’t, and all because people are “overreacting”, apparently. The only way you could say these scenes were the same would be if Natasha got out of the ring after beating Happy, slapped Pepper around, kicked Tony in the dick, stole his armor, and then flew through several buildings on her way out, narrowly missing a chopper or two. Captain Marvel’s behavior is not only very overtly and obviously a “girl power” scene, but is done in such a horrendously mean-spirited and psychotic fashion as well. In every way that matters, the scene is like a perfect microcosm of not only everything people find wrong with the film and the character as a whole, but also a perfect example of the kind of crappy character building, weak and/or mean-spirited story telling, and undisguised political undertones that Marvel fans fear will permeate the MCU from now on. And then if you don’t like it you’re “overreacting”."},{"instruction":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","output":"Telegram has many channels which can help you through many Examination.

At the time, Amazon was already a dominant force in the e-commerce space, but the company had been struggling to break into the grocery market. By acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon was able to gain a foothold in the grocery industry, which is one of the largest retail markets in the world. The acquisition also gave Amazon access to Whole Foods' loyal customer base, which was made up of health-conscious, affluent shoppers. This allowed Amazon to expand its reach into a new demographic and attract new customers to its platform. Additionally, the acquisition allowed Amazon to leverage Whole Foods' physical stores as distribution centers for its online orders. This helped Amazon to improve its delivery times and reduce its shipping costs. Overall, the acquisition of Whole Foods was a shrewd and smart move by Jeff Bezos and Amazon.

If you have these, it's great, even otherwise, only thing you have in your control is your skills, you have few months and that isn't less to significantly upskill yourself. You would have to prepare for interviews, practice coding questions, and learn CS fundamentals. Most big product based companies won't focus on specific skills, they have standardized interview pattern, medium-hard coding questions, which depends on your inherent skills but preparation will be helpful, CS fundamentals, OS, DBMS, Networking, OOPs etc. These are totally possible to be learnt in few months, there is a huge luck factor but there isn't any limit to how many companies you can apply for, putting 100% efforts is in your control, if it doesn't work out, atleast you won't regret not trying and would definitely be a better and more skilled version of yourself."},{"instruction":"Why don't people do their homework and study it out to realize Obama is a communist?","output":"I don’t get why people on the right post such softball questions.

We were a live and let live town, we didn’t have racial issues, people were openly gay, we had hippies on motor cycles that hung out at Taco Bell, we had Hari Krishna’s dancing in the streets, and no one batted an eye. What’s going on in Southern California now, breaks my heart. The cost of living is off the charts, people are stressed out, the most important thing has become, how wealthy your family is.

So why does van Gaal do this? THE DECISIONPlanned in advance:This was not a decision that Louis van Gaal took in the last minute. It was something that was well planned out from before. Tim Krul was prepped by the goal keeping coach and was told that if the situation arose, he would have to take the place between the posts during the shootout. van Gaal hid this plan from Cillessen so that it would not damage his confidence or affect his game. CILLESSEN Cillessen was clearly unhappy about being substituted. He probably felt he wasn't believed in or was not a big fan of the fact that he wasn't informed in advance. However, he was seen passionately celebrating each Dutch penalty and also the saves that Krul made. He hopefully understood the genius behind the change. van Gaal made it a point to dispel any rumors of a change in the number one keeper for the rest of the tournament, claiming Cillessen remains his number one choice. THE ADVANTAGESRendered any prior Costa Rican preparation uselessIf the Costa Ricans had prepared for penalties, they would have studied Cillessen and his motions. However, in walked this other guy whom they did not research at all. He's very confident and is mouthing taunts at them. They have no idea who he is nor have they studied his motions. Also, it may have helped that Costa Rica had its previous game go to penalties. He probably observed how they approached that shootout. Surprise, bit**!When you are so surprised at such a critical stage of an important match, you feel outwitted. It's like preparing all night for one proof of a theorem or a topic for an examination because you are a 100% sure that it will be asked and then you find a 100 mark question on something you didn't study for at all. Even though you may still get it, your confidence is not high at all. DeceptionKrul is not a specialist at saving penalties. A record of 2 saves out of 20 is not the sign of a penalty specialist. But did the Costa Ricans know that? He sure looks like a penalty expert for all they know. Why would van Gaal bring him on otherwise? Clearly, a psychological decision and not a tactical one. Pressure and attention off his playersThis was THE MOST IMPORTANT reason as far as I'm concerned. As soon as van Gaal made the change, all the attention deflected from the kick takers to the decision he made. If Netherlands, who have a horrible record at penalty shootouts, had indeed lost, he would have been blamed for a ludicrous decision. No one expected anything from Tim Krul either. Thus, it was a sacrificial move, showing that he was ready to take the heat in case something went wrong. Penalty shootouts are won and lost very easily. It's about handling your nerves well. When the pressure was off the Dutch kick takers, their experience came to the fore. He sent his four most experienced kick takers (with Huntelaar probably in line to take the fifth) to ensure nervousness would play no role in the result of a spot kick. And then, something amazing happened. Four perfect penalties. Even the goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, who had such an amazing tournament and game and should have been coming into the shootout with great confidence, would have been slightly shaken by the sudden presence of the chatty Krul. The Dutch keeper dives the right way each time (5 out 5, saving two of them) after taunting the opposing kick takers into making mistakes. (His first save wasn't really extraordinary or anything.) This is probably the result of his studies of the kick takers from the previous shootout that Costa Rica took part in. The players may have had conflicts about whether they should stick to what worked for them last time or if they should do something fancy to beat this \\"penalty expert,\\" whose job was just to apparently find out which way they were going to go.

Assumption: Nuclear weapons would not be used. Short answer: No Already many have explained in their answers. Just because 2 or more countries join in a war, they are not assured of a victory. Because wars are won based on the objectives set, the way it is executed and the total resources used. I'm not sure how or what objectives are set by India and China - just to defeat USA? Defeat it, why? There has to be a strong purpose. We don't wage a war against a country for no reason, not for fun. There is no fun in a war. End result of a war is dependent on how it is executed. How will India and China coordinate among themselves. Will the two countries invade USA in their land? From where will each attack? Or will they defend an attack from USA in Asia? The latter is not desirable for India and China as huge size of their populations will be killed. The former is extremely difficult to accomplish. Resources for war: Others have detailed how USA is far more equipped in terms of weapons and war equipments to fight than many countries including China and India. And you mention in 2015 or 2016. Both of us combined are nowhere near USA in military resources. We only have far too many soldiers and USA can fight it in a manner convert the numbers to our disadvantage in the war. USA cannot defeat China and India and occupy the countries. But USA can inflict a huge damage on us. Let me end it with an example. Israel fought its wars against a coalition of Arab countries and defeated them all (Ex. Wars of 1967, 1973).

Most words can be classified as general usage and do not need to be commented on. The problem is that the words can have different uses, some general and some slang. If it's slang you need to be aware of it as it can be vulgar. For example if the word has one star it can be used in most informal situations by educated speakers. If the word has two stars it is used by most educated speakers but not in all situations. Care needs to be taken so as not to offend even though the word may be fine between friends. If it has three stars it is very vulgar and should be avoided by speakers of English as a foreign language. Also learn the symbols for literary words which are often found in literature but which are rarely used in spoken form. Finally you have archaic and old-fashioned words that you may find in print, usually for humor but which you rarely hear in daily conversation.Another thing to note are the words used in dialects and in smaller regions. They are regionalisms and may not always be understood outside that region."},{"instruction":"Why does noisecancelling headphones cause headache?","output":"Hi there! Great question! Some people do report experiencing headaches after using over-ear noise-canceling headphones, but it's important to note that these are not inherently headache-inducing for everyone. The cause of these headaches can vary between individuals and depend on several factors, including: Pressure Sensation: Over-ear noise-canceling headphones, particularly those with active noise cancellation (ANC), work by creating a kind of 'sound vacuum' which can sometimes give a sensation of pressure, similar to being in a fast-elevating elevator or airplane. Some people may be more sensitive to this sensation, which can potentially lead to discomfort or headaches.Improper Fit: If your headphones are too tight or not correctly adjusted, they can put excessive pressure on your ears and the sides of your head, which can cause headaches after prolonged use. Always make sure your headphones fit comfortably!Prolonged Use: Using any headphones, not just over-ear noise-canceling headphones, for extended periods can lead to fatigue and strain, which might result in a headache. It's always a good idea to take regular breaks to rest your ears.Volume Levels: Listening to audio at high volumes can not only be damaging to your hearing but can also cause headaches. The beauty of over-ear noise-canceling headphones is that you can listen to your content at lower volumes, thanks to the reduced background noise. If you're experiencing headaches after using over-ear noise-canceling headphones, it might be worth trying different brands or models, adjusting the fit, or taking more frequent breaks during use. If discomfort continues, you may want to consult a medical professional to ensure there isn't an underlying issue causing the headaches. Remember, everyone's experiences with headphones can be unique, and what might cause discomfort for one person might not for another. Hope this helps! Happy listening!

RETURN VALUE On success, these functions return the number of input items successfully matched and assigned; this can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early matching failure. The value EOF is returned if the end of input is reached before either the first successful conversion or a matching failure occurs. EOF is also returned if a read error occurs. In your case, the statement “scanf (\\"%d\\", a)” is wrong and will result in undefined behavior mostly “segmentation fault”. As you have missed ampersand “&” before variable a and b. So correct statement would be like below int a,b; if (scanf (\\"%d\\",&a) == scanf (\\"%d\\",&b)) {} scanf returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned. here in the above case, scanf may return 0 or 1 depending on what inputs are given to the variables. Just take below examples to understand. int ret = scanf(“%d %d”, &a, &b); It will return 2 if both the inputs are integers. Here, successfully matching and assigned values are applicable for both the variables so the return value is 2.It will return 1 if the first input is an integer but the second one is not an integer. “%d” expects integer value. Here, successfully matching and assigned value is only applied to the first variable so the return value is 1.It will return 0 if both the inputs are not the integer value. Here, successfully matching and assigned value is applied to none.It will return 0 if the first input is noninteger and the second one is an integer value. Since first input itself is wrong so it won't go for reading another variable. The answer to your question, we can do the comparison as scanf returns some value. In the end, we gonna compare the values. But what will happen if you compare the function whose return type is void? I leave it to you guys to figure it out."},{"instruction":"What do you think would happen if a tourist would walk with a Nazi flag in Jerusalem?","output":"Why don’t you give it a try, and then come back and let us know how you got on.

GOLD! I FOUND GOLD!” shouted Francisco Lopez, a native Californian in early 1842. Francisco couldn't believe his luck. He wanted more! He looked around the river. “Wow! More gold!” He moved some rocks and found even more. “There’s gold everywhere!” he jumped up and down with excitement. He became a millionaire in a few weeks. Francisco is recognized as one of the first people to find gold in Northern California. The word spread slowly at first. Then, a few years later, a San Francisco newspaper confirmed the opportunity and the word spread like wildfire. By 1849, the news had spread around the world. An overwhelming number of gold-seekers began to arrive from every continent. The famous name \\"forty-niners\\" originated from the approximately 90,000 people who arrived in California during this year, 1849. Once the news spread, everything happened very quickly. There was no easy way to get to California. Forty-niners faced hardship and often death on their way to get there. Almost overnight, opportunities became abundant everywhere. — Now, to answer your question, what are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast? During the California Gold Rush, there were two types of people: Those who wanted to get rich quick and those who were in for the long run. Those who wanted to strike it rich quickly, were searching for a shortcut. They lacked patience, were highly emotional dreamers who lacked discipline. These people were basically gambling with their lives. Hoping and wishing for the good luck to strike it rich in a few days. On the other hand, those who wanted to get rich slowly were completely opposed to the shortcut seekers. They knew what they wanted. They were searching for long-term opportunities, not after an emotional dream. These men were smart. They were NOT distracted, going after the “gold-gamble,” they were entrepreneurs who were there to make a huge business out of the gold that everyone else was after. These entrepreneurs got into shipping to transport people and supply goods for the growing population. They built hotels, restaurants, sold the tools needed for miners. Hundreds of ships were abandoned after their crews deserted them right after they got to land. Gold diggers would run as fast as possible to the goldfields to start searching for the precious metal. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs were known to convert these boats into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and even into jails. Opportunities were massive. While the “get rich quick” gold diggers were risking their lives in the mountains, the unending demand of needs raised the prices of all the goods to unimaginable levels. There are reports of bakeries charging one dollar for a slice of bread, two dollars if it was buttered, the equivalent of about 56 in today’s money. A dozen eggs might cost you 90 at today’s prices. A pick axe would cost the equivalent of 1,500! Coffee 1,200 a pound and a pair of boots up to 3,000! Two famous examples of slow-growth entrepreneurs who bloomed in this era are: - Levi Strauss, founder of the American clothing company who supplied jeans to the miners. Think about this, where are all the gold diggers? GONE! Where is Levi Strauss & Co. 165 years later? Correct! - Henry Wells and William Fargo started a transportation business in 1852. Later, they found the opportunity to get into financial services. In 1954, Wells Fargo & Union Trust shortened its name to Wells Fargo Bank. Tell me, where are the gold diggers today? Don't get distracted by gold’s glitter! Slow, smart, hard work is by far the best way to succeed!"},{"instruction":"Can you ever take out a loan with bad credit?","output":"af247 dot com"},{"instruction":"w do you get a name changed on a birth certificate?

That obese usually comes with health problems. Sleep apnea is common. High blood pressure is common. Endurance is not good. Physical activity is hard. Joints hurt. Diabetes can occur. These all sometimes show up later in life but sometimes even young people can have these problems. They are not fun. The lack of physical activity can take a toll on one’s happiness, when you can’t go hiking with your kids, for example, or skiing, or just about any kind of outdoor activity. It’s tough. And yet, it is so very hard to overcome the desire to eat, and to face what seems like an unendurable and impossible lengthy period of deprivation to lose weight when you have a hundred pounds to lose.

In time of old in the Netherlands bricklayers who wanted to “graduate” as masters typically had to create a ‘masterwork’ before the local guild would recognize them as such. The work usually consisted of decorative work on gables, portals to alleys or simple displays of skill. The emphasis as far as I can tell would have been on shaping or cutting bricks, constructing decorative arches and making sure the mortar joints were as thin as possible. I reckon the last point might seem strange to many modern day people but it does demonstrate a skill in shaping. If you take the above as a sort of bottom line for what bricklaying entails than I would say it’s not simple as all. Then again we can also look at the decorative skills necessary for other traditional trades such as carpentry and dredge equally impressive examples.

Of course, this is impossible. There are insufficient votes. A next step would be to show that the number of cases of use of firearms for protection is vastly outnumbered by criminal use causing harm. However, this is not factual. Use for self protection is larger. Alternately, you could make the case that police arrive everywhere they are summoned instantaneously, everywhere in the USA. Therefore police can always protect you. But, this is not true. ‘Most especially in rural areas. Alternately, you could argue that people have no right to protect themselves from harm. You could offer that any person can now approach an elite, or an official, or your daughter, and throw them down and rape them then kill them. This is unlikely, the move to limit guns is actually a move to solidify control of others.

The fact as another writer has noted already, is that “fiscal responsibility” is the phrase they use to justify tax cuts for the rich, while simultaneously telling us that it would be “irresponsible” to raise taxes to deal with the deficits created by the tax cuts themselves. Doesn’t make a bit of sense, does it, to cut taxes, create a deficit, and then refuse to raise taxes to fix the problem? But we are a nation of the economically ignorant. We’ve been falling for this fraud for almost 40 years now. Economics is not rocket science. The only reason it seems that way to many of us, is because the “explanations” required to get us to accept the tax cut fraud, must be so complex, that they replace basic common sense with either a “belief” in some fairy tale nonsense, or so much confusion that the public can’t grasp the problem sufficiently to do anything about it. The process is simple. Tax cuts result in LESS TAX REVENUE!!!!! When the government doesn’t collect enough in taxes to pay for its obligations, this creates A DEFICIT. When the fiscally “responsible” Republicans then refuse to reverse the tax cut to address the deficit the tax cut created, the money is borrowed which INCREASES THE NATIONAL DEBT. In other words, the “fiscally responsible” Republicans borrow money from the Working Class, to pay for the tax cuts for the rich and the corporations. Then the rich and the corporations lend us, the Working Class, the money they just got in tax cuts, to pay for the deficit created by the tax cuts!!! The swindle is astonishingly easy to see. The fraud is incredibly enormous. But we never seem to catch on."},{"instruction":"w do Democrats explain the peerreviewed paper on the 4 hidden algorithms found in the NY voter rolls using multiple obfuscation techniques built into the system?","output":"The same way we try to explain unicorn invasions and the ‘'DEEP STATE\\" to people who believe that kind of nonsense…but reality is remarkably ineffective on the particular populace!"},{"instruction":"What makes some people look better than others when they wear their baseball cap back to front?","output":"I'm a fan of ball caps.

A single assassin is better than a dozen serial killers, a children molester is much better than a sadistic rapist especially when the latter is a stooge of a totalitarian regime. Quite few issues moved along to abetter status once these dictators were ousted but the negative issues imported had been much uglier and far more than those, both horizontally and vertically ( quantity and quality, respectively). Besides, and let me focus on my own case as an Iraqis fellow, a dictator like Saddam regarded Iraq as if his own property, this urged him to build Iraq thinking that the credit would always be his, the stooges that succeeded him are a bunch of dual citizenship and Iranian homage agents whose only target had always been to rob Iraq of any resources. They spread sectarian killing while Saddam cared to curb any sectarian affiliation, no Sunni no Shiite, he wanted Iraqis to be Ba’thists, partisans like his own case but he never encouraged Iraqis to kill each other. Also, not one single neighboring country ever thought of offending Iraq, not Iran, not Kuwait, not Syria. Once Saddam and his regime (and party) were ousted, all of these countries played a vicious role destroying Iraq. Even Alqaeda and ISIS, they could never have been there while that regime was strong. Now we can best evaluate the barbarian assault of USA in 2003 and fathom its consequences whether for Iraqis or the for the whole world."},{"instruction":"Could Dormammu defeat Ultron from What if?","output":"I’m going with Ultron here First off, The Watcher has seen all, knows all, and everything that could happen Meaning he knows about Dormammu and what he has done and how strong he is He has never seen anything like Ultron before and couldn’t imagine what he could do.

Who's to blame?","output":"Michael Jordan was the most talented player in the draft that year. The two teams that picked ahead of the Bulls were teams that needed centers, so that’s why he didn’t get picked #1. Dean Smith’s UNC Tar Heels played team basketball and that limited Jordan offensively. Smith admitted he didn’t unleash MJ offensively (17 points a game for his three years at North Carolina), but he said that he didn’t limit him defensively. I could see in his third and last year at UNC that the NBA game was going to be where he shined the brightest and he did. In his second season, he broke his foot and was out 64 games. I can’t put my finger on it, but when he came back from that injury is when he took off like a shot out of a canyon. There was this one college football punter back in the 1970’s who broke his leg or foot when he was just an average punter. After he was healed from his injury, he shot out of a cannon and was one of the best punters of the decade. He was booming long punts and became his team’s long field goal specialist, trying FG’s up to 60 yards when the team desperately needed points late in the first half or at the end of the game. Jordan would’ve been great regardless, but him healing from a broken foot and him fighting with management to get back on the floor (and squabbling with mgt. seemingly all the time), might’ve made him physically and mentally stronger and more motivated to become one of the best players of all-time."},{"instruction":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works?

What is the direction of the storyline?","output":"Answer contains ***SPOILERS*** and Photos are screenshots Yes, ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ does make a point. Love can exist in triangles, which holds you to certain inescapable situations. Someone in the triangle has to be the one to let go. ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ is written using one of the great historic Musical love triangles as a pattern. Brahms was a musical student under the great German composer Robert Schumann. Brahms fell in love with Schumann’s wife Clara. But did not act on it, seemingly until after the death of Schumann. Interestingly, when finally freed to explore a relationship with Clara, Brahms withdrew. In ‘Do You Like Brahms’, there are three Brahms Love Triangles. Each has to be worked out to a conclusion. Unlike in the real event with Brahms, the writer wanted a conclusion to the love affair. Love Triangle # 1 This is the main love triangle between a gifted Pianist, Park Joon-young, his best friend (Cellist Han Hyun-ho) and Han Hyun-ho’s girlfriend, Violinist Lee Jung-kyung. The gifted pianist Park Joon-young strongly loved Violinist Lee Jung-kyung, but never acted on it because of his friendship with Cellist Han Hyun-ho. In the end, the girlfriend fell in love with Park Joon-young, but his loyalty to his friend made him decide to break free from this love triangle. He withdrew. Love Triangle # 2 Business Major Chae Song-ah made a life direction change late in life. At the age of 29, she decided to pursue Music as a career. The one who got her started and acted as her teacher was Yoon Dong-yoon, a gifted violinist, who lost his love of playing the Violin. Chae Song-ah developed a love for Yoon Dong-yoon, but did not act upon this emotion, because her best friend (Kang Min-sung) was madly in love with Yoon Dong-yoon. Yoon Dong-yoon comes to love Chae Song-ah, however, she withdraws from this triangle. Love Triangle # 3 Having both broken free from dead-end love triangles, Violinist Chae Song-ah and the gifted Pianist Park Joon-young connect. Through a slow build of trust, the two fall in love. However, ever lingering in the background are those from both Triangles who are hotly pursuing their lost loves. This virtually makes the Love Triangle a Love Quadrangle. Lee Jung-kyung heavily pursues Park Joon-young and Yoon Dong-yoon heavily pursues Chae Song-ah. ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ The answer to that question from Park Joon-young was always no. The music (and maybe the history) of Brahms was a constant reminder of his love for Lee Jung-kyung, which took forever to shake. When Park Joon-young finally did break free, he could give his love to Chae Song-ah, who also finally breaks free of her Love Triangle. When these two finally got together and Park Joon-young expresses his love for Chae Song-ah, that scene is dramatic and cathartic. Breaking free of the Brahms Triangle, once again Park Joon-young could play Brahms again, as he expresses his love for Chae Song-ah through music written by Brahms. ‘Do You Like Brahms?’ was written by Ryu Bo-ri [LINKED_TEXT: Musical Love Triangle: Brahms & the Schumanns - Houston SymphonyThe Houston Symphony’s signature event of the 2019–20 season, Schumann Festival: Angels and Demons celebrates German composer Robert Schumann (1810–1856).

This lifeform fused with a human to create the Power of Titans. Titans have been theorised to have the Sun’s light as an energy source since they become inactive after the Sun falls. This is indicative of a plant-based lifeform (e.g. tree), however, a Titan is also very mobile and can move swiftly, indicative of an animal-based lifeform. Now, I should point out that the Titans’ energy source being the Sun’s light has several flaws, which is expected as it’s only a theory and not a proven fact. Firstly, there have been multiple instances of Titans maintaining activity in the night (as shown in Season 2, Season 3 and in Season 4). This was countered with the response that they are using the light reflected off of the moon. Again, this was a theory and not a proven fact. There are severe flaws with gaining energy from the light from the moon, but I’ll let those pass. The other point is that if Titans are like plants then the reaction that they use to intake sunlight does not provide them with energy. A large misconception people have about plants is that photosynthesis provides them with energy, and the truth is that it does not. It produces glucose which plants then use in respiration in the night to gain energy. Yes, plants respire like humans and other animals. So if Titans were like plants, then they should be inactive during the day and active during the night since the light they intake does not release energy but should make glucose which is used in the night to release energy. For a person who has established their love for science, I am surprised Hange did not see the flaws in the theory that Titans gain energy from the Sun. I actually came up with a more plausible idea: Titans become inactive during the night to maintain their brain function like humans do. We sleep because if we don’t, our cognitive functions (senses and memory) will become impaired and unable to work. This makes sense because Titans also use their senses like we do; they use their eyes to see, ears to hear, etc (the organs aren’t just there for show). As for the energy, it’s reasonable that the Titans’ energy originates from the Paths. Or Titans do use the Sun as an energy source, but sleep because they need to. Going back to the Source of All Life, it provides the Eldian Race with a host of godlike abilities. Here is a hypothesis: After Ymir’s passing, her three daughters inherited the Titan power. From observing the similarities between the Nine Titans (like the warhammer to the armoured, cart to the jaw, etc), people have grouped three Titan powers in each daughter. A theory I came up with is that each Titan represents a stage of a living being’s evolution. Evolution is the process by which we evolve through the modification of our genes which leads to an enhancement in physical structure. How does this relate to the question? The hallucigenia-like being/the Source of All Living Matter may be an extremely evolved being that reached a higher dimension through long-lasting, extensive evolution. I’ll elaborate: -The Monstrous Titan: Aggregate of the Jaw, Cart and Beast Titans. It has malformations and takes on animalistic characteristics. This is the earliest stage of evolution for life, with each being adapted to thrive in different environments. As a result, this Titan is the weakest of all Titans. -The Moulding Titan: Aggregate of the Armoured, Colossal and Warhammer Titans. In contrast to the Monstrous Titan, this Titan represents the peak of evolution for physical/material/observable life (I’ll explain this observable and unobservable stuff later). It can change its own body composition, hinting at a superior lifeform because of its ability to modify its genes and body at will, rather than having to go through evolution to do so. This Titan represents the final stage of evolution for life forms that are exempt of the transcendence of conepts(e.g space and time). It can change its mass since it has Titans of varying masses (Colossal and Armoured/Warhammer). Most interestingly, it may be able to create entirely new forms of matter e.g. iceburst and glowing stone. -The Principle Titan: Aggregate of the Attack, Female and Founding Titans. Most powerful Titan in existence, being able to tap into the original Founder Ymir’s power via the Paths. It can control time as well as conjure powers that transcend time and space. It represents the very last stage of evolution for life, where the being transcends abstract concepts like time, space, life and death. In fact, being able to exist beyond the three spatial dimensions(1D, 2D, 3D) and one temporal dimension (4D) gives the being the ability to hinder with and even ignore physics as shown when Titans are able to exert a massive force despite being so light and mostly devoid of mass without even having nearly enough acceleration to justify said force. Having ascended, the Titan has all the abilities of the Moulding Titan and more, such as: clairvoyance, precognition and control over time and space. It also can enter a plane in a higher dimension (Paths). Now, the body composition and matter creation techniques are not possessed by the Colossal, Armoured or Warhammer Titans but this is only a theory. Apart from the Founder, no other a Titan has been said to have these abilities. However, the theory is still understandable since the Founding Titan has its own host of abilities separate to the ability to enter the Paths and command Ymir, which is when they have all Titan powers. These powers include: memory manipulation, clairvoyance and Titan control as when demonstrated, the user(s) did not need to go to the Paths. The body manipulation is different; the Founder can’t do it unless they go to the Paths to control Ymir (the First Titan who has all Titan powers) which suggests that the biological manipulation may not be an ability the Founder independently possesses (/ can use without going to the Paths) which implies that it belongs to another Titan. It may be the case that after an Eldian gains all three Titans (Warhammer, Armoured and Colossal) it may gain the abilities to mould different forms of matter and change its biology. The Power of Titans even being able to create iceburst is widely unknown to lots of fans, even though Zeke said that it was the King of Titans. This was again a part of what he heard, but, Rod Reiss supporting his statement by saying the glowing stones were made by the Power of Titans and the almost-magical properties of iceburst just scream Titan powers. Again these are said to the be the Founder’s powers, however, it just seems more realistic for the Moulding Titan being able to do this. So that’s the hallucigenia, or Source of All Living Matter, and all it’s abilities in Attack on Titan. Again, this is just a theory of an answer. Edit: I just found out about Attack on Titan: Before the Fall. Its an official prequel to Attack on Titan and is considered canon. In the story, we are given insights on the creation of ODM gear which also includes the discovery of iceburst and ultra-hard steel. Iceburst was said to be deposited there by the First King, mirroring Zeke’s description of the origin of iceburst. Then there is ultra-hard steel, the steel was actually made from an iron bamboo shoot that absorbed metals from the Earth to make itself stronger. Presumably, the plant was also made by the Power of Titans and further supports the idea that the Power of Titans can create different forms of matter. Also, multiple Pure Titans were shown to have been moving during the night."},{"instruction":"Do you believe in karma?

Is this trademarked, paid program for real, or are they piggybacking on the general meditation trend?","output":"In 1973 (long before the current meditation trend existed) someone pointed out a picture of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on a poster advertising a Transcendental Meditation lecture, and asked me what I thought of him. I looked at that handsome Indian face with its radiant smile and guileless eyes and just thought no one could be that perfect. I waved my hand dismissively and snorted, “too good to be true.” A year later, having forgotten this, I was introduced to TM by a different route (after yelling at them for charging money). By then I’d had a spiritual experience that had told me what to look for; TM met all the requirements, so I was a tiny bit more humble. Now, 45 years later, I consider learning TM to have been the the single most valuable decision I made in life. Because of TM I calculate I have lived at least twice as long as I would have without it; I’m many times over healthier, happier, wealthier, wiser and more spiritually awakened. Now I understand that what I saw in that first photo was a purity I’d come to believe didn’t exist. Like you, I’d seen that life was full of a lot of slick advertising schemes and everyone out for a buck, full of scams that I wasn't going to get caught up in. But it wasn’t a scam. Maharishi’s Transcendental Meditation did everything the Intro lecture claimed it would, and much, much more—and now I understand why I was so suspicious. It is because TM and all of Maharishi’s 40 systems for perfect health are the most polished, most professional programs you’ll find anywhere. The TM organization is a very tight ship, run by a lot of dedicated teachers who are willing to submit to a lot of rules and regulations that Maharishi put in place in order to make sure that you and everyone else get exactly the right training in how to do this phenomenal meditation technique, to insure that you get exactly the right start to your journey to better health, wealth, and happiness. Sometimes people are like I was—suspicious. They get a whiff of that polish and the only thing they can compare it to is a really slick scam because what is there in life that is as good, as real, as true, as solid as TM and other of Maharishi programs? Here are some facts. The reason that TM is trademarked is NOT to grab money from its earnings but to preserve its purity and to protect you from those who claim to teach something “just as good.” Only the authentic Transcendental Meditation program can legally capitalize the name. This insures that the teachings you get from the TM people are the teachings Maharishi taught, and that it is the exactly the same technique that is so successful in scientific research.Charging money turned out to be another stroke of Maharishi’s genius. It funded people to teach TM, do research, pay for worldwide travel to promote it, pay for education programs to help people understand the value of meditation and living in accord with the laws of nature, pay for books and buildings for further education and research. Equally importantly, the charges were a means of keeping people meditating long enough to see the benefits, because you are more likely to value what has cost you something. But the charges aren’t for profit. The worldwide TM organization is an official non-profit educational program.Maharishi’s photos are everywhere on legitimate TM documents and websites not because it is a cult but because it is your guarantee that you are getting the authentic knowledge and authentic facts instead of some knock-off calling itself transcendental meditation.Transcendental Meditation comes with a money-back guarantee. It can offer this because TM works. Research shows that brain changes begin from the very first meditation. Over 600 research studies provide evidence that it works.In research studies that compare meditation techniques, TM is consistently in first place for effectiveness.Like other responders to this question have pointed out, after successfully overcoming religious fears that it might be some kind of Eastern mind-control cult, TM and its research proved the value of meditation. It was actually what awakened interest in meditation in the West. Other meditation techniques either came from traditions that almost no one had heard of up to that point, or were knock-offs. Also, TM isn’t mind-control. It is a fully natural, mechanical technique that is learned in a four-day, 1-to-1 1/2 hour-a-day course. Then, just like having learned where the light switch is, you own it.The Transcendental Meditation program has been taught around the world for more than 60 years in many reputable places, including schools, hospitals, and even in the military, where it is the most successful program for treating PTSD. In research conducted by the American Heart Association, it was found to be the only meditation technique that reduced blood pressure. For this and other reasons, you would be wise to trust that it isn’t a scam, but even so, read the research and ask good questions of TM teachers. (I am not a TM teacher and I get no money for writing about it. I write about it out of gratitude and compassion.) The final proof can only come from direct experience.

(Muscle mass is important for rugby as protection for joints and strength but it is not necessary to look like a body builder. Slightly different examples are weight lifters and Sumo wrestlers who need body mass rather than a sculpted physique.) To return to the rugby player, he spent a lot of time in the gym working on weights but he spent even more time running and doing aerobic exercise. He ran at least 10 kilometres everyday, often twice that and did sprints. He could, and did, run marathons in around 2.5 hours. He was superbly fit aerobically but his body never had any spare energy to build muscle mass. He also had no spare fat. I think his fat percentages were around 6%, which is too low. You actually need fat for a number of bodily functions and as a source of energy for aerobic exercise. The other thing to note is that muscle bulk is achieved by hypertrophy of the muscles, increasing the size of the muscle cells. It may also entail a small layer of fat around the muscle particularly in the building muscle phase. If a lot of aerobic exercise is undertaken then hypertrophy is less likely to occur and fat percentages will be lower. Meaning muscles tend not to bulk as much as they would with less aerobic exercise. I should note that, elite body builders working towards a competition aim to reduce fat to increase muscle definition and they get down to very low levels but in the muscle building phase they need more fat."},{"instruction":"Currently, what is the most efficient renewable energy source?","output":"Hi, . . .

One significant example that comes to mind, though, is the approach used by the business Apple when it entered the mobile phone industry in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone. Companies like Nokia and BlackBerry, who largely focused on selling mobile phones as communication devices, at the time dominated the market for mobile phones. On the other side, Apple promoted the iPhone as a ground-breaking product that merged a phone's capability with a computer's features while being simple to use. Additionally, they developed an environment with apps, music, movies, and books that attracted repeat customers. With the aid of this tactic, Apple was able to quickly gain market share and solidify its position as a significant player in the mobile phone sector. This was viewed as a clever and cunning move since it allowed Apple to stand out from its rivals and appeal to a larger market.

Nobody from other countries think that. Quite the contrary. Here is a comparison between USA and Norway as an example of why: USA 41% of the US population cannot afford health care, about 66% of those who can afford it, report that they are very, somewhat or a little concerned they won't be able to afford medical care in any given year, and more than 90% feel they don’t get their money’s worth. The average annual cost of health insurance in the USA is US 7 739 for an individual and US 22 221 for a family. Even when the employer offers insurance plans, the employee will still have to pay an average US 1 260 annually. Generally not covered in the US Any dental work, congenital external defects, convalescence, venereal disease, general debility, use of intoxicating drugs/alcohol, self-inflicted injuries, AIDS, diagnosis expenses, infertility treatment, and more are in general not covered by health insurances in the US. Generally also not covered are complications arising due to diseases you may have had before taking the policy, such as high blood pressure, asthma, or diabetes. Other things generally not covered are pregnancy, abortion, diagnostic charges, and specific medical conditions such as cataract, hernia, calculus diseases, gall bladder removal, hydrocele, sinusitis, joint replacement, piles, fistula in anus, benign prostatic hypertrophy and other age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, etc. An ambulance ride in the US can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars out of pocket, even with insurance. Additional costs are common. Norway In Norway 0% - that is zero percent - cannot afford heath care, and very few have any complains about the care they get. The average annual cost of health insurance in Norway is NoK 0 - that is, zero - and the annual cost per person for health care beyond that, necessary prescriptions included, is max. NoK 2 921 which equals US 293. The fee also covers travels by any means - private car, taxi, bus, train, plane - to the clinic or hospital where you receive treatment. In case you didn’t understand: as soon as you reach the annual max. of 293 dollars, travels to the hospital are in general covered or reimbursed. Ambulance rides in Norway are always covered. No additional costs at any point. Generally not covered in Norway Regular dental work after the age of 18, but we are working on it. Would any Norwegian think the US healthcare system is “so great”? I mean, would you rather pay almost eight thousand dollars a year for almost nothing or three hundred that covers basically everything?

They commissioned architects to model a skyscraper with a fire in the upper floors. No fire equipment was that tall and sprinkler systems couldn’t pump water that high fast enough to put the fire out so in 20 min the floors and furniture burn well enough to raise the temperature of the floor above to 2000f. The pre stress cables in the concrete floors expand and start to melt. When the upper floor falls it easily breaks the cables in the overheated floor below and no floor can support two falling floors much less all the floors above it. Their report made it clear that when a skyscraper gets a burning floor that you get all fire fighters out starting at 12 min. And spend all time getting people out of the building. At the time of the twin towers many years later not one of the recommendations from the report had been implemented. The plane crash behaved exactly as predicted in the report. 20 min after the crash the fire heated the ceiling floor to failure and we saw the wind push the walls outward as the stack of floors fall to the basement unimpeded by the floors below."},{"instruction":"What is the best browser compatibility testing tool?","output":"BrowserStackBrowsershotsBrowserlingLitmusIE NetRendererBrowser SandboxTestingBotBrowseEmAll"},{"instruction":"F John Bonham never died in 1980, Led Zeppelin stayed together, The Beatles never broke up, and none of them died, do you think that the Music industry would be different today? Who do you think would be bigger?","output":"The Beatles didn’t just change music… they changed the world. If they’d stayed together, and none of the members had passed on, it’s impossible to say what music they might have created. It’s hard to imagine they could have kept up the pace of their creative output throughout the 60s. By the end of the decade, it seemed evident that they were all ready to strike out on their own. So, even if the band would have remained a unit, John, Paul, and George probably would still have pursued solo projects, which would likely have diluted the band’s output. And, as the studio laboratory demands an enormous amount of time and concentrated energy, it seems unlikely that they would have been able to return to that ultimate level of collaboration as a band. Led Zeppelin entered the scene just as The Beatles were beginning to burn out and fragment. They changed rock music forever by inventing an entirely new genre. Plant, Page, and Bonham have influenced nearly every rock singer, guitarist, and drummer that followed. A band like Zep is much better suited than The Beatles to stadium concerts and festivals, which were becoming more prevalent at the dawn of the 70s. As was the new freeform, DJ programmed FM Radio. Who knows which ensemble might have sustained more success or what the world might look like had they all kept the flame burning? Both bands were magical combinations of extraordinarily gifted, charismatic genius. It may seem obvious to say that the world is much better for the music of both bands. We’ll just have to be satisfied with the treasures they left us."},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","output":"I would like to say A Wednesday and Special 26.

Tell a friend you’d like to cook them dinner. Grab some kind of protein: fish, pork chops, chicken, whatever you feel like cooking, and a bottle of wine. Take those items to their house and make a bad ass meal with whatever they have on hand, no asking beforehand, that’s cheating. If you really wanna blow them away, show up with nothing but the wine. It’s a roll of the dice though, since they may have nothing to use as a center of the plate item on hand. Promising to make dinner and having to order pizza will leave you with egg on your face. I did this one time and found that my friend didn’t have any salt. They had oil, vinegars, spices and some useful veggies but no salt. I had to run out and buy a box of kosher salt to make my meal. They were grateful because that box of salt transformed their cooking.

If that doesn’t scream dysfunctional, I don’t know what does. The Kinks had a heck of a time too. Liked to start fights, banned from the US for most of the 60’s, stopped being a band for a bit and became more of a theater troupe, became a band again, picked a fight with the burgeoning punk scene, became MTV stars, and crashed and burned. Only to reunite many years later with only three surviving members, two of which say they’re cool but can’t help but slyly snipe each other, and none of them can get their stories straight on if it’s even really a reunion or not. Of course, that’s not the most messed up, just one of the most dysfunctional. When it comes to messed up, solo artists usually come to mind instead of bands, so for now I shall decline to answer."},{"instruction":"What program do photographers use to edit photos?","output":"Photoshop is surly the most used one.

The Treasure Fleet was dazzlingly opulent and awesome, with ships that dwarfed those of the Europeans, and the fleet was crewed by thousands. Yet they left no cultural evidence in the legends of the tribes and nations on the coast of the Americas. No one tells the legend of the passing of the Great Fleet. And sailors enjoy their nights out. Zheng He may have been a eunuch, but it’s doubtful that the several thousand men he had crewing his ships were. And yet there’s no genetic evidence in Native American blood. Furthermore, there are no records of such a voyage in Chinese archives. Zheng He’s fleet sailed west, not east.

Here are some tips to help you create high-quality vector artwork: 1. Start with a Clear Idea: Have a clear concept or idea in mind before you begin. Planning your composition and design beforehand will help you stay focused and organized during the creation process. 2. Use the Right Software: Choose a vector graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, which provides powerful tools specifically designed for creating and editing vector artwork. 3. Work with Layers: Organize your artwork using layers. This will allow you to work on different elements separately and make adjustments easily without affecting the rest of the design. 4. Utilize Basic Shapes: Start with basic shapes like circles, squares, and rectangles to build the foundation of your artwork. Then, refine and transform these shapes to create more complex forms. 5. Pay Attention to Proportions: Ensure that your artwork maintains proper proportions. Use grids or guidelines to align elements correctly. 6. Be Mindful of Colors: Choose a cohesive color palette that complements your design. Consistent color usage can enhance the overall aesthetics of your vector drawing. 7. Master Bezier Curves: Practice using Bezier curves to create smooth and precise lines. Understanding how to manipulate anchor points and handles will help you achieve clean and flowing shapes. 8. Incorporate Layers of Detail: Add depth and interest to your artwork by incorporating layers of detail. This can be achieved through gradients, textures, or subtle shading. 9. Experiment with Brushes and Effects: Experiment with various brush styles and effects to add texture and visual interest to your vector artwork. 10. Save Iteratively: Save your work at different stages, using incremental file names. This will enable you to backtrack or revert to earlier versions if needed. 11. Check for Scalability: Ensure that your vector artwork is scalable without losing quality. Vector graphics can be resized without any loss of resolution, making them suitable for various applications. 12. Seek Inspiration: Look at other artists' vector work for inspiration and learn from their techniques. Analyze what makes their designs visually appealing and try to incorporate similar elements into your own creations. Remember that creating impressive vector artwork takes practice and patience. Don't be afraid to experiment and refine your techniques. Over time, you'll develop your style and improve your skills as a vector artist."},{"instruction":"Where do I find a local professional knitter?

Here are a few possible explanations that people may consider: Divine Plan: Some religious traditions teach that God has a plan for every individual and that the answers to prayers may not always align with what we desire in the short term. It's possible that what we're asking for might not be in line with the greater plan that God has for us.Timing: People often pray for things they want or need in their lives, but the timing of when those things occur might not be immediate or even in the timeframe we expect. What we perceive as an unanswered prayer could be a matter of the right time not having arrived yet.Free Will: Many belief systems emphasize the importance of free will, meaning that God allows individuals to make their own choices and decisions. If what you're praying for involves the actions or choices of other people, God might not interfere with their free will to fulfill your request.Spiritual Growth: Some religious teachings suggest that challenges and difficulties can be opportunities for spiritual growth and development. What may seem like an unanswered prayer could be a way for you to learn and grow through adversity.Mystery of God: In many faiths, God's ways are often considered mysterious and beyond human comprehension. It's possible that there are reasons beyond our understanding for why prayers are not always answered in the way we hope.Faith and Trust: Maintaining faith and trust, even in the face of what appears to be unanswered prayers, can be a test of one's faith. It's possible that your faith is being tested or strengthened through the experience of waiting and uncertainty.Prayer Format: Some people believe that the manner in which prayers are made can influence their effectiveness. Focusing on gratitude, asking for guidance, or praying for the well-being of others are different approaches that might yield different results.Lack of Recognition: Sometimes, people attribute positive outcomes to their efforts or external circumstances rather than recognizing them as answers to prayers. It's possible that some prayers are answered in ways that are not immediately recognizable.Reflection and Introspection: The act of prayer can also be a way to reflect on our own desires, needs, and motivations. Sometimes, what we're asking for may not align with our deeper values or long-term well-being. Remember that beliefs about prayer can vary widely based on individual spiritual or religious perspectives. It's a topic that has been contemplated by theologians, philosophers, and believers throughout history, and there might not be a single definitive answer. If you find yourself struggling with this question, it could be helpful to engage in discussions with spiritual leaders, mentors, or others who share your faith.

I’m going into my 4th year at UofT (St George). Here are some *helpful* tips & tricks I’ve discovered over my last 3 years at UofTears. The Registrar’s office is your BFF. Academic Advising appointments are free, and can be made either by taking advantage of “drop in days” at your registrars office, or scheduled in advance. They’re helpful for figuring out the most efficient ways to fulfil program requirements (sometimes you can take 1 credit to fulfil 2 program req’s !!!). Academic Advising is truly a life saver, personally I try to schedule one before every course selection period.Degree Explorer can be accessed through ACORN & is super helpful for understanding how much progress you’re making in your program, it keeps track of all the credits you take and how they’ve been applied to help you achieve your degree. Being able to see how far along you are in your degree is really helpful (for me, personally) because sometimes it’s easy to feel like Uni is this super long, seemingly endless process and Degree Explorer lets you see that you’re truly making real progress!The two sexiest words ever are: “Student Discounts”. If you’re living on/near campus but don’t have a meal plan, or you’re living off campus but near the area, the Metro (grocery store) on Spadina & Bloor (by Spadina subway station) has student discount days on Tuesday & Wednesday. The Metro on 89 Gould st (Ryerson Campus) has the same discount on Thursday & Friday. Saving 10% might not sound like a lot, but even the smallest savings make a big difference in the long run.Hart House Gym is the best for working out if you’re not super athletic/just like going to do lowkey stuff and not feel weird about having all the *Varsity Athletes* “shredding” around you and being super intense. The Hart House pool is also really clean & very pretty for nice relaxing swims!Cool places to study at St. George Campus: 1) Over Easy (208 Bloor St West) they have bottomless coffee & if you’re nice and ask politely they will leave the pot at your table, buy some breakfast foods, & enjoy the quiet, cute aesthetic while you study to the smell of fresh bacon and eggs. 2) Robarts Library is a little overrated if you ask me (cough, cough, sorry UC kids, cough cough) BUT they offer really nice study rooms on the top floors that you can book ahead of time. If you book the ones that face St. George Street you get a lovely view of the CN Tower and the lake. It’s quiet, it’s pretty, it has so many outlets (!!!!!). 3) Bora Laskin Law Library on 78 Queens Park Cres. is suuuuuper pretty! the big room on the main floor has windows that overlook the Philosophy Park, so it’s peaceful. The tables are also huge so if you need to sprawl out and take up space this is the place for you!The 24 Hour McDonalds On Yonge st. Across From Charles st. Is Scary After 8pm Every Night Of The Week. Go To The One On Bloor St. Across From The ROM Instead.Academically Speaking: UofT is hard, I won’t lie. I’ve discovered that getting to know your profs through going to office hours is a really good way to boost your grades. More often than not, going to office hours with your questions, interests, thoughts & rough drafts is an amazing opportunity to learn the most! AND, believe it or not, Profs Love Talking (usually). If you start going to one office hour appointment every other week, or even once or twice a month your grades are more likely to be higher because you’re both engaging more with the material, and allowing the prof to help guide you through assignments! Not a lot of students take advantage of this opportunity and honestly, I think this has been the best thing Ive done for my GPA & my own learning. It’s like a free tutor session with a True Expert! Also, building friendships with profs that are teaching something you might want to go to Grad School for is a really good way to ensure you’ll have GREAT recommendation/reference letters for future applications!EXAM REPOSITORY!!! Sometimes old exams can be found online & it’s a really good way to know the layout and possible questions ahead of time. It’s like a cheat sheet except it’s totally legit & won’t get you into trouble.Don’t be afraid to ask for extensions! Make sure you ask politely, and well ahead of time. More often than not if you’re honest, polite, and show that you’re planning ahead the professor is more than happy to give you a little extra time on papers/big assignments. Don’t take advantage of it too much though, only use it when you truly need it. Side Note: If you have Academic Accomodations you can ask for extensions through these accomodations & it’s a lot more official. If you have any kind of learnin needs scheduling an appointment with Academic Accomodation to register these needs is a good way to ensure you’re getting the support you need to do your best. Congratulations on getting into UofT! This is very St. George campus based, but I hope it’s helpful! Goodluck!! :)"},{"instruction":"f you could design your own house, what would it be like?","output":"House name: Czhatere (A corruption of the Sanskrit word, Kshatriya, meaning warrior).

You should be able to guess the manner in which the actor wanted to deliver a dialogue. The dubbed Movie doesn't care about the tone they just want a fun movie even if it has a serious touch. I saw The Man of Steel by mistake in Hindia and man was it one of my biggest mistake of my life. I watch Japanese Animes and in those i have experienced that the subbed is always better than dubbed.

Can’t it just tell itself to be happy or pleasured? I just don’t get why it needs to do that if we’re basically our brains.","output":"No. Your brain and the synapses and chemical processes it goes through are a response to stimuli, external and internal. There are also several glands in your body that play a role in the development, production, and regulation of hormones within your body, such as the pituitary gland. Dopamine, norepinephrine, oxytocin, these are things normally regulated by the pituitary gland and released into the brain in response to certain situations. And these can be taken advantage of by substances like coffee, narcotics, and simulants. If you use drugs like heroin, cocaine, etc. these drugs tend to cause the overproduction and excessive release of hormones like dopamine into the brain which causes feelings of euphoria and intense pleasure. But if done too often, this can result in exhausting and damaging the synapses and neural networks that release these hormones into the brain, causing them to shut down. Permanently. Which means you progressively lose the ability to feel pleasure. From anything. You also tend to require higher volumes and concentrations of these drugs as a result of building up a tolerance to them, which causes further damage. This is part of why it's so difficult for recovering drug addicts not to relapse, because they feel they can't get the same high from other activities and experiences in their lives. It's like being in a constant depressive state and feeling numb to everything. Devoid of pleasure and happiness. This is why it would be incredibly detrimental to your health for your brain to constantly release dopamine in an attempt to try and keep itself perpetually happy. You would only end up ruining your ability to experience any happiness or pleasure in response to anything."},{"instruction":"w can I lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without exercising?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: \\"How To Lose Weight Fast\\"In our fast-paced world, many individuals desire to shed excess weight quickly.

Announcement of future MCU movies in San Diego Comic Con has shown what grand plan they have with these Phases. Phase 4 is like an introductory phase, much like Phase 1 & 2, where many important characters were shown for the first time. Let me briefly point out the new characters introduced in Phase 4. Wanda Vision - This web series was the first one in Phase 4. It showed the aftermath of Endgame, but more importantly it showed the transition between Wanda and Scarlett Witch. It introduced us to Scarlet Witch, who would be the main villain in Multiverse of Madness.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier - This web series focused on the journey of Sam Wilson into the new Captain America. With the announcement of a new Captain America movie, this web series now seems much more relevant.Loki - We have all been confused about how the multiverse will actually work, and this webseries told us about that. It also introduced us to the new villain, Kang the Conqueror, who would be the main villain in the next Avengers movie.Black Widow - It’s the most unimportant movie of Phase 4 whose only aim was to please some fans and introduce Yelena as the new Black Widow.What If - Again, this series explored the endless possibilities of events in the multiverse. It gives answers to the fans about how certain events would look under different circumstances.Shang Chi - Again, this movie introduced us to a new character, Shang Chi, who would play a pivotal role in future Avengers movies.Hawk Eye - This webseries gave us much needed deep insight into the life of Hawk-Eye, one of the few Avengers without any superpower. It also introduced us to Kate Bishop, who could potentially be the part of Young Avengers and would take on the mantle of Hawk-Eye from Clint.Eternals - This movie served as an introductory movie for the Eternals and the Celestials, who I believe will play a much larger role in future MCU movies.Spider-Man No Way Home - It answered the most important question, what is the multiverse and how tampering with it will affect the present universe. While there were no new characters involved, it showed the implication of messing with the multiverse. Also, it was a great fan service.Doctor Strange and Multiverse of Madness - Scarlett Witch, who was introduced in Wanda Vision, served as the main villain in this movie. It took from where NWH was left and showed the implications of tampering with the flow of time. It gave us glimpse about how much important this multi-verse travelling will be in future movies. It also introduced a new superhero, America Chavez.Moon Knight - While I don't find any way how this webseries is relevant to the current vision of MCU, but I do think that next season will answer that question as we’re introduced to a completely new and different kind of superhero.Thor, God of Love and Thunder - In my view, this is the weakest Phase 4 movie. At least, Black Widow introduced a new member, which can not be said for this movie, though. The only new members introduced are those who could potentially be the members of Young Avengers.She-Hulk - Again, a new character is introduced who will play a pivotal role in future Ms. Marvel movie. So, considering all these facts, I think Phase 4 is not aimless. On the contrary, this Phase introduces us to all new characters who would play a pivotal role in Phase 5 & 6, and would ultimately set up the Avenger 4 and 5. Before San Diego Comic Con, I too doubted the relevance of this Phase, but with the announcement of new Avengers movies, all things seems to fit in place. I will not term this Phase as good, as there are many bad movies, but this Phase will serve as a bridge to cross from Phase 3 to Phase 5."},{"instruction":"Should gun owners and their children be put into reeducation camps?","output":"Should NON-gun owners, who by definition have failed their civic duty to be armed and trained, and their children be put into reeducation camps?

But I know how it was for me. I was raised in one of the worst types of religion, complete with all the bigotry and judgemental finger pointing. Although I walked away from everything in my teens, some vague belief in the existence of a god remained, even though I never acted on it. One day, perhaps in my mid-thirties, the penny dropped. I decided to assume, for one week only, that no god existed. So much fell into place in that week and world began to make more sense. I could even start to appreciate the miracle(!) of nature more readily. Anyway, I stuck with the idea of ‘no god’. The basic science I’ve learned since then seems to back this up so I’ve stayed with that. Some have accused me of being closed minded due to my non-belief. They are wrong. I had to open up my mind way beyond my previous boundaries in order understand that the likelihood of a god existing is infinitesimally small."},{"instruction":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","output":"I struggle with infinity when I was about 8 years old. I always slept outside on a cot, in a sleeping bag, on our patio. One night I was trying to wrap my brain around infinity. I pictured myself flying through the Universe as fast as I could go. I kept going and going and going, maybe for 20 minutes in my head. Then I thought, I still haven’t put a dent in infinity. No matter how long I traveled, it never got me closer to infinity. I think I finally came to grips about infinity. Or, think of the largest number you can think of, then add 1 to it. Or, You can write as many zeros after a number as you like and it still doesn’t get you any closer. 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 + 1. Still, you are infinity away from infinity. This is why exponential notation is important. 1 x 10^9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 is a hell of a big number. A 1 followed by 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 zeros. That’s a lot of zeros. So we move to factorial expression. 1! = 1 x 1 = 1 2! = 1 x 2 = 2 3! = 1 x 2 x 3 = 6 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 5! = 24 x 5 = 120 6! = 120 x 6 = 720 7! = 720 x 7 = 5,040 8! = 5,040 x 8 = 40,320 9! = 40,320 x 9 = 362,888 10! = 362,888 x 10 = 3,628,800 11! = 3,628,880 x 11 = 39,916,800 So, you can see how quickly the factorial can rise. So now think of the largest number you can think of and take its factorial. (1 x 10^gazillion)! Can you imagine how large that number would be? And yet, you still are no closer to infinity. Infinity is without end."},{"instruction":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God?

Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable?","output":"Do sunset towns still exist in America where only whites are allowed after dark? Have you been to one, and was the racism noticable? Legally or officially? No—by custom or fear? Yes. I grew up in Massachusetts, a fairly liberal, “blue” state, but its racial history has hardly been rosy. While things like Jim Crow and racial violence was relatively rare segregation via social pressures existed. Boston was still integrating schools well into the 1970s, and in the 1980s when a white man murdered his pregnant wife and claimed it was a “black carjacker” it pushed the city to a near race-riot after. I grew up in an upper-middle class mostly white suburb where the population lived in fear of the “city” near by. I distinctly recall white adults confiding to each other that if they saw a “black guy” walking down their street they would “call the police” because “he doesn't belong there.” What strikes me is this was said simply, matter-of-factually, not as a boast, or hysteria or even whispered admission, it was just…stated as if it was the most natural cause-and-effect. As if that’s what one is supposed to do. And that seems to be rather common for white people to catch the glimpse of a black person and then dial 911. There are towns where “driving while black” will get you pulled over. There have been black teenagers walking home to be stopped by “concerned citizens,” and had violence done to them. In New York City there is the infamous “stop and frisk.” Other places African-Americans will avoid out of memory. The area around where the infamous Rosewood Florida massacre happened was avoid by African-Americans—especially after dark for decades—a community that had once been over 40% black was basically 100% white for eighty years after.

Everyone loves the right not to be shot by some nut. The death penalty always ends up killing innocents. Its in the psychology of the police and the legal system to facilitate this to a weird extend. Gay marriage is settled. Marriage has been redefined from being a contract of conveyance of property (girl) from father to husband for the purpose of raising a family, to the union of two people in love. No one likes abortion. I personally believe life begins at conception.

It is a bond that is built on trust, mutual respect, and a willingness to be there for one another through thick and thin. Real friendship involves a deep level of caring and concern for one another's well-being. It means being there to offer support, comfort, and encouragement when needed, and celebrating each other's successes and accomplishments. Friendship also involves honesty, openness, and the ability to communicate freely and openly with one another. It means being able to share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment or rejection. At its core, friendship is about accepting and embracing one another for who you are, flaws and all. It's about building a strong and lasting connection with another person that enriches your life and brings you joy and fulfillment."},{"instruction":"Would you ever wear a Rolex submariner with a suit and/or blazer?","output":"Absolutely! As already mentioned, Rolex advertised their Submariner model with a suit, and furthermore, Sean Connery was also seen wearing the Submariner with a suit in the James Bond movie. The Submariner has grown so immensely popular partly because it has proven to be so immensely universal. It is made to be a rugged diver’s watch, able to withstand extreme pressure, but at the same time, today, the majority of people who wear a Submariner never even shower with their watch, not to mention dive with it. The Submariner really has a timeless design, and it has an impressive versality since it looks just as good with a diver’s suit as with jeans, or with a suit. In the Rolex advertisement for the Submariner, Rolex wrote “You’ll find it in the cockpits of most ocean racers as hard-driving skippers beat down to Bermuda, Hobart, and the Fastnet Rock. How come it’s seen so much where the wettest thing is a Dry Martin? Who knows. Maybe it’s because the black dial goes so well with a black tie. Ask her, maybe she knows. So, not only is the Submariner a great watch to wear with a suit, but it is also because the steel against the black goes very well with a suit.

People with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or other medical conditions that make breathing difficult should check with their health care provider before using an N95 respirator because the N95 respirator can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe.

Note that N95 respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when sterile conditions are needed. All FDA-cleared N95 respirators are labeled as \\"single-use,\\" disposable devices. If your respirator is damaged or soiled, or if breathing becomes difficult, you should remove the respirator, discard it properly, and replace it with a new one. To safely discard your N95 respirator, place it in a plastic bag, and put it in the trash. Wash your hands after handling the used respirator.

GarageBand is perfectly capable of professional recordings. The music equipment industry is based on selling you equipment with the promise that you can sound like your favorite artists that you listen to on the radio but the simple fact is the skill and talent of the people involved in making those records is why those recordings sound great. Learn about room acoustics. You can’t adequately judge what your hearing until the space you are listening in sounds halfway decent. Learn about mic placement, it really matters. Moving the mic a few inches this way or that can change everything. Learn about gain staging. This means having the amount of signal at the optimal level at each stage of the recording process. For example, if the input gain of a mic is too much it will sound distorted. If it is too low it will sound noisy and weak. Learn about the art of arrangement and mixing. This can transform the ordinary into something incredible. My point is, start learning about the whole endeavor of making great recordings. You’ll find that while there are better, more capable recording prgrams, GarageBand is not your problem.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"There are several states that have passed bills that essentially say that the state won’t be enforcing any new federal firearm laws. My home state of New Hampshire is one of them. What does this mean? Same thing it meant when certain states stopped enforcing federal drugs laws when it came to marijuana and the same thing it meant when sanctuary cities declared they wouldn’t enforce federal immigration laws: if the feds want to kick over that bucket of worms then they’re going to have to clean up the mess themselves. Usually, local law enforcement “cooperate” with the federal government when the feds investigate crimes or execute their lawful authority in a state. I use the quotes because cooperate implies a two-way street of mutual trust and information sharing but I have friends in law enforcement that have told me in no uncertain terms that particular street is actually a horse-path narrow enough for only 1 ass. So, a buddy of mine and I were talking about this some time ago. What would this look like exactly and I came up with a scenario that I think paints a somewhat accurate enough picture. Let’s say the federal government suddenly decides that SBR (short-barreled rifles) are outlawed. Let’s assume this passed by legislation and the gun lobby fails to secure an injunction while filing a lawsuit. Let’s say you happen to have one (these are NFA items, so they have to be registered with the feds and tax stamped the same as full-auto weapons [for the under-informed]). Let’s also assume the government says “turn your SBR’s in by such and such a date” and you fail to comply because you live in one of these states vowed not to enforce new federal gun controls. What happens? The local sheriff, who is bound by state law not to enforce the fed law isn’t coming to your house to serve a federal warrant or collect your firearm. I doubt they would even send a letter. So if the feds really want your SBR, they’re going to have to come and take it. So let’s assume they do. Let’s assume they send an agent to your door to arrest you and seize your SBR. I speculate the following: If you know what is about to go down, best thing you can do is call the local police. Do everything in your power to keep from being arrested by the feds, stay out of their vehicles, and resist until authorities show up. When the locals arrive they can now fight it out with the feds. The feds are serving a warrant that your state does not recognize as legal. Either the local cops are going to be able to scoot the feds along, or they are going to capitulate with the feds and you’re going to prison until this all gets sorted out. My guess as to what will actually happen? Nothing. The feds aren’t going to go door to door collecting firearms; they aren’t going to go door to door to enforce new laws. Locals have home-court advantage with this respect. At most, if you happen to get stopped by a fed (yeah right, last time I was stopped by the FBI was, oh, never) and you have your SBR on you then they will add illegal possession to the list of other charges and confiscate the weapon. Federal law only has teeth because locals enforce it. There aren’t enough federal agents to enforce federal laws throughout these United States."},{"instruction":"What is the most ridiculous “allergy” or “dietary requirements” a customer has claimed to have while ordering food?","output":"After a decade in culinary I got a few… A woman who was lactose-intolerant but demanded to have the cheesecake.A man claiming to be allergic to Elk meat at a plated set-menu dinner so he could be the only one eating a regular steak.A woman who was allergic to nuts, seafood, nitrates, dairy, gluten, eggs, soy, pollen, and was a vegan used to come in every week and have us custom make a dish every time.A woman who claimed to have Celiacs disease, but was caught filling up her purse with bread rolls(she knew they weren’t gluten-free) before she left."},{"instruction":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","output":"I do not, or at least very rarely do. At first I thought this was simply due to not being well-known, but more and more I see that women take a lot of shit on this site, whether they have a hundred followers or 10K. I am not sure why I seem to be more or less immune from it. It might be that I just don't notice. Or it might be that I don't react enough to make it worth it. If it were in person, I could understand it - several people close to me have said I carry the scent of danger, and it takes a particularly stupid or insane person to fuck with a girl who will bite and claw like she's got nothing to lose - but online, that is less evident, and there are other women who have far sharper tongues and wits than mine. My immunity baffles me, to be frank. I hear about all the bullshit that women put up with - and see plenty of screenshots of it - and I feel both thankful and a little guilty that I am rarely touched by any of it. Edit: A third option occurs to me, which is the possibility that my Quoran ex made it known at some point that I was his. If this is the case, I never heard anything about it - as far as I know, he never told anyone about us, and I certainly never did - nor can I see him caring enough to want to protect me, particularly after we were no longer together.

Over the course of 36 years. The funny things about photos or a cultivated image is that they only show a split second of an instant. They don’t show what’s really happening. And if you look at the narrative of the reality in the photo or of the image you present to the world enough, you may prefer that. You may prefer the illusion, the game face and the image to the messy person and process behind the photos. To find authenticity you may have to shatter your photographs or your image of yourself or one you’re holding up for others and make a mess. To rip through beautiful images completely to shreds and then reconstruct them with scotch tape and see what’s left. And then take new photos. Or none. But see clearly. I did that this year and this is what I understand. I didn’t use real tape. But I do see now that parts of what I photographed over years was me, and that part of me chose the illusion, the image that people found pleasing , over and over again and did not want to look critically any harder or to ask questions about who I was. I was afraid to lose things, to lose face, and to lose myself. I lost all of that but it was worth it. These were some of my photos over the last 2–6 years: I looked happy and I was. But there were things wrong below the surface. When those things surfaced or betrayed me, I looked away. When I couldn’t look away, the floor fell away and I was devastated. I lived this way right until I became physically devastatingly sick. I misdirected all the problems. I clung to joy. I didn’t make room for sadness or betrayal or anger or grief or fear or disappointment or dissatisfaction or feeling insufficient . I was constantly hiding while I was showing small parts of myself that looked right to me. It was cumbersome and I was handicapped by the effort long before I was ever physically disabled. I didn’t allow myself to own who I was or my feelings. Not the complicated ones. The ugly ones. The ones that made me look bad. Or feel bad about how I seemed. Right before I became devastatingly Ill, my weight spiked. It only began to drop as I started to become symptomatic. It didn’t matter how little I ate or exercised. The numbers went up to numbers that were stratospheric for me. I hated myself. My pain free functioning body. I don’t understand the way I thought then now. Then I spent almost a year in pain, incapacitated. Everything I did was its own unique torture. I was a circumstantial prisoner in my home. I missed the sunlight but it hurt my eyes. I was often isolated with my own thoughts. My trips out were to therapy and doctors appointments. I started to write. I got to know myself. I ripped it all to pieces. I let go of hundreds of relationships that were meaningless, or meaningful and bad. I had never noticed that they were empty. What it looked like didn’t matter any more. What it looked like stopped mattering as much as what it was. What it was stopped mattering as much as what it ought to be I kept the things that had been real. The things that were never only an image. I’ve learned to like myself. As I am. That is no small thing in a year like mine. I am braver. I know who I am. I’m not afraid to say. I stand up for what I believe. I’m not afraid to take a risk to have integrity. I do take photos. I’m trained as a visual artist. I did digital self portraits for years. I take lots of photos. But they’re only photos. They don’t mean anything. The effort happens in my real life. I know a great photo doesn’t mean I have a great life. I make that happen by working really, really hard despite obstacles and hardship.

Elvis with his good friend BB King in 1955. Elvis’ first single was a cover of blues singer Arthur Crudup’s song, “That’s Alright”. However, Elvis Presley turned it into a rockabilly song. His phrasing is strictly hillbilly. The B-side is where things get interesting. Here Elvis takes a bluegrass standard, “Blue Moon of Kentucky”, changes it to 4/4 time and interprets it like a gospel song. So, on Elvis’ very first single he turns a blues classic into a hillbilly/rockabilly rave up and a bluegrass standard into a Black gospel song. Not since Hank Williams had a southern born white singer emphasized the commonality between country and the blues. Elvis Presley absorbed the prevalent musical styles of early 1950’s Memphis and the wider region. Although he grew up in a segregated section of the USA Elvis Presley had been exposed to African American gospel music at a very early age. Before he ever became famous he was a familiar figure on Beale Street. At the same time he was proficient in country, bluegrass, Texas swing and rockabilly.

A 12-man jury is sent to begin deliberations in the first-degree murder trial of an 18-year-old man accused in the stabbing death of his father, where a guilty verdict means an automatic death sentence. The case appears to be open-and-shut: The defendant has a weak alibi; a knife he claimed to have lost is found at the murder scene; and several witnesses either heard screaming, saw the killing or the boy fleeing the scene. Eleven of the jurors immediately vote guilty; only Juror No. 8 (Mr. Davis) casts a not guilty vote. At first Mr. Davis bases his vote more so for the sake of discussion; after all, the jurors must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. As the deliberations unfold, the story quickly becomes a study of the jurors' complex personalities (which range from wise, bright and empathetic to arrogant, prejudiced and merciless), preconceptions, backgrounds and interactions. That provides the backdrop to Mr. Davis' attempts in convincing the other jurors that a \\"not guilty\\" verdict might be appropriate.

DNL is Differential Non-linearity. Here’s a Wikipedia article about this: [LINKED_TEXT: Differential nonlinearity - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Demonstrates A. Differential Linearity where a change in the input produces a corresponding change in output and B. Differential Non-linearity, where the relationship is not directly linear Differential nonlinearity (acronym DNL ) is a commonly used measure of performance in digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters. It is a term describing the deviation between two analog values corresponding to adjacent input digital values. It is an important specification for measuring error in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC); the accuracy of a DAC is mainly determined by this specification. Ideally, any two adjacent digital codes correspond to output analog voltages that are exactly one Least Significant Bit (LSB) apart. Differential non-linearity is a measure of the worst-case deviation from the ideal 1 LSB step. For example, a DAC with a 1.5 LSB output change for a 1 LSB digital code change exhibits 1⁄2 LSB differential non-linearity. Differential non-linearity may be expressed in fractional bits or as a percentage of full scale. A differential non-linearity greater than 1 LSB may lead to a non- monotonic transfer function in a DAC. [1] It is also known as a missing code . Differential linearity refers to a constant relation between the change in the output and input. For transducers if a change in the input produces a uniform step change in the output the transducer possess differential linearity. Differential linearity is desirable and is inherent to a system such as a single-slope analog-to-digital converter used in nuclear instrumentation . Formula [ edit ] DNL(i) = V out ( i + 1 ) − V out ( i ) ideal LSB step width − 1 {displaystyle {text{DNL(i)}}={{V_{text{out}}(i+1)-V_{text{out}}(i)} over {text{ideal LSB step width}}}-1} Effects of DNL [ edit ] If the DNL of an ADC is smaller than -1, missing codes appear in the transfer function, i.e. there are codes for which there is no input voltage to get the code at the ADC output. If the DNL of a DAC is bigger than 1, the transfer function of the DAC becomes non-monotonic . A non-monotonic DAC is especially not desired in closed-loop control application as it may cause stability problems, i.e. it may cause oscillations. See also [ edit ] References [ edit ] External links [ edit ]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_nonlinearity] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_nonlinearity]Missing codes are related to DNL, as mentioned in the above article. In my experience, there is a difference however-missing codes for an ADC are tested with a high-slew-rate AC signal, rather than just at DC.

Both have similar speeds yet the M2 type is way more expensive.","output":"I think that you are getting things a bit confused here. SATA and M.2 are types of physical connections to a motherboard for storage devices. SATA connected drives use the SATA protocol to communicate with a controller. Storage connected via the M.2 connector can either use the SATA protocol to communicate with a SATA controller or use NVMe to interface with the computer via PCIe. Drives connecting to the computer via a SATA controller have a maximum bandwidth of 6 gigabits per second when connected via the SATA III protocol. This bandwidth limitation applies to all storage whether it is using a m.2 slot or a SATA cable. In practice, a SATA III drive is limited to around 545 megabytes per second of actual bandwidth. SSDs using the SATA III protocol are generally around the same price no matter which format the drive is using (SATA or M.2). Drives connecting to the computer via a NVMe interface are limited to the bandwidth provided by the PCIe lanes in use. SSD drives like the Samsung 9x0 series and Intel’s 660p series use up to 4 lanes of PCIe gen 3 to achieve up to 3.94 gigabytes per second of bandwidth. In practice the NVMe drives generally max out at around 3.7 gigabytes per second if the SSD controller can handle it. NVMe drives are usually around twice the price per gigabyte compared to SATA SSDs. In other words, SATA III SSDs are roughly the same price whether they use a SATA connection or a M.2 connection and are capable of the same performance using either connection. NVMe drives use PCIe lanes to provide a lot more bandwidth and performance compared to SATA III SSDs but are more expensive per gigabyte."},{"instruction":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","output":"Mac Arthur Park by Donna Summer"},{"instruction":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends.

You will pay, and from what I’m told, these loans can take forever to process, leading to delays and people struggling to actually come to terms with a buyer (but that’s secondhand).You can get a secured credit card. Basically, you give them 500 and they give you a credit card with a 500 limit. It’s not a debit card. It will help you build credit, if used properly. Strictly speaking, they’re kind of loaning you your own money.Are you an American citizen or perman.ent resident? You can get a student loan for trade school or college. There are strict caps, but you can get the loan. No credit check.I doubt banks given unsecured personal loans to people with low credit. Also, if you are undocumented, it’s going to be very difficult.

Sublime Text[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://www.sublimetext.com/]- I started using Sublime in 2010(exactly 2 years after its launch). Its performance is great. It has a beautiful UI. The minimap feature is amazing. In my opinion, its speed is too good as it is built on C++. It is best suited for large files and packages. If you are working on a big project, then it is a good choice. The size of the editor is only 5 MB and is extremely light. The free version is good but if you want to purchase the pro version then it costs 70 for the license and i feel it is little more because there are lots of free editors available today. Atom[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://atom.io/]- In 2014, I heard about a great editor called Atom. It is maintained by Github. It has most of the features of Sublime Text and it is free and open source. Due to these reasons, I switched to Atom. It has a smart spell check, autocomplete feature, etc. One thing I noticed is that it is slow and sluggish at the start as it is close to 300MB. It has some performance issues. Visual Code - In 2015, Microsoft launched Visual studio code. I found this tool the best among these. It is faster than Atom but little slower than Sublime. It is fun working with Visual studio code.

What AOC is referring too is: male sexual harrassment and intimidation. I am a male, I am 196cm, bald headed, broad shouldered and if I don’t smile or look serious (which means I am thinking or concentrating) most people are very uncomfortable approaching me. Professionally speaking I am a senior manager and normally manage somewhere between 50 and 150 people. Out which 75% is female. Over the years I have reported to senior leadership. Big titles, big cars, big ego those type of folks. 50% male and 50% female. I have experienced extremely bullying by three executives. 1 male, who suffered from Gordon Gekko syndrome, but at leas he was consistent, non gender biased in his bullying. 1 female executive had to start every meeting with “us girls have to stick together” and decided I was her alpha male to tame. After one year I changed divisions and found leadership that was professional and competent. female executive 2 suffered from Roseanne Barr syndrome. Horrible people skills, an ego that wouldn’t fit into a Zeppelin and loved to pick on the male subordinated with very inappropriate behaviour and I am not even mentioning her behaviour at the much dreaded office parties. I was very happy to leave that company as her behaviour was tolerated by the company. My point is that positions of power tend to create a few monster regardless of gender. But as a guy my story doesn’t fit the current climate and believe me there are many people out there who are victims or power hungry executive leaders regardless of gender, religion or sexual orientation"},{"instruction":"My family wants to put my cat down.

The school principal knows all about this and does nothing. I am sorry I am in the class of someone who teaches children to be victims of abuse. I am sorry that I go to a school that actively promotes bullying by punishing victims when they try to defend themselves. I am glad that I haven’t been the victim of anything more serious than bullying by some gutless little coward. If I had been, I would be sorry that I go to a school where the teachers would not be there to help me in a time of real need.

I am sorry that I spend seven hours a day, 200 days a year - more waking hours than I spend in the company of my parents - with adults who care so little about their students’ welfare. I am sorry that they don’t understand that by encouraging Joe and his bullying, they are doing him no favours for the life that lies ahead of him. My mother and father have raised me, above all else, to be true to myself and honest with others. I am not sorry for what I did to Joe.

Edit: Somebody asked a great question in the comments. “As a prosecutor, is this how you talk to the judge in court?” The answer is no, I don’t. It is a fundamental principle of our justice system that the accused gets to speak. Any time somebody is being sentenced, there are reasons why the person did what he did, and we want to know them. There are mitigating factors in the accused’s life that explain how he got to this point, and we want to hear them. These things significantly affect the punishment they receive.

Definitely not a Danish person. Nowhere in the original book does it mention that the Little Mermaid is of Danish descent, Danish origin, that any of her kind even ever set foot on danish soil before she did. She lives in the water. Not on any land. Never set foot on the land of any nation or human culture until partway through the book, so to say she is part of that culture of human s is a bad joke at best. The Prince I believe is meant to be Danish, though in 1989 they removed any defined nation that he might be from out of the cartoon, but did give him and his assistant Danish names. But of course because this isn’t about culture, it’s about melanin, the same thing racism usually is. In 1989 Disney: Gave the little mermaid a name, a Hebrew name of Ariel. Gave the girls father a Greek name. Gave the Sea Witch a Latin name not popular in northern Europe outside of England. Made her formerly blonde hair (at times pictured dark brown early on) red (the 1989 version was written by a person with Irish heritage). Made another human looking character with blue skin (a skin color not associated with Danish 19th century people). Changed the entire story from Danish to English Changed the location to the Caribbean. (remind me when this crosses the “appropriation of the Danish culture” line by the writer/directors who weren’t dark skinned). Removed 5 sisters. Took away her Grandmother. Made her silver scales blue/green. Took away her subservience to her father and the prince as would be more common and expected in 19th century Denmark and made her much more rebellious. Completely rewrote her transformation. Completely removed the heart and theme of the written story about mermaids not having Souls. Gave her singing and talking sea creature friends. All this done by an Irish Catholic born and raised in Chicago (but don’t worry, his tan was not very pronounced). But guess where the “is this appropriation” comes from? Not a word there, but the skin color being a few shades darker than some people believe it should be due to increased melanin production in the actress's body portraying the fictional sea creature which has ZERO danish descent noted in the book or the original cartoon. So the pro-white supremacist/nationalist groups of 4chan and 8chan and other bilges of the internet got going and of course it spread among their allies and here we are. Nothing about all those changes made but one triggers them. I wonder why the “IOTBW” groups that people like former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke have supported are actively upset here. If only we could figure this out (sarcasm). And thus we have all the false narratives, red herrings and other logical fallacies trying to say ANYTHING but where this started and grew from. You can’t make up just how dumb racism is when you actually look at it. Imagine if they made a Ghost which is described as white and with human characteristics in a light brown color instead of white like Casper. Or Pinnochio described as being of red pine instead of white pine. The melanin required to be a sea creature. This is the kind of things white supremacists get upset about in their echo chambers and blame people about ghosts, sea creatures and wooden puppet colors."},{"instruction":"it okay as a beginner guitar player to skip chord F?","output":"The F major chord is like a ‘right of passage’ for most beginner guitar players, so don’t feel too badly, it is a difficult chord to play at first, but you know if you keep practicing, and just persist it will come to you at last (I hear a song there).

The Armenians have a tradition of building stone “Khachkars” with intricate designs of crosses & Christian symbolism, many that continue to stand today are more then 1,000 years old. The Armenian Apostolic Church is considered to be a part of what it means to be an Armenian. Much so that the rituals of baptism and the holy eucharist are seen as integral parts of Armenian culture. Most importantly, the church has long served as a stronghold and refuge for the Armenian people who’ve found themselves in the middle of competing empires over the last 2–3 centuries. After the Armenian genocide, the Catholicos (Patriarch) of the Armenian Apostolic Church canonized all 1.5 million victims as saints of the church. Today, the Armenian Church is estimated to have the largest number of saints on the planet, even more than the Catholic Church. While the Armenian state today is officially secular, the church is considered the most trustworthy organization in Armenia.

One such example is when Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, invested 5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis. At the time, many investors were fleeing the financial sector, and Goldman Sachs was facing significant challenges. Buffett recognized that Goldman Sachs was a well-run company that would likely survive the crisis and emerge stronger. He negotiated favorable terms for the investment, including a 10% dividend and the option to buy 5 billion worth of Goldman Sachs stock at a discounted price. The investment not only provided Goldman Sachs with much-needed capital, but it also generated significant returns for Berkshire Hathaway. The investment turned out to be a shrewd move, as Goldman Sachs' stock price rebounded, and Berkshire Hathaway ultimately realized a profit of more than 3 billion. Another example of a shrewd business maneuver is the way that Apple has successfully transitioned from a computer company to a consumer electronics company. In the early 2000s, Apple was struggling and was losing market share in the computer industry. However, under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple recognized the potential of the emerging market for consumer electronics and began developing innovative products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Apple's focus on design, usability, and innovation helped it to create a loyal customer base and establish itself as a leader in the consumer electronics market. Overall, these examples demonstrate the importance of shrewd and smart business maneuvers in achieving success in the business world. Successful business leaders are often able to identify opportunities where others see only challenges and are willing to take calculated risks to achieve their goals."},{"instruction":"What percentage of commercial airline pilots could have had the same successful landing as the crew of the Boeing 777 United Airlines flight 328?","output":"Any pilot who holds a U.S. or Canadian or EASA ATP or ATPL would have had no problem."},{"instruction":"w do you open a zip file on a Mac?","output":"To quickly unzip/open a zip file on a MacWindowsLinux，here are a few options for online extraction tools： 1、WinZip Online: WinZip offers an online version of their popular file compression and extraction software.

It contains countless galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial objects.Empty Space: Despite its vastness, outer space is mostly empty. In the vast expanse between celestial objects, there are extremely low densities of particles, resulting in a near-vacuum environment.Extreme Temperatures: Space experiences extreme temperatures. In some areas, such as deep space, temperatures can drop to near absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius), while in close proximity to stars or other energetic sources, temperatures can reach millions of degrees Celsius.Cosmic Microwave Background: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a faint radiation present throughout the universe. It is the remnants of the hot, dense early universe, and its discovery provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.Black Holes: Black holes are regions in space with extremely strong gravitational forces that prevent anything, including light, from escaping their grasp. They form from the remnants of massive stars that collapse under their own gravity.Time Dilation: The concept of time dilation states that time runs slower in regions with intense gravitational fields or high velocities. This phenomenon has been observed and confirmed through experiments and observations of fast-moving objects and objects near massive bodies.Cosmic Expansion: The universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other. This expansion was discovered through observations of distant galaxies and is believed to have started with the Big Bang.The Speed of Light: Light travels at a staggering speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second). This means that light from distant stars and galaxies takes a significant amount of time to reach us, allowing us to observe the universe as it was in the past.Exoplanets: Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Since the first confirmed discovery in 1992, thousands of exoplanets have been identified. They vary in size, composition, and distance from their host stars, raising intriguing possibilities for the existence of habitable worlds.Space Debris: Earth's orbit is cluttered with debris from old satellites, spent rocket stages, and other fragments. This space debris poses a significant challenge for space missions and can potentially collide with operational satellites.Astronomical Units: Astronomical units (AU) are commonly used to measure distances within our solar system.

We have been following the Republican way since Reagan, regardless of which party is in power and that is the problem. The Republican way is the path to a third world economy. By not insisting on manufacturing equipment the military doesn’t even want, for example. The military is our biggest spending by far. Cutting head start & PBS isn’t going to make a fraction of a dent in our debt. By cutting out tax breaks & subsidies for the wealthiest & corporations. By enforcing environmental regulations and policies. We’d save a fortune by preventing disasters rather than cleaning them up afterward. And regulations are not the culprits in lost jobs. They’ve affected a tiny percentage of jobs. Coal jobs have been disappearing for many decades. Do a little search and you’ll find President Kennedy’s efforts to grow other industry in West Virginia to make up for coal job losses. Also, Green jobs grow the economy. Look at Germany. We’d also save a fortune if we’d stop subsidizing food that makes us all sick (and damages the environment). We should instead subsidize small local organic farmers. The people who grow vegetables, for example. By helping people before catastrophe. As it’s been proven by all other developed nations, it’s cheaper to provide universal coverage. It’s also cheaper to house the homeless & help make sure their mental health issues are managed than it is to have EMTs pick them up off the streets and rush them to emergency rooms when they collapse. By funding better education for all. In all neighborhoods. This is an investment that grows the economy. And a preventative. By stopping the pathway straight to prison that exists for so much or our population.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Magazine: A typically box shaped metal or plastic container that holds ammunition to be used by a firearm. It completely encloses the ammunition. It is generally inserted into the firearm at some point, which draws ammunition from it. Clip: Some form of metal clip which hold ammunition to be used by a firearm. It does not completely enclose the ammunition. Although it can be fully inserted into the gun, as in an M1 Garand, it is usually used to make loading the gun easier. It doesn’t actually get inserted into the gun. Assault rifle: A purely military term used to describe a particular type of rifle. The U.S. military defines it as a magazine fed select fire rifle, capable of full-auto or burst fire, which fires an intermediate power cartridge. Assault gun: Rarely used these days, an assault gun is a self-propelled gun, intended to fire explosive shells. It’s intended to support infantry when assaulting fortified targets such as buildings, bunkers, etc. The most well known is probably the German Sturmgeschutz used in WWII, which literally means “Assault Gun”. Assault weapon: An entirely fictitious term that was fabricated by the anti-gun left to describe a non-existent classification of firearms. It’s intended to make the uninformed public, who don’t know any better, believe that certain types of guns are somehow more dangerous and menacing than other similar ones. They seek to make people afraid of guns. Fear has always been a good motivator when used by corrupt governments.

Do you think it makes a big difference if you get Coke or Pepsi?","output":"YES - it makes a big difference to the person ordering! I personally don’t care for Diet Pepsi, and prefer Diet Coke. I always appreciate it when a server asks, “We have Pepsi, is that ok?” Then I’ll decline and get something different. It’s like asking for a scotch and getting vodka instead. Yes, it’s alcohol, but no, it does NOT taste the same! I had a friend who worked for Pepsi and was posted to a high-level marketing position in Atlanta. (In Atlanta, because Coca-Cola has their worldwide headquarters here and are HUGE philanthropists in the community, that deserves combat pay!) When we would go out to eat, he would be VERY particular about the vodka, because he wanted the brand that’s under the Pepsi umbrella. We always laughed a bit, because occasionally the server would say, “We don’t have that, we have (blah, blah, blah), would you like one of those?” Then the poor server would get a mini-lecture on how they should carry the Pepsi brand. Never mind that the restaurant served Coca-Cola products. In Atlanta. Literally, in the shadow of the world headquarters and across the street from The World of Coke. There’s a popular story in Atlanta that Emory University (who has STRONG financial ties to the Coca-Cola founders) once had a contractor who was building a large, new building on campus. For his workers, he arranged for a drink machine to be installed for their use. The supplier brought in a Pepsi machine and installed it. Less than 24 hours later, they were un-installing it, after the Powers That Be at Emory explained the facts of life to the contractor — no way were they going to have a Pepsi machine on that campus, period."},{"instruction":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","output":"I don’t want to say anything yet.

Finally, there’s the preparation he made right before the battle, recording that message for Pepper and Morgan, half expecting that he might not survive the final battle. I can’t believe that Tony, as impulsive as he could be, would reflect so heavily on altering the fundamental understanding of the universe, or risk his own life or that of his family’s, just to get revenge on Steve for something he had no direct involvement in.

And they turn out to be very high. Creationists, bless their simple hearts, like to spout nonsense that the odds of a protein like hemoglobin just appearing out of a soup of amino acids are so low, in the entire lifetime of a billion billion universes end to end we would still not expect it to happen. But of course, in reality we didn’t go from “soup of amino acids” to “hemoglobin” in one step. Imagine that you have 10,000 dice. You would’ve never expect to roll all 10,000 dice and get 10,000 sixes. Not in a billion lifetimes of the universe. Ah, but that’s not how evolution works. Imagine that you roll 10,000 dice. Every one that comes up 6, you keep. You only re-roll the ones that don’t come up 6. Now you can expect to end up with 10,000 sixes rather quickly."},{"instruction":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble. Should I sit in on his class for a day?","output":"Despite other answers, mine is absolutely NOT! With today’s technology, sit in on his classroom virtually. You could do more harm than good by showing up and sitting in on your sons classes for all his peers to witness. Whether elementary or high school, students deal with A LOT of stress and pressures. When ‘Mommy’ comes to sit in their child’s class, all they’re doing is painting a big target on their child’s back. Kids can be really cruel, and that’s DEFINITELY not a door you should open! By doing a virtual ‘visit’ in your son’s classroom you’ll achieve the same results as if you were actually there, but only you, your son, and his teacher will know about it. If your son is acting up in school as much as you say, you could actually cause him to act up even worse.

In this case it is getting a bit tricky. Several brutal tips can helps though. ENTJs can’t stop. They have difficulty managing energy wisely and usually overextend themselves. They seldom need time for rest and they can go for days if get engaged in stimulating extroverted activities. That can result in a sudden but short energy collapse. ENTJs restore themselves fast and get back to normal. Their active/sleep regime looks rapid when they get overexcited with something.INTJs usually do take time to recharge no matter how exciting the project or activity is. Their active/sleep regime looks more regular. Otherwise, they rest a lot on the week-ends. This is the key difference between the two types.ENTJs have Fi for inferior function which means they seldom talk how they really feel or they may underestimate the personal impact of their actions on others.INTJs have Se as inferior function that can result in getting overloaded with factual data, detailed information, getting engaged in sensual pleasures or caught up in outbursts of anger/childish rebells. Inferior function comes into play under stress. So, if you are more likely to never talk how you really feel under stress and you run around like an Energizer until you run out of your energy - you are ENTJ. If, you have more or less regular sleep habits because your body needs to, and under stress you are more likely to eat couple pizzas or burst into anger, you are INTJ. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","output":"Dune by Frank HerbertNeuromancer by William GibsonThe Time Machine by H.G.

While the Rigveda basically centers around divinities like Indra and Agni, other Vedic texts like the Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, and Brahmanas notice gods related with perspectives ascribed to Lord Shiva. Rudra, for instance, is a god associated with obliteration and mending, and later developed into Lord Shiva in Hindu folklore. While the notice of Ruler Shiva by name isn't express in the Rigveda, gods related with his credits show up in Vedic texts.

Or should I spend all four days in Lisbon?","output":"4 days in Lisbon gives you an idea of the city. But although Lisbon is a medium sized European capital, most of your exploring will be done by foot. Remember that Lisbon is a very hilly city, so it will take up much more of your time when compared to a similar sized but flat city. You will also take more time to rest and have s drink or two while you’re at it. It is after all the reason you’re here! You’ll have very little time to explore the surroundings of Lisbon, and there is plenty to see there. I wouldn’t recommend at all splitting your time. You could spend your 4 days in Lagos (one of my favorites in the Algarve, great beaches), and then come back to Lisbon with more time on your hands."},{"instruction":"React Native ready for production?","output":"React Naïve caters mobile applications for iOS and Android and is an open-source JavaScript framework. ReactJS developers can write code for mobile applications due to the presence of an enormous JavaScript library. Why ReactJS Development? This framework was built by Facebook in early 2015. it had been introduced to make native powered by React. React native hasn’t been used just by Facebook, but also many other Tech Giants like Walmart, Wix, Microsoft, and Shopify. Following are the factors which will inspire you to use this framework for your web app or to integrate a replacement functionality in your current app. 1. Declarative interface The ideas of component-oriented architecture and declarative UI have changed the front-end development. Huge applications are being built by the frontend developers that have reduced bugs. The motive by which React works is “Learn once, use anywhere”. This approach has made it a necessity for its growth. Isn’t it great to leverage of these elements while creating a mobile solution? There are fewer bugs during a more controlled UI. If developers are conversant in React, they will aid the event of apps. If considered carefully, developers can reuse many codes altogether over the React renderers that has web, mobile, VR, and Unity. 2. Cross-platform Compatible Moving fast in today’s world isn't just an option for the tech companies, it's essential. thanks to enormous competition, companies are inclined to grow faster with improved stability. It is tough for one company to manage three different operating systems – iOS, Android, and web front for a private product. it's not only costly supported its price but also can slow the product’s growth. This framework constitutes up to 95% of its code across Android and iOS. within the growing agile approach, this will be an enormous benefit. You can also share a codebase with the online of this framework. this may be discussed within the next section. 3. Highly Reliable All the primary releases of this framework, which is open-sourced, are tested on Facebook’s production apps. this is often where other companies get their motivation to form their app most updated and equipped with the newest version. To undergo an upgrade of any framework or tool isn’t easy for huge applications but when it's already tested at Facebook, other apps can pop right in with none hold or hesitation. 4. Adopted by Tech Tycoons This framework has been employed by many technology companies, aside from getting used extensively at Facebook. This comprises Microsoft that are using RN as brownfield and greenfield both the kinds of ReactJS development. Moreover, Shopify and Walmart have also used RN for his or her mobile App. Many apps are using RN in production lately . 5. Fast Progress Many features have shifted with RN. a real influence has been recorded by these features on the debugging, performance, and project management. 6. Hermes has an Improved JavaScript Runtime Hermes may be a JavaScript engine meant for RN, introduced by Facebook in mid-2019. The team that worked on Hermes worked a year long. it's not only helped to require the advantage of RN apps, but there are many other benefits yet to return . RN has faced immense criticism supported its performance on the lower-version of Android tools. ReactJS development depends on JavaScript because it may be a JavaScript-based framework. WebKit JSC which was employed by RN and after analysis, it had been considered to be a primary component within the startup process. Hermes makes the RN apps run faster and smoother because instead of compiling JavaScript on startup it precompiled JavaScript on the startup into byte code. This also reduces runtime and minimizes the APK volume. 7. Enhanced Debugging Even though this framework is popular amongst the developer community offering great experience, debugging the software has been painstakingly difficult for them. The ability to fast change the load code may be a benefit to use RN over other native app creation. Often it's known for its Hot Module exchange and fast reload but often it did not do so and annoyed many developers. But fast refresh features have removed this drawback. One of the simplest updates to RN is Flipper. It comes after the Fast Refresh and goes to vary the whole debugging system for RN apps. It also features DevTools v4 which suggests developers can include its amazing features with this framework also. 8. Lighter and straightforward to Manage There was a project haunted by the core team during this framework that pledged to chop down all the interface elements and inbuilt modules into a definite repository. Most of those pools fall into the react community. It is lightweight and straightforward to manage if it removes of these components and modules from itself. 9. Caring and helping the Community You need to always check the responsiveness of an application’s performance to scrolling, gestures, and animations. Several good modules are coming during this genre because of the React Native’s amazing community. It includes react-native reanimated, screens, Recycler ListView, and react native gesture handler to call a couple of . to form the navigation in apps smoother and improve the developer experience, navigation and native navigation are really working hard. 10. Single Solution for Several Platforms App development on React Native helps the developers to use the once written code anywhere. This code also can run on many various platforms like Android and iOS. For the implementation and execution of ReactJS, this framework utilizes Facebook’s UI library of Facebook to make simple codes. a number of the items that you simply would wish to make an excellent RN app are APIs, hybrid app design and development that focuses on native UI elements. 11. Cost and Resource Efficient This framework is popular for its scalability and adaptability . This framework provides you with a smooth experience and speed. While development it minimized the value and recouped the time by almost 70% using this framework. Still it helps you create an app without compromising quality. 12. Can Convert an internet Page into Mobile App This framework reuses code on two platforms by just updating it once. This framework is intuitive. The repository of codes that are employed by the app are often easily understood by the developer. The framework also makes identifying bugs between codebases easier. When transforming sites into an app, of these factors help the developer to save lots of time. Synopsis Hopefully, these top 12 reasons have offered you a transparent picture of what RN is and why it's such a lot used and loved by developers for creating the mobile apps. Hence, if you would like to customize your app or want to make a replacement one, hire ReactJS Development Company. it'll offer you user-friendly and seamless user-experience."},{"instruction":"What is chutiya in Hindi?","output":"Actually chutiye means fool (bewkoof )but some people relates it to whom, who is the fond of pussy. But it is not quite correct."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","output":"The greatest cars of all time - The below list is my personal favorite, and i think it’s the best list ever. Benz Motorwagen Created in 1886 and powered by an internal combustion engine, the Motorwagen was essentially the world’s first motor car (previous automobiles were powered by steam or electricity). Only 25 were built, and the four-stroke engine that powered the early models produced less than one horsepower. Despite its meager speeds, the vehicle paved the way for the future of cars as we know them today. Waverly Electric Anyone who thinks electric cars are an invention of the twenty-first century is sorely mistaken. The Waverly Electric was produced from 1896 to 1914 and was owned by celebrities, such as Diamond Jim Brady, Willa Cather, and Thomas Edison among its owners. Marketed as a woman-friendly automobile, The Waverly was easy to start, easy to drive, and usually came with an enclosed coach body to protect long skirts from dirt and debris. Ford Model T Part of the collection at the Gateway Auto Museum, the Model T (or “Tin Lizzy,” as Henry Ford called it) influenced every single automobile that came after it because of its groundbreaking and more cost-effective assembly-line production method. Between 1908 and 1927, 15 million models were produced. The increase of motorists as a direct result of this first affordable car led to the creation of America’s highways, gas stations, garages, and roadside motels. VW Beetle Marketed as a car that anyone could afford, the Volkswagen Beetle has been in production since 1936 and has a somewhat scandalous origin story (developed with the help of Ferdinand Porsche, the Beetle was the brainchild of Adolph Hitler, which is ironic, given it later came to be known as the “Love Bug. This compact car had several notable innovations that set it ahead of its time, including rear-wheel drive and a rear-mounted engine. It was also the first car to have four-wheel independent suspension. To date, more than 21 million Beetles have been built, making it one of the most produced cars in history. Cord L-29 The coolest car you’ve never heard of, the Cord L-29 was the first front-wheel-drive automobile sold in America. Introduced in 1929 and featuring a radically different arrangement of the engine and transaxle assembly, the L-29 had an elegant design that elevated it above its competitors. Unfortunately, the timing of the release coincided with the stock market crash of 1929, and after a few years, the L-29 was taken out of production. You can see a sister model – a 1936 Cord Phaeton – on display in the museum. Ford 150 Pickup Truck Introduced in 1948 to replace car-based pickups of the early ’40s, the F150 is now in its 13th generation thanks to its durability and reliability. Refined over the decades in styling, design, bed, engine design, suspension, and platform, it has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States since 1982 and the best-selling pickup truck since 1977. Oldsmobile F-88 Throughout the ’50s, General Motors hosted auto shows that displayed fancy prototypes and concept cars. But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby. Porsche 911 The Porsche 911 has been beloved on the racetrack and streets alike ever since it was first introduced in 1964 and is now one of the longest-standing sports cars ever. Air-cooled with an output of 130 horsepower and sophisticated rear suspension, as well as a horizontally opposed six-cylinder power plant engine, its continuous refinements over the years make it one of the most popular sports cars on the roads. In 1999, the 911 came in fifth place in the international “Car of the Century” competition – behind other notables on this list, like the Ford Model T, the Volkswagen Beetle, and the BMC Mini.

What might be best for me may not be for you .. the best firearm is the one you are comfortable with , have confidence using , can effectively hit your target ..in the venue you will be using it . You need to get out on a range and see what feel right to you . thats the best - you have to be honest asking yourself questions first before you can determine what you need ( not what you want ) , what could go wrong - how will I use this weapon - who else is in the home / over penetration - how is your home set up , the distances you’ll be engaging if so , ..can i wait it out allowing the intruder to come to me , taking a shot ( if you have to ) setting up a scenario where you know you can make a clean comfortable shot , in a safe position for all in your family ..

And with the .410 ’00′ buck shot , she is very proficient as well - The irony being I , her brother ..have over twenty high end quality pistols she could use indefinitely, far better suited for home defense ,…. and she prefers a single shot mil-spec flare pistol .. because she is comfortable with it .( which is best for her )"},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

I don’t know a lot about him.","output":"His Holiness Dalai Lama is an institution in itself. The words that he speaks somehow corelates with what inner peace is all about & let me tell you this is the most relevant thing in 21st CE. I had a rough idea about how decent human he is & has won Noble peace prize which indirectly tells you how much influential he is across globe. I watched a movie 7 years in Tibet starring Brad Pitt & is a story about Austrian Hitchhiker Heinrich Harrier, after watching this movie my inclination towards His Holiness changed more positively. This movie showcases how an arrogant human being so dominant in nature or i would say selfish completely transforms when he meets His Holiness Dalai Lama. Now I know what movie portrays is actually very much different than reality but it is based on true story & somehow I felt more connected, not because of good direction, acting but because of how sober Buddhism religion is. If you see His Holiness past history, he came as refugee in India because his life was in threat in Tibet due to Chinese Communist ideology to forcibly acquire Tibet. Just think for a while about the history of Buddhism that had been cultivated across generations in Tibet & leaving all that behind & starting a new life in India’s Mcleodganj. Just think how much sacrifices His Holiness would have made. If you see selection procedure as how Dalai Lama is elected is a very opaque process. If I am right His Holiness was a son of poor farmer & got elected to seat when he was just 2 years old. At this tender age he was a spiritual deity. The amount of expectations that Tibetan community would have & resembling with Buddha’s incarnation would have never been easy for 2 year toddler. I respect him because of positivity that he radiates across people. His Holiness has some form of different charm that separates human from god. The only difference is that I don’t see halo behind His Holiness with my naked eye but when I see through my inner peace His Holiness is no other than reality Buddha."},{"instruction":"Which is the best travel portal development company?","output":"So many travel portal development companies providing best technology to travel agents [LINKED_TEXT: etravos] [URL: https://www.etravos.com/travelportaldevelopment-india.html] is one of the best travel portal development company in india has been at the forefront at technology They are Providing [LINKED_TEXT: white labeled] [URL: https://www.etravos.com/travelportaldevelopment-india.html] and[LINKED_TEXT: customize solutions] [URL: https://www.etravos.com/travelportaldevelopment-india.html] for the travel agents Travel Portal Development in India [LINKED_TEXT: eTravos ] [URL: https://www.etravos.com/travelportaldevelopment-india.html]had been dedicated towards the cause of travel industry for some time now.

The patient was donating their kidney to their loved one and I was the scrub nurse on the harvest. Once the kidney was out, one of the two surgeons on the case told me to go over and watch the other surgeon prepare the kidney for the recipient. I was standing there, being careful to maintain sterile technique, when suddenly I heard a flurry of foul language that surgeon was not known for using. I looked up, his face was covered in blood and more blood was spraying from the wound. One of the ties they had put on the renal vessels had let go and the high-pressure blood flow from the renal vein was now spraying his face, his body, and what seemed like half the room. I ran back to my post, started handing off as many sponges as I could to let him try and absorb some of the blood, handed over the suction to the other surgeon who had now rejoined us, and quickly counted more sponges from the circulating nurse as well as clamps I’d never seen or heard the name of (as it was only my third day in renal). The circulating team brought in a cell saver so they could maybe suction the patient's blood into the machine and transfuse it directly back into him and the blood bank was called to send the packed cells that were on hold for him. It was just a fury of activity and noise. At one point, the surgeon called for an aorta clamp. I had five or six large clamps on my table and no idea which was which since I’d never used large vessel clamps before, so I just grabbed them all and prayed the one he wanted was on top. It was. They were able to clamp the vessel, tie it off again — this time tighter, and all was well again. It may sound like this took a long time but, in reality, from the beginning of the cursing to everything being under control was 7 to 10 minutes. The patient was fine and didn’t even need the cell saver. They may have given him a bag of packed cells; I’m not sure if he even needed those."},{"instruction":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","output":"Not me, but one of my best friends.

For the brain to be able to see beyond what it is hardwired to, You need to direct it to do so! Without such exclusive permission, the brain will always present to you a Probability rather than the Whole Truth. This feature of the brain to thrive on Probability, is in itself a fallacy. To a non-introspective individual, a series of such projected probabilities could sum up as lies told to them by their brain. Indian Quorans should be able to identify with this childhood experience… From the mother's pressure cooker whistle, to the steam of water being boiled for drinking, from the vapour let off by a pressing iron, to the smog of wood burnt as campfire during winters.. As kids, we end up associating smoke with extreme heat. This is merely the brain categorising ‘smoke’ into anti-survival compartment. So, the first time we notice an official from Municipal Corporation shooting mosquito repellent smoke through his fumigation [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #fIfcE] gun, we take cover in our homes. Only when the smoke eventually enters our houses, do we experience that this smoke is barely warm to touch.This theory holds good even for things the brain assumes ‘safe’ for us, but which aren't so in reality! Our brain works on default programming. It is a survival mechanism that actually helps us sail through our lives without having to instruct our brain at every single instance about a prospective danger or an opportunity that boosts chances of survival. This reduces stress and prevents premature ageing of our body. Though, we see how this Default Programming creates Prejudice. Our brain may raise a false alarm or ‘lie’ to us about certain things being conducive or unfavourable to our existence, when they actually aren't so in reality, leading us to take ‘blind’ decisions that we may never opt for in a fully informed scenario.

You’ll know what I mean if you’ve ever gone into a job search/recruitment site and typed in “business analyst”. Just like the myriads of answers in this thread - the reality is there is no one standard list of responsibilities for a BA. The role and responsibilities of a business analyst will differ depending on the following factors: Organisation size: a smaller organisation, due to budget constraints, is more likely to look for an all-rounder BA - someone who can do not just “business analysis” but also be able to cover the tasks of a project manager, a data analyst, a systems/technical analyst and sometimes even a coder/developer. Compare that to a larger organisation with more budget and larger scale projects - chances are they can afford a bigger project team/s with specialist roles such as project manager, process analyst, systems analyst, data analyst, change manager etc.Complexity of scope: similar to the above point, for a project with a low complexity, chances are the client will expect a BA to be able to cover all bases whereas a more complex scope may have more budget to hire specialist roles in the project team.Organisational understanding of BA role: this refers to the level of maturity and understanding of project work in an organisation. I find that organisations who haven’t had exposure to change and project work, will have very different expectations or maybe don’t even know what expectations to have when it comes to a BA role. They can be on either end of the spectrum i.e. they either don’t know what value a BA can bring to their organisation OR they expect too much out of a BA. What that means is: Not every BA will have to “develop” requirements. You’ll still need to understand and work with requirements but you may not have to physically write it yourself (if there are other technical/systems analysts on the team).Not every BA is expected to know SQL, Power BI, complex modelling etc. If you work in a small - medium sized organisation, their data won’t be as big or as complex as a large organisation and so you might be able to get away with just being really good at Excel.Not every BA needs to write user stories, develop process maps, manage vendors, manage testing, deliver training etc. etc. For those starting out in the BA career, I would highly recommend looking for Junior BA positions where you can be part of a larger project team so that you can have the opportunity to learn, observe, ask questions, practice etc. If you are flying solo in your first BA role, I would encourage you to join a community or build a network who can help and support you through that initial stage when you’re still finding your feet. Trust me, what you learn from a “course” will help you understand frameworks and methodologies but it won’t give you a roadmap for what you need to do when you actually land your first job as a BA."},{"instruction":"What is it like being a farmer?

Here are some common reasons why individuals are drawn to HRM: Interest in people and their development: Many individuals are naturally inclined towards understanding and working with people. They enjoy helping others, resolving conflicts, and supporting individuals in their personal and professional growth. HRM offers opportunities to work closely with employees, assisting them in their career development, and fostering a positive work environment.Passion for organizational success: HR professionals play a crucial role in shaping an organization's culture, building effective teams, and optimizing human capital. They are motivated by contributing to the success and growth of the organization through strategic HR initiatives, such as talent acquisition, performance management, and employee engagement programs.Desire for continuous learning and development: HRM is a field that is constantly evolving due to changes in employment laws, workforce demographics, and emerging HR practices. Individuals who enjoy learning, staying updated on industry trends, and adapting to new challenges find HRM appealing. HR professionals have the opportunity to develop their skills in areas such as recruitment, training and development, labor relations, and HR analytics.Advocacy for fairness and employee well-being: HRM provides an avenue for individuals who are passionate about advocating for fairness, equity, and employee well-being in the workplace. HR professionals are involved in areas such as employee relations, conflict resolution, and ensuring compliance with labor laws and regulations. They have the opportunity to create inclusive and supportive work environments that prioritize the well-being and rights of employees.Impact on organizational strategy and decision-making: HR professionals who are interested in contributing to strategic decision-making and organizational planning find HRM attractive. They have the opportunity to align HR strategies with business objectives, shape talent management strategies, and provide insights on human capital issues that can directly influence organizational success.Dynamic and diverse work experiences: HRM offers a diverse range of responsibilities and the opportunity to interact with individuals at all levels of the organization. HR professionals collaborate with different departments, handle various HR functions, and work on projects with cross-functional teams. This dynamic nature of HRM can be appealing to individuals who enjoy variety in their work experiences. Ultimately, the reasons for building a career in HRM can vary from person to person. It's important to assess your own interests, values, and aspirations to determine if a career in HRM aligns with your passion and goals. Exploring HR internships, speaking with HR professionals, and researching HR roles and responsibilities can provide further insights into the field and help you make an informed career decision."},{"instruction":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","output":"That's an interesting self-own.

Hayes] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kelsey-L-Hayes], Quora'a doyenne of all things Planetos, in saying that they should have kept more careful track of various plot elements and character developments earlier on and not muddled or neglected so many of those, most especially that of the fall of Dany from heroine to villain. I think the common thread of all those bungled elements is an overemphasis on commercial exploitation and pandering to fans over the actual demands of the story and fidelity to (what we presume was) GRRM'a original outline. The biggest screw up was of course the heart of the saga- the Song of Ice and Fire as embodied by Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen- and the obvious requirement that Daenerys, as a supposed heroine who looked like a traditional fantasy protagonist, had to turn out to be a monster in the end. GRRM subverts tropes of traditional fantasy and sci-fi. He uses the conventions of writers of modern speculative fiction to tell stories about how people are fearful, selfish, flawed, and conflicted. And it's true, the requirements of drama and the human heart demand that we look for and receive heroes, even if they are grubby ones, but the kind of realism Martin aims for has always been about showing you what looks like a classic hero or heroine and then revealing them to be a character that is far, far from perfect <cough, sisterfuckin’, kingslayin’ Jaime Lannister, cough cough>. So of course Daenerys was going to turn out to be a destroyer of innocents. Her story began perfectly for that subversion- an innocent who then inspiringly becomes a liberator of other innocents. But power and self righteousness corrupt, and there was no way GRRM wasn't going to tell that story. The producers of the show consciously chose to ignore that character arc, which, to be clear, they absolutely knew about beforehand, in favor of pandering to Dany fans. If they had begun to clearly telegraph he fall from grace, they'd have risked imperiling the streams of Twitter love, t-shirt sales, and babies who would live with the name Khaleesi their whole dang lives. They should have settled the War for the Dawn at least a season earlier. It does seem likely that this plot line will be much closer to the resolution of the struggle for the Iron Throne in the books, perhaps with Daenerys betraying Jon or his followers more directly, but it also is reasonable that the demands of TV would require a more spaced out development of the final slide of the once lauded heroine into villainy."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"TechGropse is a well-known Mobile App Development Company that offers high-quality mobile app development services at a modest pace.

Knowing the law and rules of court procedure are paramount. You do not say what type of case this is…if it is criminal then you will lose. If it is traffic then try this: If you absolutely insist on making the mistake of representing yourself go to court at least once before your scheduled trial date and observe trials for cases similar to yours. Take notes on how defenses are handled…both good and bad. Then, plan your defense before you go to court. Prepare relevant questions to ask that will perhaps indirectly undermine the prosecution’s claims by removing some necessary element of the offense or that such element could have been observed by a testifying witness.

However, it is evident that depression rates have increased among younger generations in recent years. Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of depression in this generation: Social Media and Technology: The rise of social media and digital technology has significantly impacted the lives of young people. While social media platforms offer connectivity and communication, they can also contribute to feelings of isolation, comparison, and low self-esteem. Constant exposure to carefully curated highlight reels of others' lives can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy.Academic Pressure: The current generation faces immense academic pressure and competition. The pursuit of high grades, college admissions, and future career prospects can lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of being overwhelmed. The pressure to excel can take a toll on mental health and contribute to the development of depressive symptoms.Economic Uncertainty: Young adults today often face economic uncertainty, including high student loan debts, difficulties finding stable employment, and concerns about financial stability. The stress and anxiety associated with financial pressures can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and depression.Increased Awareness and Diagnosis: There has been a positive shift in mental health awareness, leading to more open discussions and reduced stigma surrounding depression. As a result, more individuals are seeking help and receiving accurate diagnoses. The increased prevalence of diagnosed cases may contribute to the perception of higher depression rates in this generation.Changing Social Dynamics: Changes in family structures, community engagement, and social support systems have influenced the mental health landscape. Fragmented family dynamics, increased urbanization, and a sense of disconnection from traditional support systems can contribute to feelings of loneliness and depression. It is important to note that while these factors may contribute to the higher prevalence of depression, each individual's experience is unique. Depression is a complex condition with various biological, psychological, and environmental factors at play. Addressing the issue requires a comprehensive approach that focuses on mental health education, access to quality mental health care, and supportive environments. Encouraging open conversations about mental health, providing resources and support systems, and promoting self-care and resilience-building strategies can help mitigate the impact of depression on this generation. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, it is essential to seek professional help. Qualified mental health professionals can provide the necessary support, treatment options, and coping strategies to navigate the challenges and promote overall well-being. Remember, you are not alone, and there is help available to support you through your journey towards mental health and happiness.

It is often used to evaluate the performance of regression models. To calculate the MAE, you can follow these steps: Collect your dataset: Make sure you have a set of actual values (ground truth) and their corresponding predicted values. For example, you might have a set of actual housing prices and their corresponding predicted prices.Calculate the absolute error: For each data point, subtract the predicted value from the actual value, and take the absolute value of the difference. This will give you the absolute error for each data point.Absolute Error = |Actual Value - Predicted Value|Compute the average: Take the average of all the absolute errors calculated in the previous step. You can do this by summing up all the absolute errors and dividing the sum by the total number of data points.MAE = (1/n) * Σ(Absolute Error)Where n is the total number of data points in your dataset.Interpret the result: The MAE value represents the average magnitude of the errors in your predictions. It is measured in the same units as the original data. A lower MAE indicates better model performance, as it means the predicted values are closer to the actual values on average. Note: The MAE does not consider the direction of the errors, meaning it treats overpredictions and underpredictions equally. If you want to give more weight to larger errors, you might consider using other metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE)."},{"instruction":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","output":"It is not possible with 103 folds but yes with 104 folds it is possible Let me do a quick calculation..

However, it's important to be aware that some people may be allergic to aloe vera gel or may experience skin irritation from using it. It's always a good idea to do a patch test on a small area of skin before applying aloe vera gel all over your face, especially if you have sensitive skin or a history of allergic reactions. Additionally, if you have oily or acne-prone skin, applying aloe vera gel overnight may not be the best option as it could clog your pores and worsen your acne. In these cases, it's best to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to find the best products and skincare routine for your skin type.

Why don't the UK people be less racist and welcome Meghan Markle?","output":"You cannot change culture overnight, even if people are forced to act differently or keep their feelings to themselves. Many are mistaken that a hundred or two hundred years is a very long time, which it is in terms of technology, but it's only a handful of generations whereby values and beliefs are passed on effortlessly by parents to children. Knowing Britain in various regions and different family classes, Victorian and in some places medieval cultural values are still very present. Values developed based on Empire and relations to various ethnic groups around the world are still very much at large. Society is made from its history. Meghan has contradicted historic trends. Someone with her appearance and parentage would be illegal in some places in the United States before the mid-60s, if not scorned and to have any kind of status would enter the history books as an anomaly. To be married to a Royal family member is downright shocking to a Victorian or a pre-2010 mindset! It wouldn't be possible perhaps if it wasn't for trendsetters like rebellious Diana and Kate the commoner. Though the late Queen and Crown approved Meghan and Harry’s marriage, many others are not comfortable with the idea. Many are fuming! I've never witnessed such hate towards any one person in my life in Britain. Meghan hasn't done anything wrong but her haters say she's ‘not a nice person’ and there is a whole book or two saying how so. I'm absolutely amazed at some answers, questions and anti-Meghan spaces here on Quora. So much talent for spite, nasty implications and hateful imagination. I think what disturbs me about the British-Meghan-haters is they try to sound reasonable, justifiable, factual, sincerely disappointed, were generously open arms initially, took time to find out what she was really like and of course not as good as Kate, unlike Kate for example, we give everyone a chance and judge people on the character. I would dare to say, that when Meghan-Haters first learned of her and saw the very early pictures of the couple together; they instantly ignited and blew up in red mist as the green-eyed monster of envy. When they saw she wasn't going to apologise for her existence and not be forever grovelling because of her relatively lowly and foreign station and forever flattering the perfect people of Britain and being overwhelmed by the most tolerant and non-racist people on the planet who are often too nice for their good. Maybe they wanted her to treat her black heritage like an unfortunate disease, never mention it and be forever grateful no one else doesn't remind her of it either, like an elephant in the palace. Harry and Meghan both know that there are fans and accepting people of Britain, but also know the media, establishment, and hating cowardly crowds with nothing else better to do and would rather have Prince Andrew for tea than Meghan. Although all said is obvious to many, people are still perplexed and upset that the couple with children, don't want to visit the UK. Protecting two very young children from Britain is a full-time job in itself. How will Meghan and Harry tell their children about his family and their blood relatives, that they have used the vile press against them and there are populations to be avoided at all costs because they say, ‘Meghan is not a nice person?!’ If Shakespeare was around today he wouldn't have written Romeo and Juliette. Here is a story exposing more vile elements of human nature. He missed his opportunity. Perhaps aspects of Othello and Hamlet and the witches of Macbeth could all be rolled into this play.

I am not sure about the price but based on my conversations with those who lived and eaten those meals, I guess they were just a few rupees making restaurant food affordable to all citizens across the nation! This mentality of not having to tolerate hungry citizens in itself is worth appreciation and I admire Indira Gandhi for the same. In the same note, Jayalalitha introduced Amma restaurants/canteen where affordably priced food was made available at a time when eating outside is not an option for many. Jayalalitha deserves the admiration for institutionalizing what Indira did back then. Fast forward to now, Amma canteens are shut down or are supplying to local restaurants such that Amma restaurant employees’ daily job is to transport the entire kitchen output to local restaurants and spending the rest of the day marking multiple bills to account for the same being sold to many citizens! To be fair, nobody even remembers ‘Janata Meals’ now! Both Indira Gandhi and Jayalalitha are equally strong when it came to intolerance of citizens’ hunger. Indira Gandhi took strong steps to bring down the khalistan movement and the golden temple hostage situation had to be dealt with deadly force. Indira Gandhi knew that move would make the Sikhs hate her guts but she did it anyway as her intolerance for violation of constitution on that scale superseded all of her other political passions, however unfair they may be. When Operation BlueStar ended, her advisors asked her to replace the Sikh security guards and she boldly denied it, trusting them! That in my view, makes Indira Gandhi many folds stronger than Jayalalitha! Jayalalitha was paranoid about people trying to kill her. She spent a good amount of her adult life walking around with a bullet-proof vest and odd-looking cloak/coat to cover that up. One news of someone trying to poison her and she had them removed from her home/party etc! Her concern for her own safety is her right but the way she responded makes her weaker than Indira Gandhi! Jayalalitha wasn’t entirely wrong about her suspicion of those around her but she did not brave the storm as Indira who had the guts to take the risk and trust her Sikh security guards. Strong leadership comes with strong levels of trust in self and others irrespective of prognostic knowledge of risks. Indira beats Jayalalitha left right and center. I think, I’ve made my point."},{"instruction":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble.

Here are some of the differences between the two natural stones. 1. Granite originates from the solidification and cooling of magma deep within the earth. It solidifies throughout millions of years and is classified as an igneous rock because of its origin from the cooling down of molten magma. During the process of heating and then slow cooling, granite forms as an exceedingly hard material. Granite for kitchen countertops: Granite is naturally quite sturdy and hard which makes it ideal for kitchen countertops. So if you place a heavy utensil or a hot pot on top, it will not result in damage. 2. Marble originates from sedimentary rocks. These rocks are formed from sediments in the earth combined with buried plant life under the earth over a long period. Marbles are metamorphosed into marble under intense heat and pressure. During this process, other minerals incorporate into the marble that can give the latter varying attractive colours. Marble for kitchen countertops is a famous choice. Marble adds an expensive and royal feel to kitchen designs. However, it is less durable than granite as marble is a softer stone.

Pros of buying marrow notes: 1) Ready-made notes 2) Made by a professional institute, so has to be proof read and an integration of different ideas. 3) Handwriting like handwritten notes 4) Main points highlighted with red and green. 5) Integration of tables and flowcharts for required topics. 6) Image based notes, with illustrations and pictures to support the notes. 7) Time saving 8) Easier to understand and watch the videos while referring to the notes. 9) Workspaces for adding our own additional points. 10) Important headings have time stamps, so can refer to the video at those times for later revision, without watching the whole video. 11) Difficult subjects for us, can be simplified at times with help of notes. Cons of buying marrow notes: 1) Will have to shell out money. 2) No touch of personalisation to notes. 3) Can feel like a textbook due to printed material. 4) May have to read the notes multiple times for better retainment. 5) Format of notes may not be to our liking, so hard to relate and understand. Now having discussed the pros and cons of both the situations, Let’s try to arrive at an integrated solution. I personally feel that if you can afford it, it’s best to buy the marrow notes and then watch the videos for maximum output for the following reasons: 1) We can use highlighters and highlight points of our choice and jot down additional points beside the printed text. This saves time and we can personalize the notes. 2) In places where we feel like we have a better way of noting down points, there is enough space beside the notes for us to write it down the way we want. 3) You can ask, how is this different from a textbook? Marrow notes are concise with only important and relevant examination points, so it’s much more time saving than textbooks and much easier to understand and they also have corresponding videos. In case it’s expensive to buy the notes, you can start preparing them from 2nd year itself, as the earlier you start better, as time isn’t on our side. So, I would say that only if affordability is an issue, don’t buy the marrow notes. Otherwise, all the other cons can be addressed by adding our personal touch to the notes. It’s time and effort saving and can also replicate the feel and retainment of topics just as handwritten notes. Do you need it in second year itself? Getting a good head start in the race to preparation is always good, so earlier better. Hopefully this was useful in helping you decide. All the best with your preparation."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

Audiology didn’t exist as a profession in the early years of the Second World War. Not until, approximately 1943 or 1944, when an unprecedented number (hundreds of thousands) of men and women came home from the battle fields with irreversible noise induced hearing losses due to acoustic trauma, head injuries due Projectiles, brain damage due to aphasias. Overnight, the Veteran’s Administration started opening Hospital Clinics all over the United States for the rehabilitation of communication disorders. Audiology was born. The first Ph.D. in audiology was awarded at NorthWestern University in 1945. Many of these men and women went on to be evaluated, treated, and subsequently given compensation for their losses, The V.A. became the largest employer of audiologists. As time went on, however, ,ten, twenty years later, more and more, claims continued to be filed. It became evident a valid objective technique for assessing the actual degree of hearing loss was necessary. A direct measurement of hearing acuity that didn’t rely on patient response became available in the 1960’s. Evoked Potential Auditory Brainstem Response Audiometry was born, (BSER) followed almost immediately with OtoAcoustic Emmisiom (OAE) audiometry. Yet another objective test of hearing loss. These and a battery of other tests have drastically limited Functional hearing losses, psychogenic hearing losses, and outright malingering."},{"instruction":"What are some real life bad habits that MIT gives people?","output":"MIT students fall into a vicious cycle that forces you to think that if you aren't working all the time, you're wasting time.

Manmohan Singh’s Government was responding to the specific circumstances then. India faced a severe forex crisis in 1991 due to the liberalization of imports started in mid 1980s (and the borrowings from other countries by Indians who were importing these items). That has led to the liberalization of exports and also the removal license Raj. However he could not implement many other institutional reforms. Then the UPA governments headed by him increased the allocation for social sector. That was also determined by the circumstances then - coalition government; deepening of democracy; the awareness that more investments are needed in social sector; the influence of social activists and so on. One can say that Manmohan Singh was responding reasonably well to the needs of his times. In fact, the corruption allegations of his times were also an outcome of the circumstances: There was corruption in India even before. However the growth of the middle-class and the openness in the economy (facilitated by Singh) made corruption a notable issue. Narendra Modi’s regime faces certain challenges: The easier ways to boost Indian economy are no longer available; structural factors have a greater role; he and officials who work with him closely think that there are magic solutions; there is not enough consultation; there is not enough pressure to meet the needs of society; some magic solutions are tried out but correct lessons are not learnt; there is not enough reflection and discussion within the party. Hence the outcomes of his policies are not remarkable. In summary, the nature of these two individuals and the different circumstances that they are in may have shaped their policies. It is important to note that Vajpayee is did reasonably well in terms of economic policies; there was a lot more focus on developing social consensus. His nature and his circumstances (like coalition politics) might have played an important role."},{"instruction":"What is ताजमहल किस नदी के किनारे स्थित हैं?","output":"यमुना"},{"instruction":"Does the experiment that showed thoughts affecting water molecules prove that the law of attraction exists?","output":"no but the fact that attraction is real proves something totaly diffrent about the world"},{"instruction":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","output":"Don’t be panic just take Patience and to know in detail about apple iD go visit our Quora Profile where out technician shared the full details step by step to apple users so that they not facing any kind of issues or if the face can also get assistance on Article through Apple Support Chat it works 24x7 hours for customers."},{"instruction":"Why haven't we gotten a futuristic world?","output":"Why haven't we gotten a futuristic world? When I went into college, the ideas of… Using satellite images to find a lost personCommunicating with ancestors beside stone age ritual monolithsPinpointing someone’s location with radio triangulation …were products of lazy Hollywood plots. Probably something that would involve people pounding away on computer keyboards muttering things like “hacking the CIA mainframe to access the Keyhole-37B satellite.” Or a bad sword-and-sorcery movie would cover the ancestors bit. But 20 years after college, all those happened to me in one day. My brother, the adventurer, went hunting in a bit of rural Florida and left the good GPS unit in the airboat. (This being before every cellphone had Google Maps.) He and his buddies promptly got lost in the weeds and weren’t able to see the canal where they’d parked the boat. One of his buddies brought a cellphone that could report longitude and latitude in exacting detail. So, they called me. And I used their latitude and longitude on an everyday computer with everyday Google Maps and its satellite images to pinpoint their location. They’d traipse around in one direction for a while, call me with a new latitude and longitude report, and I’d verify which direction they were heading. Eventually, I got them heading to the canal and their airboat. In between those calls to the swamps of Florida, my parents called from a trip to Europe. They gave me an update on their visit to Stonehenge, standing in the middle of field far from civilization. (Sorry, Amesbury, you don’t count.) Me? I’d spent the day evaluating long-chain molecules engineered almost to the atom for their ability to armor military vehicles against hostile environments. Part of the work involved accessing much of humanity’s total knowledge, via vast libraries accessed in milliseconds through controlled pulses of light and lightning. (In other words, I was checking new paints for their corrosion resistance and trying to convince the US Army that painted metal would save them money. I had to use the internet now and then.) [LINKED_TEXT: Seaver Hodges] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-havent-we-gotten-a-futuristic-world/answer/Seaver-Hodges] made an eloquent point about the future that I liked. Jim Butcher (author of the Harry Dresden series) has another point about the world around us that’s stuck with me for years: “Sometimes the most remarkable things seem commonplace. I mean when you think about it jet travel is pretty freaking remarkable. You get in a plane and it defies the gravity of a entire planet by exploiting a loophole with air pressure and it flies across distances that would take months or years to cross by any means of travel that has been significant for more than a century or three. You hurtle above the Earth at enough speed to kill you instantly should you bump into something and you can only breathe because someone built you a really good tin can that seems tight enough to hold in a decent amount of air. Hundreds of millions of man-hours of work and struggle and research, blood, sweat, tears, and lives have gone into the history of air travel and it has totally revolutionized the face of our planet and societies. But get on any flight in the country and I absolutely promise you that you will find someone who in the face of all that incredible achievement will be willing to complain about the drinks.” I know the meme, I’ve shared it on the FaceyTweets or InstaBooks like all the cool kids… …but If you don’t think the world is futuristic enough, just imagine necromancing up an ancestor from, say, 200 years ago. Imagine trying to explain to them about holding all the world’s knowledge in one hand (smartphone), catching a ride on a vehicle that can cross an ocean in hours using tens of thousands of horsepower for a week’s wages (jet airliner), and casually getting photographs from artificial moons circling Earth."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","output":"When the economy heads toward a recession, it's natural for investors to worry about falling stock prices and the impact on their portfolios. At the same time, you may hear reports of dropping housing starts, increased jobless claims, and shrinking economic output. But what do house building and shrinking output have to do with your portfolio? And, aside from all of these risks, how does a recession affect you as an investor? Understanding the business cycle doesn't matter much unless it improves portfolio returns. What's an investor to do during a recession? The answer depends on your situation and what type of investor you are. First, remember that a bear market does not mean there's no way to make money. Some investors take advantage of falling markets by short selling stocks, meaning they make money when share prices fall and lose money when they rise. Only sophisticated investors should use this technique. How long will the bear market or recession last? We all would love to know when the economy and regular life gets back to normal, but unfortunately, there’s just no way to tell at this point. But when this does pass, there’s a good chance that our recovery will be faster compared to other downturns given the pent-up demand from so many weeks of home isolation. It’s also likely that the longer the shutdown lasts, the slower the rebound will be. Is this a good time to invest in stock markets? The continuous price decline has presented investors buying opportunities, since they can acquire the stocks more cheaply. However, the stocks might take a longer time to recover. Therefore, if you are buying into the stocks, do it for the long term. You have indicated that there are stocks you are looking to invest in. This means that you have a watch list. Watch lists help investors monitor and spot investing opportunities in the stock market. Before buying a stock, look at its historic price performance. The price decline might be attributable to price corrections like the one we saw for banking stocks earlier in the year, after they rallied following the repeal of interest rate caps, which in turn boosted investor sentiments.Although investing in the stock market is risky, it is a good move. Even so, you should not invest your money all at once. It may be more prudent to buy the stock at every price dip because it is difficult to accurately anticipate price declines in the market. Do not try to estimate that in the coming days the prices of the stock will continue to decline. If you are an investor in the stock market, with the prices continuing to decline, you may be tempted to bail on the equities market and sell your shares. Research has shown that during the 2008–2009 financial crisis, those who held onto their shares doubled their investments after the crisis was over. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in the world is known to have profited when stock prices were down.

Specially helpful for 15..."},{"instruction":"Can all Glock, MP, and other similar handguns be retrofitted with external and manual safeties?","output":"Short answer, no. They can’t. Long answer: Many of the modern crop of handguns have been engineered with safety in mind, to include Glock, S&W M&Ps, Springfield XD, and a slew of others. For comparison, I will use the 1911 series, partly for simplicity and partly because I own both a 1911 type and Springfield XDM, both in .45. The 1911 and it’s siblings, along with a good many other older styles of handguns, have their safeties engineered as a nearly separate system, to wit, the safety on a 1911 is activated by thumb lever located on the right side of the gun. It also has a strap safety built in to the grip, a passive safety of sorts that does not allow the hammer to fall unless your hand is completely on the grip, even if the manual safety is off. The safety can only be activated if the hammer is all the way back hence, what is referred to as condition 1, round in the chamber, hammer back, safety on, is the ONLY safe way to carry a 1911 with a round in the chamber. This also necessitates training to thumb the safety off as soon you draw the weapon. Doable, but it takes training…quite a bit of it. The Glock and its plastic relatives, however, have numerous safeties built right in to the gun. My Springfield has a grip safety, a trigger safety ( a sort of trigger with in the trigger), a round indicator, to indicate a chambered round, and a protrusion in the back of the gun that indicates that the gun is ready to be fired (round in the chamber or not). Without the grip safety depressed, the trigger will move, but disconnects the firing mechanism. Without the trigger safety, the trigger will not travel far enough back to engage the firing mechanism. The chamber indicator on the top of the gun rises when there’s a round in the chamber and can be felt by your finger. Some for the bump in the back to indicate the gun is ready to fire. The end result of all of this is that live round maybe safely carried in gun and less training is required to bring the weapon into operation. Simply pull and squeeze the trigger. As another example, the Berretta M9 used a double action/single action trigger that has a de-cocking lever which would allow the hammer to be lowered with out discharging the gun. Again, live round in the chamber, pull and squeeze. All of these weapons were engineered they way the were for a reason or group of reasons. The real question is, why would want to do this? The safeties built into modern handguns are more than adequate to the task, that being carrying live round, ready to fire at a moment’s notice, or, in come cases, with no notice at all. The only outcome of this would be to introduce unnecessary complexity and probably unreliability into a system that must be reliable, robust, and simple. The current design philosophy fits that parameter rather neatly. This does not impugn the 1911 design, just demonstrates how the design philosophies have changed and how the modern weapons are providing rugged, robust, simple, and reliable operation to anyone who needs it."},{"instruction":"What do hotels do with used soap?","output":"Stuff burlap sacs with it and drop them down the elevator shaft to the children that are kept in the basement as laundry workers"},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"MacBooks are not touchscreen because Apple is focusing on indirect input with their Macs.

Rapid weight loss can be challenging to sustain and may have negative effects on your body. Instead, focus on gradual, sustainable changes to your lifestyle that promote healthy weight loss. Here are some tips to get you started: Consult a Healthcare Professional: Before starting any weight loss program, consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian. They can assess your health, provide personalized advice, and ensure you're approaching weight loss in a safe manner.Create a Calorie Deficit: Weight loss occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body burns. However, extreme calorie restriction is not recommended. Aim for a moderate calorie deficit by choosing healthier foods and reducing portion sizes.Eat a Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid highly processed and sugary foods.Control Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Using smaller plates can help with portion control.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger.Limit Sugary Drinks: Avoid sugary beverages like soda and fruit juices, as they can contribute to weight gain.Be Active: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, running, or swimming) and strength training to build muscle and boost your metabolism.Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can affect hormones related to appetite and weight gain.Manage Stress: High stress levels can lead to emotional eating. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time in nature.Track Your Progress: Keep a journal or use a mobile app to track your food intake, exercise, and progress. This can help you stay accountable and make adjustments as needed.Avoid Fad Diets: Steer clear of fad diets that promise rapid weight loss but lack scientific evidence. They may be unsustainable and potentially harmful. Remember, healthy weight loss is a gradual process. [LINKED_TEXT: Aim for losing 1-2 pounds per week] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/283755/srikanthMalliswari/], which is considered a safe and sustainable rate.

I’m not gonna use the Hulk vs. Surtur fight here though because Surtur is way, way out of Kong’s league. That being said though, I think Kong may have the strength to take Hulk down. However, I’m not sure if he has the durability and speed to do so. Sure, Kong’s tough, but Hulk’s punches are definitely gonna hurt. A LOT. Hulk’s also faster and more agile due to his smaller size. I think this fight really depends on how much damage Kong can take from Hulk and how many punches Hulk would need to take Kong down. Ultimately though, after his showings against Godzilla, I think Kong (2021) can take this about 60% of the time. Skull Island Kong on the other hand, only wins this about 10% of the time. Now, Hulk vs. King Kong (again) In this fight however, Kong would be lucky to survive for even 10 seconds.

Granite Have Good Stability Granite is formed under high-temperature and condensation conditions. Due to the close inlay of minerals and the extremely small inter-particle gaps, and also the multiple tectonic movements with long-term changes in the cold and heat. Therefore, the texture of granite is extremely hard and its chemical properties are extremely stable. 2.Granite Easy To Process Although granite is hard, high surface roughness and precision can be easily obtained through processes such as sawing, grinding, polishing, and cutting. Granite is unlike many metal materials that require a series of complicated forging and cold heat treatments. Therefore, the processing equipment for granite is relatively simple, the processing cycle is relatively short, and the cost of processing the finished product is relatively low. I've only mentioned a few of the benefits of granite; if you want to learn more, you can go to this website: [LINKED_TEXT: Granite: 6 Advantages of Granite You Never Know] [URL: https://www.ampquartz.com/6-advantages-of-granite/]"},{"instruction":"w do I recover Samsung Notes on a Samsung Galaxy?","output":"In fact, the deleted photo are still stored in android phone .

My enneagram type is a 4w3. It made perfect sense to me. A type 4 is one of the most common INFJ types, with the type 9 as a close second. What does surprise me though with these two typologies, is that INFJs can and do correspond with almost all nine of the enneagram types. I have encountered just about every enneagram type and INFJ combination here on Quora. So as odd and as rare that INFJs are labeled, they sure do get around. I have often wondered if this could explain why INFJs are so misunderstood and so paradoxical. This very genius comparison of the two typologies quoted by another Quora writer explains it perfectly. The enneagram explains who we are and the MBTI explains how we are. So with this theory, INFJs can be up to nine different personalities using the same ‘tool kit’ to express how they function. Yet each and every INFJ can relate on a very deep level and recognizes the other on that level in spite of their enneagram type. I have not found this to be the case with any other MBTI type. *A2A"},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"Are bank tellers allowed to ask why you are withdrawing a lot of cash from your account?","output":"They are “allowed” to ask any question that is not harassment.

If you are facing an issue with accuracy then analyse the mistakes you are making regularly. Select a mix of questions and set a limited time to solve them like in an examination scenario where you attempt as many questions in any order within the limited time. After that check your attempts and accuracy. Then analyse the questions which went wrong and what mistakes you made by referring the solutions. Then answer the following: Are you making conceptual mistake: If yes then study the chapter again from your material and attempt 5 similar questions after that to ensure your concept is clear. If no, then check which error are you making and where. Remember this mistake so that when you attempt similar question, you consciously avoid that mistake. Attempt 5–10 questions of similar pattern by avoiding the mistake and then you’ll overcome the habit. Make sure that in both cases when you attempt the said 5–10 questions, don’t set any time limit.

You are a single cell in the field of awareness. As the impermanence of the particular vanishes then only you as the larger impersonal remains. You as the personal are a dream within the permanent impersonal. When the personal is no more then only the permanent remains as your limitless nature. The permanent is like a battery, a stationary source, timeless, changeless. Individuals leave the battery, have a life along a circular circuit, and return back to the battery.

Had an action sequence been included, then it would have felt like too much was being crammed into a single film. The pacing was good, and the scene where Darkseid sees through the boom tube after Steppenwolf dies, shows us how he understands that the complete Justice League is united and this probably isn't the best time to engage. Instead he'd come back stronger and prepared. At that moment the Justice League is in full beast mode and Darkseid wouldn't want to face an Atlantean, Kryptonian, Amazonian AND other JL members at the same time.

Only a few days old, Charlie the baby hippo was orphaned after his mother could no longer feed him. Luckily for Charlie, rescuers found him and took him to an animal orphanage in Africa, where they nursed him back to health. About a week later Makhosi the Rhino was brought to the orphanage after its mother was killed by poachers. She was very traumatised and wouldn’t settle, so they decided to put her in the pen with Charlie the Hippo. Hippo’s and Rhino’s are usually territorial and don’t normally get along. It didn’t take long for Makhosi to settle once she was in the pen with Charlie. For the first time since she arrived Makhosi was able to sleep. The Hippo and the Rhino became attached to each other which was strange because in the wild they would hate each other. Charlie followed Makhosi everywhere and even started to act like the Rhino. They did everything together, bath, eat, sleep and eventually with a Rhino for a best friend Charlie the Hippo began to believe he was a Rhino. Charlie began to hate going near the water because Makhosi would never follow him in. He would only eat when the other Rhinos ate and this was a problem, because if Charlie could never learn to be a Hippo he could never be released back into the wild. Luckily for Charlie the orphanage brought in another orphaned Hippo, a female called Moomin. It didn’t take long for Moomin to fall head over heels for Charlie and would even get upset if she saw him getting attention from some one else. The more the two Hippo’s spent together the more Charlie began acting like a Hippo. He started going back in the water and even started to eat with Moomin. Even though Charlie was a Hippo again, he didn’t forget about his friend Makhosi. They would still hang out and they still took naps under the tree together. In early 2021, Makhosi was transferred to a game reserve with another Rhino that she got close to, where they started their transition back into the wild. Charlie and Moomin where released back into the wild in February of this year, they had spent 6 years together at the orphanage."},{"instruction":"What should writers know?","output":"The first thing you need to know is that it’s okay if you don’t write every day or if other standard writing advice doesn’t work for you. Writing is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. Different people have different methods, and as long as you meet your writing goals, it’s all good. Writing also isn’t something that you can do or master quickly, though. Sometimes aspiring authors have this idea that they just have to sit down, churn out a draft, correct the grammar, and they’re ready to publish. Most of the time, it doesn’t work that way. There are days where you’re not going to know what to write or what happens next in your story (if you’re writing fiction), and after you get a draft done, you’re probably going to need to do major edits to get it ready to show the world. I encourage everyone who is a fiction writer to read Libbie Hawker’s Take Off The Pants. It’s an amazing guide to creating character driven stories that will be compelling to readers. The title comes from the idea of “Pantsers”, who are writers who write by the seat of their pants rather than writing an outline in advance. Either planning in advance or not is fine. Most of my clients are pantsers, but if you’re a plotter, go for it! Keep in mind that writing is a business, too. Publishing companies make decisions about what to publish based on what they think will be best for their business. If you indie publish, you’ll be making a lot of business decisions and will need to do marketing and advertising to get people to buy your books. (You also need to do some marketing if you are traditionally published. Query letters to agents are basically marketing letters selling yourself as a writer, and once the book is published, you shouldn’t just rely on whatever marketing the publishing company does or doesn’t do.) I also advise against expecting overnight success because it generally doesn’t work that way. Be prepared in advance for it to take time to make money writing so that you don’t get frustrated and quit prematurely. And finally, make sure to have fun along the way! Even if you’re dealing with heavy subjects in your writing, approaching the project shouldn’t be gloom and doom. You could pick up any hobby or embark on any other career, so if you’re choosing this one, it should be fun for you."},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"I learned this a bit late in life but this really helps.Learn phonetics.

I mean, people has been complaining that Marvel has been too “woke” in the second half of this decade. But, Marvel has always been the “woke” comic book publisher. I preferred DC as a kid back then, just like most other people. Yeah, what you guys experience now is entirely new thing. [LINKED_TEXT: Marvel Comics at 80: From bankruptcy to billions] [URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-49865896] It is extremely funny seeing people paying a lot of tributes to the great Marvel franchise, feeling as if Stan Lee has always been appreciated for his entire life. Well, we almost send his publisher to bankruptcy back then. DC were killing it, partly because of their more “mature” and “live-actionable” characters, particularly Batman. DC characters are conveniently set. Bruce Wayne is rich guy with some personality, principed enough to be predictable and not too involved in stupid things. Clark Kent has a more than comfortable career as a journalist. In the era before social media, people kept their personal miseries in their own padlocked diary books. Now, they all laid it bare to everyone in social media. We know that a journalist career is not as convenient as the one shown in Superman comics or cartoon. DC has all the popularity currency to give their silly superheroes their silly superpowers. But then there is Marvel with their edgy “realistic” characters that reminded us with real everyday nagging problems. I mean Peter Parker's stint in journalism under J. Jonah Jameson feels much more real, his everyday struggle with his life feels real too, his relationship with MJ, I can't stand it as a kid, seeking for a dependable adult role model. Then, the other popular Marvel franchise at the time is the X-Men. Another troubled group of people, unreasonably discriminated against. Charles Xavier is such a noble guy, but he was rarely rewarded with respect, eternal peace, or “live happily ever after” for his effort. That alone is disturbing fantasy. Magneto, who represented our justified rage kept being portrayed as the bad guy. You are also being made uncomfortable with the fact that you are the humans in that story. So, it is quite immersive and depressing at the same time. Marvel is too woke for me, I want to be like the three wise monkeys at this point towards real world problems. However, I don't deny, that all of these “woke”ness, are accompanied by intelligent writing, sensibility, depth, complexity, and immersion. The latest incarnation of “New Warriors” simply don't have all of this. The redflag is with the background story of this character: I mean fecking “internet gas”. Avengers were hardly popular back then, because of Pym Particle being a convenient plot device. He is also conveniently excluded from the original Avengers in MCU. But internet gas is certainly the new level of laziness. I get it that this character's main appeal is immersion. You can definitely relate to this meme-bingeing kid, but in the era of instant Google search facts and Wikipedia quick study (which is also part of this hero's ability), internet gas sounds utterly stupid. Good luck on relying on the internet as your primary source of super power, lest you turn into this: [LINKED_TEXT: Twitter taught Microsoft’s friendly AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day] [URL: https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist] OK, shallow background story, what's next? Oh, a Doraemon-esque superhero. Instead of magic pocket containing endless supplies of futuristic gadgetry, she has a magic backpack, which is less convenient for quick retrieval of items. I can see how this is being useful when you go against the likes of MCU Thanos or Dormamu, let alone Galactus. Anyway, her speciality stops at that other than being a blatant token representation of her identity: plus sized (quite a health risk there) and Native American ancestry. You got to wait to make her character more interesting. At least Kamala Khan, the Ms. Marvel is edgy, woke, and interesting at the same time. They never have to advertise her as our “Muslim” superhero. The name is simply “Ms. Marvel”. Her ability doesn't necessarily reflect her ethnicity or religious belief. But “Trailblazer” is basically nothing more than her identity. She is the “in your face” ethnicity tropes and stereotypes of a character. That is admittedly edgy, but intelligent it is not. It reeks laziness. I don't think that even in the future, this will age gracefully as the older Marvel franchise did, this is simply silly. At least Pet Avengers are fun and meme-able, this “New Warriors” is quite possibly offensive. It sounds like the author is trying to sarcastically celebrating these characters' identity, especially when you consider their names. I mean, like hippies, they started as an identity, but it didn't go on well as time passes, I think this whole “wokeness” would pass on as another silly social movement chapter in our history. While the older “woke” Marvel themes may become relevant these days, due to their serious take on the topics, the discussion that the character went through, it feels as if the authors went through something real in the real life. This new “woke” movement felt forced, like the author has no idea what it is like out there being marginalised and practically inexist from larger social conversation. The cartoonish take at social commentary, felt more like a joke than a serious discussion at best. We will move on towards better acceptance, while get rid of the extreme novelties. Throughout the time, Marvel has released a lot of failed comic series, I think this one is clearly destined to be one of them."},{"instruction":"’m moving with my cats from a very stressful home, & they use their cat trees for comfort now.

We had a policy to admit overnight and not ask too many questions. The mothers were desperate and had no help , they may of been scared of their partners violence or their own if they broke down when the baby would not stop crying . And some babies can cry a hell of a lot .It was a poor area and mothers were scared of social services simply because many of them had been bought up in care or in abuse that nobody stopped .They knew their baby was safe and well fed and warm in hospital . Unfortunately those admissions stopped because of lack of beds but l know it saved a few lives by just giving a mother 10 hours sleep and the realisation that there was help and understanding.

The best way to decide if taking the SAT, ACT, or both tests is right for you is to take a timed full-length practice test of each type. Since the content and style of the SAT and ACT are very similar, factors like how you handle time pressure and what types of questions you find most challenging can help you determine which test is a better fit. Most colleges require either the SAT or ACT and express no preference for either test. That said, significant percentages of students at selective colleges are submitting scores from both tests when they apply.

Once she talked normally her mamma answered her and all was fine. We’ve since kept doing that and she’s learning it’s best to express herself through words instead of whining so bad no one can really understand anyway. She’s 3 1/2 and has a massive vocabulary… when she was roughly 2 years old I gave her some fruit and she said “this is delicious!” Lol… she always comes up with huge words, with complete comprehension, making us laugh!

Web proxy is an intermediary between Web users and online resources. By directly accessing the website, you will submit a web request containing information about you (server or PC in use, your location, fingerprint of your browser, IP address, etc.). In response to the data sent, Web resources provide you with the content you requested. Unlike direct connections between users and websites, proxy-based connections provide a gateway for your web requests and the data you will receive from the website. The proxy server can hide or modify the data of your web request, and filter the content of the website to prevent it from obtaining unwanted information. This also guarantees you anonymous web browsing and data collection. How does it work? Every time you visit a website by clicking a link or manually entering a URL in a browser, you will create and send a web request, which will be forwarded to the proxy server. Then, the proxy server will modify and encrypt your data (such as Internet Protocol (IP) address) and send it to the web resource. After that, the website sends your data to the proxy server that processes the data, and then transmits the information from the website to you. In this way, it can be used as a firewall or web filter so that you only get the information you want to receive. Now that you have understood \`\`How do proxy servers work?

They also can’t be allowed near lightbulbs. If they get cold, they will set themselves on fire. They practice cannibalism on the weak. They eat their own feces, which they produce copiously. They are, however, tasty. Goats are like cats but more formidable. They have wildly varying personalities and are not particularly interested in changing for your comfort.

To be eligible for a domain transfer, you must work with your current domain registrar for at least 60 days, as ICANN operates a 60-day change of registrant lock. 1. Make sure your domain is eligible for transfer. According to ICANN regulations, if you created or transferred your domain name within the last 60 days, it is not eligible for transfer. Calculate before making the conversion to make sure you don't waste time. 2. Update your contact information. The registrar you are leaving and your new DNS registrar will need to contact you during the transfer. Therefore, your contact details must be up to date. 3. Configure your email sending domain. Your domain registrar usually provides email services related to your domain name. This allows you to send emails to and from addresses like [LINKED_TEXT: you@yoursite.com] [URL: mailto:you@yoursite.com] and can help you grow your business. When you forward to another registrar, these email accounts are often disabled, potentially disqualifying you. Make sure you have a backup email address ready to use before you begin the transfer process so you can receive important communications. 4. Unlock your domain name. Look for the \\"unlock domain\\" option in your domain registrar's control panel. Each provider is different, but you'll likely find them under the \\"Domain\\" or \\"Security\\" section of the main account screen. Domains are locked by default to prevent accidental modification or deletion. Depending on your current provider, you may be able to unlock your domain with a single click, or you may need to request a manual unlock directly from your domain registrar. 5. Request an authorization code. To transfer domains, you need an authorization code (also known as a Credential, Credential or Credential Token). This code protects your domain from being transferred by an unauthorized party. Additionally, this code acts as a bridge between your old registrar and your new provider and must be provided within five days of your request, usually via email. Some registrars allow automatic code generation directly from their control panel. 6. Create an account with your new registrar. Next, go to your new registrar and create an account. Find its transfer services page and enter the domain name you are transferring. \\"www\\" is not required - just enter your domain name and suffix (e.g. .com, .org, .info, etc.). 7. Enter the authorization code. Enter the authorization code provided by your old registrar. Check that you have entered the correct code as provided to you. If the code doesn't match, your transfer will fail and you may have to start over. 8. Domain name transfer authorization. Once you have entered the authorization code, both your old registrar and your new provider will contact you. You will be asked to confirm your details and formally approve the transfer. Make sure the contact information you provide to both registrars is accurate and be prepared to answer questions about why you're leaving your current service. 9. Pay for your domain name transfer. Now you will have to pay for your domain name transfer. Your new provider may ask you to pay for a year of service, but promotions that offer the first year free are common. 10. Complete the domain transfer. Once the domain is released by your original registrar, your new domain registrar will need time to set up your domain and servers. It usually takes a few days to a week. During this time, your website will still be accessible from your old registrar.

To be fair I'm sure my Grandson did have issues keeping his hands to himself. Not in a way where he would hit or hurt other kids but more in a touch feely your way to far in my bubble kind of way. He is an only child and at 9 finally about to get a sibling in 2 months. He is a very sweet little boy and loved other kids but didn't really have any to play with regularly until school started. The teacher told my husband not to worry he would get him trained. Like wtf he isn't a dog he Is a little boy. Some other stuff that was BS because I feel like putting those kids in those boxes was so hurtful. I feel like it made them outcasts. I understand if they were being disruptive maybe they did need some extra space but how about letting them start fresh every morning or every week? They got there boxes at the 2nd week of school and had them all year. We ended up having a meeting and making some changes we actually left the square issue alone because while I hated them I do understand my Grandson couldn't be in other kids personal space or touching them even if not hurting them if it's unwanted. We did go to school quite a few days and he acted better when we were there but it was also helpful to see how he was being treated as well."},{"instruction":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","output":"Here are favourite website to read book for free. 1 Zlibrary 2 pdfdrive"},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

No, wind turbines do not run on diesel. What you might be talking about is wind farms in general. A wind farm is like any power station: it has lots of machines which run on electricity. Lights, electronics, sensors, right down to the kettle in the staff room; they all run on electricity. Obviously they’re connected to the grid, so normally they just get power from that. When they’re generating that means they obviously power themselves, when they’re not they draw power from other generators. This is the same for any type of power station, and always has been. If a wind farm has any diesel generators on site they’ll be for emergency use when the grid goes down. If the grid fails all the turbines will have to stop generating because there’s nowhere to send the power. They’ll feather their blades a disconnect their generators. The whole thing shuts down, but you’ll still need to run things like warning lights on the turbines so that aircraft and ships don’t bump into them. Bringing power stations back online after a grid failure is called a black start and requires a certain amount of bootstrapping using backup devices such as gas turbines or diesel generators. But in ordinary operation, no wind turbines do not use diesel."},{"instruction":"Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Would-living-on-the-ceiling-of-a-mined-out-area-inside-a-fast-rotating-asteroid-be-more-feasible-than-fully-constructing-a-space-colony-station] Well . . . probably not.

But their history as always been of the ancient Britons, attached to Cornwall, which was annexed by England, that later became part of: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That’s your answer Mateus . They are BRITISH. Now, may I ask YOU Mateus, why does Brazil wants Trindade and Martim Vaz? [LINKED_TEXT: Trindade and Martim Vaz - WikipediaArchipelago in Brazil Trindade and Martim Vaz [3] ( Portuguese : Trindade e Martim Vaz , pronounced [tɾĩˈdadʒi i mɐʁˈtʃĩ ˈvas] ) is an archipelago located in the South Atlantic Ocean about 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) east off the coast of the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo , of which it forms a part. The archipelago has a total area of 10.4 square kilometres (4.0 square miles) and a navy-supported research station of up to 8 persons. [2] [4] The archipelago consists of five islands and several rocks and stacks ; Trindade is the largest island, with an area of 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 square miles); about 49 kilometres (30 miles) east of it are the tiny Martim Vaz islets , with a total area of 0.3 square kilometres (30.0 hectares ). The islands are of volcanic origin and have rugged terrain. They are largely barren, except for the southern part of Trindade. They were discovered in 1502 by Portuguese explorer Estêvão da Gama and stayed Portuguese until they became part of Brazil at its independence in 1822 . From 1895 to 1896, Trindade was occupied by the United Kingdom until an agreement with Brazil was reached. During the period of British occupation, Trindade was known as South Trinidad. The islands are situated some 2,100 kilometres (1,300 miles) southwest of Ascension Island and 2,550 kilometres (1,580 miles) west of Saint Helena , and the distance to the west coast of Africa is 4,270 kilometres (2,650 miles). Due the introduction of invasive species such as sheep, etc. the island's biodiversity has heavily deteriorated since the second half of the 20th century, with many indigenous species becoming endangered. [5] Geography [ edit ] The individual islands with their respective locations are given in the following: Ilha da Trindade (Portuguese for \\"Trinity Island\\") ( 20°31′30″S 29°19′30″W / 20.52500°S 29.32500°W / -20.52500; -29.32500 ) Ilhas de Martim Vaz ( 20°30′00″S 28°51′00″W / 20.50000°S 28.85000°W / -20.50000; -28.85000 ) Ilha do Norte (\\"North Island\\"), 300 metres (980 feet) north-northwest of Ilha da Racha, 75 metres (246 feet) high.

The shores are strewn with boulders. ( 20°30′18″S 29°20′42″W / 20.50500°S 29.34500°W / -20.50500; -29.34500 ) Rochedo da Agulha (\\"Needle Rock\\"), a flat circular rock 200 metres (660 feet) northwest of Ilha da Racha, is 60 metres (200 feet) high. Ilha do Sul (\\"South Island\\"), 1,600 metres (5,200 feet) south of Ilha da Racha, is a rocky pinnacle. Ilha do Sul is the easternmost point of Brazil.

MAGA bastions like Florida and Texas also do this. Which probably makes sense. You want to make sure you’re not putting grown-ups arrested for things like child pornography or sexual assault alone in a room full of kids. When the fingerprint search triggers a result, a Do Not Hire flag is added to prevent these criminals from simply going to another state and trying again. So, one possibility is that whoever started the rumor you cite simply got confused and conflated two different threats. Another possibility is that a different “problem code” was added to people who refused the vaccine, as it might be for other disciplinary issues. I did some research online and the only references to this issue I could find were from the Axis of Bullshit: Fox, Daily Caller, etc. That greatly raises the odds that the story isn’t true, at least as told. Even Rep. Jim Jordan, who usually throws caution — and facts — to the wind with his tweets was careful to use the word “reportedly” in posting about it, making me think he hasn’t seen any proof, either. In NYC Mayor Adams has announced that teachers fired for non-compliance are now free to reapply for their old jobs. So one thing that is certain — and we’ve known this for a while — is that refusing to protect the health of your co-workers was grounds for dismissal in many parts of the country. And THAT, not the twisted fingerprint story, should be what we’re talking about. Let’s end with… China. Where in the hell did you get that from? Just a generalized belief that all bad rumors come from Beijing?"},{"instruction":"f a submarine hit a seamount, in what ways could it be damaged that would require it to surface or return to shore?","output":"If hit with the bow first, it would damage or destroy the forward main ballast tank, and that would comprimise boyancy. They would attempt to stabilize the ship and drive it to periscope and start blowers to maintain boyancy. If that works, they'd likely stay submerged and head back. If the felt the damage was serious and that depth control was lost, they'd emergency blow and surface, then asses damage, and head back and call for help. Any other type of side impacct would likely damage systems to the point that the ship would be ineffective in its mission and would head back submerged. I don't know enough about excess boyancy, but if they have trouble maintaining depth because of an MBT failure or flooding, it might be time to attempt to get up to the surface via power or emergency blow and make a hasty exit for most of the crew. If you're deep enough to hit a seamount, you're literally within seconds of loosing the boat if you lose boyancy or power and the boat starts to settle.

Those, of course, need a feeder with the same impedance as the antenna.

Roman emperors had ruled from places like Milan nearer the frontiers for a long time. There was no reason for the capital to be at Rome itself, which was a long way from any threats. Also— Rome was regarded as a center of old ways and the old religions. Constantine as a new (albeit nominal) Christian, wanted to get away from that and have capital that could be both a Christian city and one without political baggage. Why would be change the name of the empire? Rome was a conservative society— tradition mattered. What would be the point in changing things?"},{"instruction":"What exactly is thermite?","output":"Original question: What is thermite? Thermite is a mixture of aluminum powder and iron powder. When the mixture is ignited, aluminum combines with oxygen in the air to form aluminum oxide, and liberates a lot of heat in the process. This heat melts the iron powder. So it is used in welding where welding rods are too small for the requirement. For example, joining two rails on a railway track by filling the gap between them using molten iron. The gap is filled with thermite and ignited.

Biodegradation: This is the process where microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae break down or degrade organic compounds into simpler, less toxic compounds. This method is commonly used to break down various types of waste, including municipal waste, industrial waste, and even specific components like plastics and hydrocarbons. By doing this, microbiology helps to reduce the amount of waste and pollution in the environment. The resulting products of biodegradation are usually water, carbon dioxide, and other simple compounds which are less harmful to the environment. 2. Bioremediation: Bioremediation is a process that uses microorganisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. It is often used to treat environmental issues like oil spills, heavy metal contamination, and pesticide pollution. There are two main types of bioremediation - in situ and ex situ. In situ bioremediation treats the contaminated ground in the location it is found, while ex situ involves removing the polluted soil or water to be treated elsewhere. Bioremediation is considered more environmentally friendly than other remediation techniques as it harnesses natural processes to restore the environment. These processes have several benefits including cost-effectiveness, reduction in the use of harmful chemicals, and the transformation of hazardous waste into non-toxic compounds. However, they require careful monitoring as conditions must be optimal for the microbes to carry out these processes effectively. For example, factors like temperature, pH, and the presence of necessary nutrients can all impact the effectiveness of biodegradation and bioremediation. In conclusion, microbiology offers promising, sustainable solutions to some of our most pressing environmental challenges. By harnessing the natural capabilities of microbes, we can mitigate pollution and contribute to environmental sustainability."},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

Imagine all the things that ever happened 10 years ago, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, million years ago, billion years ago. Imagine no matter how far back you go back there is always more past. Now imagine going in future, more advances in human technology, Sun dying, eventually universe dying, something else taking its place, but events keeps going on and on with no end in site. Now imagine this eternal existence is also infinitely large, or infinite number of limited universes(whatever lets you sleep soundly). Imagine all the infinite events going on at any time. Now imagine infinite events happening every instance, for all eternity. Already an eternity has passed with infinite events that happened, but infinite more events will happen in the infinite future. But still we have been seeing this like we are some fixed observer in space-time. Lets break that? Now since we are not an observer fixed in space-time. Imagine that all infinite events for all eternity happening simultaneously."},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter. Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"Based on the information provided, it sounds like you are being laid off or [LINKED_TEXT: terminated] [URL: https://lifestylechip.blogspot.com/] from your position rather than quitting voluntarily. However, your manager may be asking you to submit a resignation letter as a formality or to help protect the company's interests in some way. It is important to clarify with your manager the reason for the request for a resignation letter and to ensure that you fully understand the terms of your departure, such as any severance pay or benefits that you may be entitled to. You may also want to consult with an employment lawyer or HR representative to ensure that your rights are protected during this process."},{"instruction":"circular motion oscillatory?","output":"in general, circular motion is not oscillatory. Walk around a circular path and there is nothing oscillatory about your motion. But there is a sense in which uniform circular motion which repeats itself is oscillatory. Consider a bicycle wheel which you can freely rotate. Put a mark on the bicycle tire and start the wheel spinning at constant angular velocity. That mark repeatedly completes the circular path in the same amount of time for each rotation. That is, it’s motion is periodic. Now just consider the just vertical position of that mark (or just the horizontal position of that mark). That is what Yubal Masalker meant when he referred to the projections of the motion. If the wheel is rotating at a uniform rate, that vertical position of the mark on the tire can be described by a sine or cosine function with respect to time. That is, the vertical component of the position of that part of the tire is a sinusoidal function of time - and hence is oscillatory."},{"instruction":"w long does it take to travel from one end of France to the other by car?","output":"About 13 hours with comfort stops and meals. This year we went from Normandy to the Alpes haut Provence in three days.

It was an attractive, silver, Australian 8 sided, 50 cent piece with a 3 inch, doozy of a thick sharp nail welded right to the centre of one of its faces! He, in turn, had found it in the street. I can only imagine that it was deliberately made to spike tyres with so they would go flat. Otherwise, the mind boggles!"},{"instruction":"What is cosmetic dentistry and how is it different from general dentistry?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Cosmetic dentistry] [URL: http://cochindentalinstitute.com/what-is-cosmetic-dentistry/] is a subspecialty of dentistry that aims to make a patient's teeth, gums, and bite seem better. It includes a variety of dental procedures that can be used to enhance the aesthetics of the smile, such as teeth whitening, porcelain veneers, dental implants, and orthodontic treatments like braces or clear aligners. General dentistry, on the other hand, is focused on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral health conditions such as cavities, gum disease, and tooth decay. General dentists typically provide routine dental care, including cleanings, fillings, and extractions, as well as educating patients on how to maintain good oral hygiene. While both cosmetic dentistry and general dentistry can improve the health and appearance of a patient's smile, the primary focus of cosmetic dentistry is on enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the teeth and gums, while the primary focus of general dentistry is on maintaining and improving the overall health of the mouth. It's important to note that some cosmetic dental procedures, such as porcelain veneers or dental implants, can also have functional benefits in addition to improving the appearance of the teeth."},{"instruction":"coaching really necessary for the NEET preparation? Can I join coaching in 12th standard? Wouldn't it be tough for me?","output":"Coaching is not compulsory but recommended for students aspiring for competitive exams as coaching platforms have experienced faculties who can guide aspirants through the process of getting prepared for the exam. Self-study is sufficient for students who are well versed with the course, their pattern, etc. They can cover the concepts and syllabus from textbooks and practice with PYQs. Which is quite enough for them. However, for students who find it difficult to cover topics without the help of a mentor should go for a course provided by coaching platforms and follow it. But you should also keep in mind that the mentors are there to guide you, not do the work for you. You are responsible for your own Success or Failure. Don’t blame others later for your failure. Also, you can study simultaneously for your boards as well as for NEET. While studying for your boards, you are covering the basic fundamentals for your NEET. Without clearing your basics, you will find it difficult to cover the syllabus of NEET. So make sure your base is strong and you are good to go. You just need the right determination and motivation. Study hard and don’t lose focus. Maintain a schedule to manage your time better and keep up with it. If you need guidance from an experienced faculty, check out Misostudy. They have great courses for NEET/JEE/CBSE and their faculty members are quite experienced. You can check out their YouTube channel. They have tons of video lectures. Go through them and If you find their lectures helpful, you can head over to their website and check out the course details. You can also download PYQs and solutions from their website for free. All The Best!"},{"instruction":"Movies, Bowling, Axe Throwing & More | Cinergy Entertainme","output":"Oh there’s lots of reasons. Beginning at the inception of the Colonies until adding Alaska as a state, the US has always had a frontier. That’s centuries of having a frontier. To hunt, to defend themselves, to enforce peace, guns were needed. There was NO other substitute, no way around it. To this day, there are lots of areas of the nation where you bag a deer to help you get thru the winter. There are areas of the nation where bears and pumas are a concern. Adequate police protection is a rather recent thing. Again, for a few centuries, you needed guns to defend yourself and your family from thieves and other marauders. The law was a couple of hours ride away. Even in cities, vast neighborhoods were lawless no man’s lands. And there’s still folks who live out on farms or up in the mountains or in unincorporated/undeveloped areas that don’t live close to law enforcement. For centuries, the Colonies and later the US did not have a standing army. Kinda stupid considering everyone else had one. The US relied on the “citizen soldier”. The frontiersman, the mountain man, the farmer, the store clerk. Having a gun and knowing how to shoot made you valuable to the nation’s defense. In times of need, states would form their own battalions as part of a national effort. This really wouldn’t change until World War Two. A lot of Americans pre-Civil War considered themselves citizens of their state, not the nation. As a result they were suspicious of anything that sounded like Federal authority usurping state rights. This obviously boiled to a head in the Civil War. It’s outcome left a bad taste in some people’s mouths. So to this day, they’re still suspicious and are afraid their discontent will result in their rights being abridged. This is especially true for them in regards to the Second Amendment. They’ve seen all the guns in Australia rounded up. They’re aware of the rather draconian gun law in Europe. This doesn’t help the paranoid feelings. It culminates in right wingers thinking Hilary’s gonna put ’em all in FEMA death camps and left wingers thinking Trump’s gonna throw all non-whites into the gas chambers. They grip their guns a little tighter (Spoiler alert! Democrats own guns too!) Meanwhile, gun manufacturers make a LOT of money, and pay a LOT of taxes, and pay off a LOT of politicians. The NRA has a LOT of members that think someone's gonna take away their guns. They pay a LOT of dues. This hires a LOT of lobbyists to influence a LOT of politicians. So, you see, in the US, a lot of folks have real reasons for having and using them. Gun control? Forget about it. Assault weapons are a myth. the AR-15, while being a civilian version of the military’s M-16, is not an automatic weapon, it’s only .223 caliber, which is LOTS less powerful than you’re average semi-auto hunting rifle. It just looks mean. Background checks are good, but background checks in regards to terrorism have missed people and put the wrong people on no fly lists. You could ban mentally ill folks from buying a gun, but most of them are undiagnosed. You cant let race, religion, or political persuasion be a factor in denying gun ownership. See, not proud to say this, but our success is in spite of our selves. We came to be as immigrants on a wild and hostile continent. Human nature had us fighting each other and ourselves. The colonies should have failed. The Revolution should have failed. The Civil War should have finished us. But it didn’t. Everything we are, from our proudest achievements to our foulest sins, grew out of that fighting mindset we were thrust in to. It is the same story as anywhere else on Earth, but here it happened in a few hundred years, not the thousands of Europe or the tens of thousands of Asia. Despite everything, we’ll hold onto our guns a little longer. Shootings and violent crime are actually down in the US, just the incidents of loud mass shootings are up. The 24 hour news networks don’t bring that fact up because they’re in the business of selling fear and division. Which sells more guns."},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"There are many ways to make money online without an investment in 2023.

AIIMS Delhi- Just coz it looks good on top of list😂 2. MAMC- The college I am aiming for though not sure whether I would get it.(Pray for me plz) 3. VMMC- Initially there was a confusion between VMMC and MAMC. Considering one has a better hostel while the other a better campus, with VMMC’s pg quota being better than MAMC’s, the decision was tough. But ultimately I decided that MAMC>VMMC. 4. ABVIMS&RML hosptial, New Delhi- The same IPU quota like VMMC with repuation rising at a phenomenal rate, it is also a great college. 5. AIIMS Jodhpur- Arguably the second best AIIMS with helpful seniors and great campus. 6. KGMC Lucknow- It comes so low in the list because of the service bond😥, otherwise one of the best colleges out there. 7. Seth GS Medical college- At the end of the list, once again, due to service bond of maharashtra. Now, If someone is thinking about why I have not included IMS BHU or JIPMER in the list, I have my reasons.

You might read people saying “i found purpose”, but the irony is life itself has no purpose. Life is just an event that happening in the cosmos, in an infinite number of manifestations. The same life energy which is absolute, has identified itself into multiple lives in multiple forms. In effect, the life force that exists within you, me and all the living beings are the one and the same. this life force is the only true immortal thing that exists. This life force has manifested itself into infinite lives, with different degrees of limitation. Now why it has limited itself into many forms of different capabilities? It is probably because, without this limitation there is no event or drama that can happen in life. For life to exist, drama needs to unfold. So in effect, life has constituted a design by which it can make itself take multiple forms and forget its true form. so each living being and non living being, is a manifestation of same life force. This is the way life happens. if your question is about finding what interests you in life, then the answer is within you. You as a person are directed by your own desires and intuition. follow your heart and be brave enough to not follow the crowd. you will find your direction in life."},{"instruction":"want to use C++ to learn Machine Learning instead of Python or R, is it fine?","output":"If you're interested in learning machine learning but prefer to use C++ instead of Python or R, you might be wondering whether this is a good idea. After all, Python and R are the two most popular programming languages for machine learning, and there are many resources and libraries available for these languages. However, there are several reasons why C++ can be a great choice for learning machine learning, and in this article, we'll explore some of these reasons and provide you with tips on how to get started. Firstly, C++ is a high-performance programming language that is often used for developing fast and efficient software. This is because C++ allows for low-level access to hardware, which can be useful when working with large datasets or when developing computationally-intensive algorithms.In fact, many popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch are written in C++. Secondly, if you already have experience with C++, you may find it easier to learn machine learning in this language. This is because you are already familiar with the syntax and structure of the language, which can help you focus on learning the machine learning concepts and techniques, rather than learning a new programming language at the same time.Additionally, many machine learning algorithms can be easily implemented in C++, which can help you develop a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work. Thirdly, C++ can be a good choice for developing applications that require real-time processing, such as autonomous vehicles or robotics. In these applications, speed and efficiency are critical, and C++ can be a better choice than Python or R for achieving this. So, if you've decided to learn machine learning with C++, where should you start? Here are some tips to help you get started: Learn the basics of C++:If you're new to C++, start by learning the basics of the language, such as data types, loops, and functions.There are many resources available online, including tutorials and video courses, that can help you get started. Learn the fundamentals of machine learning:Before you can start implementing machine learning algorithms in C++, you need to understand the fundamentals of machine learning.This includes topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.Again, there are many resources available online to help you learn these concepts. Choose a machine learning library:Once you have a good understanding of the basics of C++ and machine learning, you can choose a machine learning library to work with.Some popular machine learning libraries for C++ include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.These libraries provide a wide range of tools and functions for developing machine learning applications, and there are many resources available online to help you learn how to use them. Implement machine learning algorithms:With a good understanding of C++ and machine learning, and a chosen machine learning library, you can start implementing machine learning algorithms.Start with simple algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression, and gradually work your way up to more complex algorithms like deep neural networks.As you work on implementing these algorithms, you will develop a deeper understanding of how they work and how they can be optimized for performance. Practice and experiment:As with any new skill, practice is essential for mastering machine learning with C++.Experiment with different algorithms, parameters, and data sets to see how they affect performance.This will help you develop a deeper understanding of how machine learning works and how to apply it to real-world problems. In conclusion, while Python and R are the most popular programming languages for machine learning, C++ can be a great choice for learning machine learning, especially if you already have experience with the language. C++ is a high-performance language that allows for low-level access to hardware, making it a great choice for computationally-intensive applications. That's all from my side, Thanks for scrolling!

Androids are supposed to look like humans. Robots don’t have to. But there’s another big difference. Androids are way more autonomous. Robots are generally designed for a purpose where they will do complex or repetitive tasks based on their programming. The root word for Robot after all is “robota” which meant “forced labor”, either by a slave or an indentured servant. So: “Robocop” would be “Slave Cop”…. Androids typically have a designed function but they’re more autonomous. They make decisions for themselves and have “off time” pursuits. Look at C3POs adventures. They have a general assignment but go about making decisions in their own way. Also look at David, Bishop, or Ash on the Alien series. Again, general assignments… but with enough programming to be able to make decisions and do things not directly related to a particular assignment. So a “Droid” on Star Wars is neither purely a humanoid android nor a mindless slave robot. It’s somewhere in the middle. A robot with a mind of its own."},{"instruction":"What are the pros/cons of using alcohol vs. marijuana?","output":"i wouldnt use any of them"},{"instruction":"w do I translate Hindi sentences in Sanskrit?","output":"If the work you’re taking on is regularly based on Sanskrit, then, I would suggest you to learn Sanskrit, as it will help you in the long run because even Google translator doesn’t translate Hindi sentences into Sanskrit.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Some are, some are not. The question should be “Is the average education level of students who go to private schools better than the average education level of students who go to public schools?” To that I would say almost assuredly. This is not because the average curriculum and teaching ability at private schools is better. Yes, private schools usually have a smaller classroom size. This helps but the major reason is because the average family that has children attend private schools places a higher value on education. The family encourages the child to study. This is no different than a family that encourages their child to be best at sports such as baseball and football, in performance arts such as singing and instrumental music, or any other endeavor. If the child is having problems that family either helps directly or gets a specialist such as a gymnastics instructor, vocal coach, or a tutor. The child values the field and tries harder. A teacher can only do so much. Contrary to popular belief, the job of teachers is not to TEACH, it is to assist students in learning. In elementary/primary school this is mainly through repetition. They provide a lecture, which is usually short and then practice, practice, practice. The practice is no better than can be achieved through purchasing the workbooks or many programs such as provided by Highlights magazine. The difference is the mostly the analysis and correction of the students during the practice. Analysis of thought process when solving problems is why teachers for homework require students to show their work. It is not because they WANT to analyze every step. It is because they NEED to analyze each step to ensure the students know and understand what they are doing. One of the reasons I do not consider class size as important when comparing public schools and private schools is though depending on the state the the average public class size can be over 50 students per teacher in ELEMENTARY/PRIMARY school (hopefully just a class like physical education), though the vast majority are between 25–30 students per class. There are a few states such as Maine, Wyoming, and Tennessee where the average public school elementary class size is around 17 or slightly smaller than the average classroom size of a most private schools except in the area of special education."},{"instruction":"w do I buy a stock after the markets close on Upstox and Zerodha?","output":"Thanks for A2A Neetish , Basically Buying or selling of a Stock after the market closes is reffered as After Market Order (AMO). Both the brokers Zerodha and Upstox provide this facility to thier customers , and the process of placing a AMO order is quite similar through all the brokers . AMO orders can be placed only during the following time duration – Equity - 3:45 PM to 8:57 AM for NSE and 3:45 PM to 8:59 AM for BSE Currency - 3:45 PM to 8:59 AM F&O – 3:45 PM to 9:10 AM MCX – Anytime during the day, if placed during the market hours the order will go through the next day at 9 AM To place an AMO , click on the Buy(B) or Sell(S) for the scrip, click on “More options” at the bottom of the order window and select “AMO”. You can look at the image below to understand better : Note: 1. You will not be able to place stoploss orders using AMOs. The AMOs will be sent to the exchange at the following times - - Equity [NSE & BSE] - Market and Limit orders - 9 AM - Equity [NSE & BSE] - IOC validity, or Disclosed Quantity (less than 100% of sell quantity) - 9:15 AM - F&O - 9:15 AM - CDS - 9:00 AM 2.

Weren’t they supposed to be taken down after the war?","output":"They were supposed to be taken down, but the Reconstruction of the South turned out to be harder than the Federal troops believed it should be. After the war, it was like the South had conceded, the physical fight, and began an psychological one instead. Their Southern pride took over, and they revered the men who stood up to protect “their way of life”. These statues were a reminder that they never really gave up, and in essence planned to rise again. Understand, many of these statues weren’t really erected until years after the war was over. Just like the flags of many Southern states, didn’t incorporate the “confederate” flag until the middle of the 20th Century. This was done to remind the Black citizens there that they were “subjects” and under the rule of the sons and daughters of the confederacy. This is when when the Jim Crow centennial began. Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' \\"These statues were meant to create legitimate garb for white supremacy,\\" James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, says that the increase in statues and monuments was clearly meant to send a message. Grossman said. \\"Why would you put a statue of Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson in 1948 in Baltimore?\\" I wished that federal government would have stepped in a long time before these statues, and those local laws were cemented. I wished that generations of Black people didn’t have to experience the pain of seeing their sons and daughters beaten and lynched on trees by the thousands.

Listening is crucial. As a non-native speaker, you will doubtlessly have learned grammar rules but native speakers break these rules frequently (often without even knowing they are doing so). The only way a non-native can learn this is to immerse themselves in English as much as possible and begin to identify when it is OK (and equally when it isn’t OK) to break grammar rules.That leads nicely into my second point. Go and live in a native-speaking country. Teachers can help you improve your pronunciation of English but to pick up an English (or American) accent, you really need to be around it every day.Get comfortable with idioms and slang. One of the worst things for a native speaker is talking to a non-native speaker who sounds like they are reading from a textbook. Native speakers will relax much more easily around a non-native speaker if that person uses everyday expressions. However, some of these expressions that you might learn from a book are now very dated. For example, no one says “it’s raining cats and dogs” any more. We are much more likely to say “it’s pissing down” which you would only learn from a native speaker and not from a book.Watch comedy. I mentioned above about how important listening is and in my opinion, for those wanting to sound like a native, comedy is the best type of show you can watch. Not only does comedy give you an insight into the culture of a place but it has two other big advantages. Firstly, a lot of jokes are funny because they are based on double-meanings and therefore you will learn alternate meanings of the same word or phrase. Secondly, comedy programmes are strewn with regional accents and therefore your listening and your knowledge of regional slang will improve. Finally, there is an element of luck in terms of how fast you can pick up an accent. Some people have a musical ear and therefore can mimic accents very easily. These people can often be mistaken for native speakers even if they only speak at a passable level. However, if you are not such a person, patience is the most important thing - you will need to put in a lot of work to sound like a native speaker.

May be this was the same floods that initially inundated mythical cities like Dwaraka, Atlantis etc and later over next few millennia, obliterated all traces of earlier civilisation? According to Indian scriptures called Matsya Purana, our ancestors used to live towards far South and escaped from great floods or Pralay, and settled later in the northwest parts...Could it be possible that the survivors of this event migrated to settlements at Indus valley, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Europe, introducing Sanskrit in the process?

We don't have relatives in Canada.","output":"Whether you know someone or have relatives in Canada makes no difference. Getting jobs in Canada not likely to be possible unless both you and your brother have high level, unusual, or rare skills that cannot already be found among Canadians or Permanent Residents. Unlike some countries, Canada does not have a work permit that allows foreign nationals to come to Canada and search for a job. In order to get work permits, you must both already have valid, LMIA-approved job offers from a Canadian employer. LMIA-approved means that the employer has completed a lengthy and expensive process required to prove to a Canadian government agency that no one in Canada can fill an available job. Only then can the employer offer a job to someone outside Canada. Because Canada has a well-educated workforce and many people are now unemployed due to COVID-19, it would be very unusual for an employer not to find people in Canada to fill almost any available job. That is why I suggest the only way you’d get work permits would be if you both had unusual/rare/unique skills. You can certainly try to find jobs in Canada. If you are expert application programmers or skilled tradespeople, that might be possible. But for every other field, it is very unlikely that a Canadian employer would hire foreign workers, especially now. Many companies have their recruiting software set to screen out foreign applicants.

Berry had been sentenced to prison for robbing a bank in 1961, and he spent three years there. However, he successfully appealed this conviction, citing the disparaging comments of the judge as the basis for his conviction. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, [LINKED_TEXT: Chuck Berry] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] discussed his musical influences. In one instance, he mentioned Les Paul as an influence on his playing. The guitarist even said that the song \\"How High the Moon\\" by Les Paul inspired him. In another interview, he said that \\"It was very beautiful.\\" In response to a question about the influence of Mick Jagger on Berry, he scoffed. The music business was still very different in the 1950s than it is today, and racial prejudice was a major obstacle to Chuck Berry's success. His publicity photos were deliberately underexposed in order to make his skin tone appear lighter, a tactic that often backfired. For example, a Knoxville club booked him, thinking that he was white. He was then turned away. While Chuck Berry certainly knew that Presley was a trailblazer, he felt that achievability on the scale of Presley's was his to claim. In fact, in 1958, he ranked eight songs on the Hot 100, his most successful year. Chuck Berry was a prolific songwriter and guitarist. He took his country and blues influences and turned them into a new sound. He also influenced others with his lyrics, which were a mixture of subtle critique and wit. As a result, he helped pave the way for Bob Dylan. But in terms of style and music, he and Presley were very different. Chuck Berry was a fan of Nat King Cole, and he played blues songs by Muddy Waters and Jay McShann. In fact, he sang the famous \\"Confessin' the Blues\\" at school, which was considered inappropriate for a school event. While this might have seemed like an odd choice at the time, it was a big hit, and his popularity skyrocketed. In the '50s, Chuck Berry was a recognizable stage presence and an icon. Chuck Berry was considered one of the founders of [LINKED_TEXT: rock] [URL: https://youtu.be/EmO3NXnjf2Y] and roll. His style and talent helped bring the genre into the mainstream, and many people wanted to emulate him. In fact, John Lennon said that Chuck Berry's name stands for rock and roll, and his music paved the way for the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and David Bowie, AC/DC, and so many more. Presley's music career began in the 1950s. He signed a recording contract with Sun Studios and made several hit singles. After the recording contract, Sam Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA for 35,000, and Elvis was a big star.

Whatever vile things the pagans of old did - human sacrifices, religious persecutions, sacred wars, slavery, oppression, etc. - Christians also did, often with no less gleeful zeal. Whatever was good in pre-Christian religions - from highbrow philosophical and mystical traditions, to the simple practices of communal charity and natural spirituality - found its way into Christianity as well. The idea that the Church has moral high ground over religions which preceded it, lead to the development of new and nastier kind of antisemitism, hitherto unknown to pagan world, which found its ultimate fulfillment in gas-chambers and body-pits of Holocaust. Above: typical medieval depiction of triumphant and morally upright Church (left) vs. blind and humiliated Synagogue (right). And while Nazism definitely was not a Christian movement - indeed, it consciously emulated many of the worst aspects of old pagan religions - it is quite damning that Nazis could and did use writings of the ancient Church fathers and Christian priests, to justify their atrocities against the very people from which Christianity sprouted. And it doesn't help that a considerable number of Christians, to say the least, didn't exactly break their balls to stop them; the leadership of Catholic Church, for instance, which through history was quite trigger-happy about proclamations of holy wars, decided to remain tactfully discreet through that war - while the freaking communists, out of all the people, bleed themselves white in fighting the Nazi nightmare! Examples such as this (and I could list many more, but Godwin’s law does the trick) after almost two milenia of Christianity, really ought to melt most claims of its moral superiority into thin air of humility. Which is, of course, the finer point of Christianity. It was not a religion which claimed a moral superiority of its unique message. It was a religion which called for re-inclusion of morally questionable back into society: of outcasts, deplorables and downtrodden. Its founder famously proclaimed that He did not come to the righteous, but to the sinners, for “it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.” (Mark 2:17) Its earliest adherents were whores, tax collectors, infidels, lepers, criminals and soldiers of an occupying imperial army, while its detractors were priests, men of letters, pious patriots, wealthy merchants, respectable landowners and governing officials concerned solely with maintaining law and order. Its most basic wisdom constantly emphasized how everyone deserves a second chance, no matter their transgressions, how one should first “remove the beam from his eye before plucking a speck from his brother’s eye” (Matthew 7:5), and how one should not judge others, but like God, love both the just and the sinner, for “He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Matthew 5:45) And its most famous symbol is the crucifix: a device of tortuous execution, onto which - according to the fundamental Christian myth - we humans condemned God to die, because He failed to meet our high moral standards. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

It was class 9 when I met my crush, being from an average high school it was quite obvious that there would be a menace while going into the washroom (no, I did not meet her there ofcourse). She was from our senior batch and was going to appear for the ICSE boards that year and she was one heck of a student, without a doubt she was treated as an elite among her batch (this isn't a sapiosexual case either). While coming back from the washroom we almost collided but thanks to her friends that did not happen. And that's pretty much how I met with her. Soon after that I formed my research team who had the sole purpose to track down her every detail. About 3 days after I got to know her name, probable place of living and her marks(which was fu**** good!!). Then it took about 3weeks for an opportunity to spark up for me to talk with her. I was a class monitor back then and I had to call one of my teachers to attend the class luckily her class was just beside the staffroom. She was inside the staffroom (and God! I thanked him like a hundred times) probably waiting for the incharge to show up and after a moment of silence…. Her: Kon class tor? (Which class are you from?) Me: 9 B (shocked, utterly shocked plus stammering) A moment of silence again and then the incharge showed up and I went back to my class after informing. That was the 1st time I talked with her. 2years later 2 years later I found her out on Facebook. Texted her after the request was accepted and then got to know about the advancements she made in her career (something about 98% in ISC) and she was damn frank. So I asked her about some tips to score better and then something gooooooood happened. She said I can take her notes if I wanted since the subject combination was same in my higher secondary(thank you God, once again!) She asked for my number jumping with a happy soul I sent it to her and it was around 2:15am and she called me right away although I was not supposed to receive that. So after a day we met, unofficially for the 1st time and in totality, 2nd time. Moments later I was on her scooty's backseat. (Sources from Google) Now, those who thought that I had accomplished the unaccomplishable stuff, let me clarify it. I was on her backseat, with her note books on the way to photocopy them. That was perhaps one of the best moment I ever had till date. Thanks for giving it a go! Edit 1: It has almost reached 900, so I thought of making it a bit lucrative XD.

What is it made up of? Will we be able to create it?","output":"What is dark matter? — We don’t know. What is it made up of? — We don’t know. Will we be able to create it? — We don’t know. Frustrating, isn’t it. So what do we know, then? Why do we even speak of “dark matter”? Because, to put it bluntly, our theory of gravity fails over very large distance scales. Galaxies spin too quickly yet do not fly apart. Galaxies move in clusters way too fast, yet the clusters remain intact. And cosmology tells us that the cosmos should have roughly seven times more nonrelativistic matter than what we observe. So then, the hypothesis goes, what if there is, actually, more matter and we just don’t see it? What if 80-odd percent of all matter is in a form that simply does not interact with known forms of matter, hence it is “dark”? (More accurately, it should be called transparent matter. It’s not really “dark”: it does not absorb light, does not cast a shadow. It behaves as though it simply wasn’t there. Transparent.) If we postulate this dark matter component, all is well. Galaxies spin the way they’re supposed to with dark matter halos surrounding them. Clusters of galaxies stay intact because of the extra gravity of dark matter holding them together. And cosmology works, too, kind of (although it requires another mystery component, dark energy). So these are strong reasons to believe that dark matter exists. But we would, of course, like to be able to confirm it through direct detection and, well, figure out what it is made of! So far, we failed. There are many theoretical proposals to explain dark matter. These have either been falsified (i.e., they predicted a way to detect dark matter which then did not pan out in experiments) or have not yet been tested (mainly because of the difficulty of devising an experiment to detect something that rarely, or never, interacts with the stuff that we are made of). For this reason, there are alternative proposals as well, such as theories of modified gravity, which attempt to do away with the dark matter concept altogether, proposing instead novel changes to Einstein’s theory of gravity. But that, too, is a very difficult path: Einstein’s theory is notoriously hard to modify without destroying its “nice” features, and then there is the question of testing a theory through observation."},{"instruction":"Why does it appear Captain America's Vibranium shield seems almost indestructible, but in ‘Black Panther’ the Vibranium armored cars are easily destroyed?

In fact, it is theorized that a GRB is the most energy-producing phenomenon in the known universe. So in theory Superman would get much more power with a GRB than with a Quasar. A Gamma Ray Burst is when a massive star goes hypernova and two jets of ultra-concentrated stellar energy are generated. Just to give you a little idea, a Gamma Ray Burst can generate the Sun's energy a Million Trillion times in less than a second. If Superman is directly exposed to the blast of energy fired from a GRB it is as if Superman obtained the total energy of a Million Trillion Suns in less than a second, just imagine that Ultra Sundipping.

That is because the basis of Carnatic music is very different. Carnatic musicians believe in upholding the sanctity and purity of the compositions that the great saints like Thyagaraja created. So generation after generation, musicians have to a T, maintained the exact same way in which a composition has been rendered, without changing so much as a single note or glide. Hindustani in the other hand, encourages the modification and embellishment of compositions, by adding the musical expressions and interpretations of the individual artiste. While the basic underlying melodic structure of a composition might be the same, every artist is allowed to sing it differently. Musicians from certain parts of the country who were learning from each other eventually created the system of gharanas. This meant different singing styles, different fingering (for the instrumentalists) and so on.

I’m not saying “If Koufax, then Santana” (although I think Santana deserved more consideration than he got), but I am saying that over 85% of the voters treated Koufax as the special case he was, and the rest may well have said “Sure he was brilliant for four years, but is that enough?”"},{"instruction":"w would you rank all of the MCU film villains, including Mysterio?","output":"There is a saying “a hero is only as good as their villains”. The only problem MCU had was their villains, which now they have improved considerably. I haven't watched Spiderman: Far from Home yet, so haven't included Mysterio in the list. I will update as soon as I watch it. I will go from worst to best. 21. Malekith (Thor: The Dark World) The extremely powerful dark-elf who was as bland as they come. There was no real motivation behind the character development and he was the reason why Thor 2 was so bad. 20. Ghost (Ant-Man and the Wasp) Ghost who? Yeah, that's how forgettable she was. She certainly had potential but she barely felt like a villain. 19. Whiplash (Iron Man 2) The one who always had a toothpick tucked in his mouth. Yeah, that's how I remember him. Only good thing about his character was his motivation to make the world see that Iron Man can be vulnerable. 18. Mandarin (Iron Man 3) When you find the fake Mandarin in the movie to be more interesting than the real Mandarin, then you know there is something wrong with the characters. That plot-twist was really unnecessary. 17. Yellowjacket (Ant-Man) The bad guy who stole the technology of his former partner to create a suit that has all this cool abilities. Oh wait! Isn't this was the story arc for the villain in first Iron Man movie? Yeah, that's why I put Yellowjacket so low in the list. 16. Yon-Rogg (Captain Marvel) Oh he is not Mar-vel. Oh wow he was manipulating Carol Denver's this whole time? They really wasted him what seemed like a manipulating boyfriend of Captain Marvel. He really has a potential to be a badass villain. 15. Abomination (The Incredible Hulk) Oh look isn't he looks like Doomsday? No stupid, he just has a severe case of psoriasis. In his defence, he could have destroyed hulk only if hulk didn't got adrenaline rush after seeing his lady love. 14. Dormammu (Doctor Strange) If you consider yourself the ruler of dark dimension who knows in-and-out of magic and yet you got easily trapped in the infinite time loop by a sorcerer, you are not worthy to be among the top villains. 13. Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger (Iron Man) He sets the tone for the MCU villains and was the main element behind why Tony Stark became the Iron Man. Thanks for that Iron Monger. 12. Kaecilius (Doctor Strange) Villainy eye-makeup sorcerer who went rogue. He was the disciple of Dormammu who has some amazing and trippy fight scenes with Doctor Strange. 11. Ronan the Accuser (Guardians of the Galaxy) He was the purple makeup zealot whose main purpose was to destroy the Xandar using the power stone. He has the guts to stuck it up to the Thanos and walk away from him. He sure has my respect. 10. Ego, the planet (Guardians of the Galaxy 2) He was literally a God and one of the most powerful beings in Marvel. Funnily enough like the name, he has an ego problem who treats every other beings apart from the celestial beings as a resource to consume in the quest for power. 9. Helmut Zemo (Civil War) He was an average guy who wanted a revenge for the death of his family. In my opinion he is an underrated villain whose name many doesn't even know but here he sits in the top 10 of my list. He strategically plans his moves. And what better way to take revenge than to turn the Avengers against each other. 8. Vulture (Spiderman: Homecoming) The guy who takes girlfriend's angry dad to whole new level. Basically he was a street level villain who believes that technological advancements has affected his career. In his armour he looks villainous and his motive makes him a good villain. 7. Red Skull (Captain America 1) One of the most terrifying looking villain who seems like the one who had an awful experience with plastic surgery. One good thing is that he don't have to deal with nose itching. On serious note, he headed or may I say started the Hydra division. He was the only villain apart from Thanos and Loki whose story arc deals with more than one infinity stones. 6. Ultron (Avengers: Age if Ultron) He portrays how can technology and superheros can be the reason of our doom. He has the real motivation behind his apocalyptic visions (unlike many villains in this list). If only he planned his attacks properly. 5. Winter Soldier (Captain America: Winter Soldier) Yeah I know he became superhero. But he started out as manipulated Villain. His history with the Captain America makes him a perfect villain in Captain America 2. He was the centre of attention of two Captain America movies and his bridge fight scene with Captain America and Black Widow was a treat to watch. 4. Hela (Thor: Ragnarok) Oh! I love her. The most comic accurate villain alongside Thanos and Loki. The goddess of death was the perfect supervillain for Thor where the family drama works better than anywhere else. She started out easily much stronger than Thor when she breaks Mjolnir without much sweat. Cate Blanchett casts perfectly as Hela. I don't know whether I have crush on her or on Hela. Maybe both. 3. Killmonger (Black Panther) Perfect villain for the Black Panther who was the cousin of black panther. He indeed has a superhero origin instead of villain origin where his father was killed by the then Black Panther and he was denied his royal heritage. If you are rooting more for the villain than the hero, then you know how good that villain is. 2. Loki ( So many many movies, not that I'm complaining) God of mischief is fan favourite. Eventhough he became good guy but he started out as a perfect villain who wreaked havoc on so many places. Everything about him is perfect- his backstory, his motivation, tricks up his sleeves, his wit and whatnot. Tom Hiddleston was so good that Marvel kept on bringing him even after so many deaths. Let's hope they bring him back once again. As hulk would say “Puny God”. 1. Thanos (Infinity War/ Endgame) The ultimate baddie of MCU. His character development spans over 9 years right from the first Avengers movie. He is the hero of his own story who thinks killing half of the universe is the only way to save the universe. For that he can go to any extent like sacrificing her own daughter in order to achieve that. That's what makes him a perfect villain. Fun Fact: In comics he wanted to destroy half of the universe as a tribute to Mistress of Death in hopes of gaining her favor.

How true is this?","output":"Did he really say this? If so, then he is even more dumb than we all assumed. If the elites want “no more families and children”, then how are they going to staff their businesses and factories, when the current generation dies out? Who is going to buy their products and services? If women are spending their money on “trivial things”, then that clearly doesn’t include the single parents who are buying food and clothing for their children, paying rent and taxes. If he means “trivial things” such as skin care and make up, then I guess he must prefer women who go around with dry skin and bare faced. Hmm - actually it doesn't seem that way when we look at the kind of women he likes to associate with. And healthy skin care is a lot less trivial than his enormous ego-boosting, gas guzzling cars he wastes money on.

The line is annoying, but quite representative of a teenager unaware of his primary emotions. It reminds me of how annoyed I was with Harry Potter in the 5th book of the series. Harry has a full-blown tantrum directed at Dumbledore. It’s not pretty, it’s not rational, it’s embarrassing, but it’s realistic. We’re dealing with a teen going through a very difficult time! That is what we’re seeing in the scene with Anakin as well. Acting it out must have been challenging, and it’s quite a lot of range and emotional depth to expect from someone as inexperienced as Hayden Christensen at the time. He has been open about it being a difficult scene. I believe he did his best with what he had, and I hope and expect the new TV-series will redeem him as Anakin after years of unkind criticism. But the line makes sense: Instead of talking about the real pain - losing his mother, having broken with his own principles and ideals as a padawan, his anger against the Jedi council for not making him master, his complicated and illegal feelings for Padme - Anakin talks about something mundane that is so much easier to deal with. Anakin is not the first one to do this. It’s quite common. We get really angry about things and don’t realize that those things are actually not the things that we REALLY have a problem with. We avoid the underlying causes of our misery, because there’s no easy solution. This actually helps explain how Anakin ended up on the dark side. When we suppress primary emotions, we suffer the consequences and end up doing a lot of destructing things, such as hurting the people we actually love. His complaints about sand shows us an individual incapable of addressing real emotional problems in a healthy way."},{"instruction":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

It can make even the strongest man or woman cry like a baby. But fear not, because I'm here to help you get rid of that pain once and for all. As a physical therapist, I've worked with countless patients who have experienced lower back pain. Some of them have tried every remedy under the sun, while others have never even thought about trying anything. So, let's dive in and discover some of the best ways to get rid of that pesky lower back pain! Strengthen Your Core, and I Don't Mean Apple Cores Listen, folks, your core is not just there for show. It's there to support your spine, and a strong core can do wonders for lower back pain. So, what exactly do I mean by \\"core?\\" I'm talking about the muscles that make up your abdomen, hips, and lower back. Strengthening these muscles can help take some of the pressure off your lower back, reducing pain. Now, I know what you're thinking. \\"But Eric, I hate doing sit-ups and crunches.\\" Well, fear not, because there are plenty of other exercises you can do to strengthen your core. Planks, bridges, and bird dogs are just a few examples. Don't be afraid to mix it up and try different exercises to find what works best for you. Get Moving, You Lazy Bones Sitting on your couch all day binge-watching Netflix might seem like a good idea at the time, but it's not doing your lower back any favors. You need to get up and get moving! Walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are all great low-impact exercises that can help alleviate lower back pain. \\"But Eric, what if I can't do those exercises because of my back pain?\\" I hear you, and I have an answer for you. Water aerobics! It's a low-impact exercise that's easy on the joints and great for strengthening muscles. Plus, it's a great way to cool off on a hot day. Trust me, I've seen it work wonders for my patients. Stretch It Out, Baby Stretching is like the secret sauce to getting rid of lower back pain. It can help loosen up tight muscles and improve flexibility, which can help reduce pain. Just make sure you're doing it correctly, or you could end up doing more harm than good. One of my favorite stretches for lower back pain is the double knee-to-chest stretch. Lie on your back, bring both knees up to your chest, and hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat for 5–10 times. It's a simple stretch that can make a big difference. And don't forget to stretch your hamstrings too, as tight hamstrings can contribute to lower back pain. Don't Be Afraid to Seek Professional Help Now, I know what you're thinking. \\"But Eric, I don't want to go to the doctor. They're going to tell me I need surgery or something.\\" I get it. Going to the doctor can be scary, but sometimes it's necessary. If your lower back pain is severe or persistent, it's time to seek professional help. As a physical therapist, I've seen firsthand the benefits of seeking professional help for lower back pain. A physical therapist can evaluate your pain and come up with a customized treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs. Plus, they can teach you proper form and technique for exercises to ensure you're doing them correctly. Wrap It Up, Folks So there you have it, folks. Strengthen your core, get moving, stretch it out, and don't be afraid to seek professional help if needed. These are all great ways to get rid of lower back pain and improve your overall quality of life. But remember, consistency is key. You can't do a few exercises or stretches one time and expect your pain to magically disappear. You have to make a commitment to yourself to stick with it. Now, I know what some of you may be thinking. \\"But Eric, what about pain medications?\\" Look, pain medications may provide temporary relief, but they're not a long-term solution. Plus, they come with their own set of risks and side effects. I'm not saying you should never take pain medications, but they shouldn't be your go-to solution for lower back pain. Are you experiencing back pain or discomfort in your body? DO you want to stop or avoid taking costly and highly addictive pain medication? Discover my secret weapon to help countless of patients.

Here are some strategies that can help you reduce face fat: Calorie deficit: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. This will contribute to overall weight loss, including fat reduction in the face.Balanced diet: Focus on a balanced and healthy diet that includes whole foods, plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid or minimize processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat foods.Hydration: Stay hydrated by drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day. Proper hydration can help improve overall skin health and reduce water retention.Cardiovascular exercise: Engage in regular aerobic exercises like running, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking to burn calories and promote overall weight loss.Facial exercises: Perform exercises that target the muscles in your face and neck to tone and strengthen them. Some examples include cheek lifts, blowing air into your cheeks, and jawline exercises. These exercises may help improve muscle definition and reduce face fat.Facial massage: Gently massaging your face with your fingertips or using a facial roller can help improve blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, which may reduce bloating and puffiness.Limit salt intake: High sodium intake can lead to water retention and bloating, which may make your face appear puffy. Reduce your consumption of salty foods and processed snacks.Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night. Sufficient rest can contribute to overall well-being and may help reduce facial bloating.Avoid excessive alcohol and tobacco: Alcohol and tobacco use can contribute to facial bloating and inflammation. Reducing or eliminating these habits can have a positive impact on your overall health and facial appearance.Patience and consistency: It's important to remember that spot reduction is not possible, and fat loss occurs throughout the body as a whole. Be patient and consistent with your diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to achieve long-term results."},{"instruction":"As a crossdresser, do you like satin silk clothes?

Basically, stupid people with limited vocabulary take an aggressive stand against anybody who knows something they don't. That being the case, it is almost definitional, then. You are defined as a show-off and a jerk if you use extensive vocabulary. There is no way around a definition like this.

If they are having a few drinks or dinner with the possible new supply, they do not want your name popping up on the phone screen for their new and exciting supply to be turned off by. My narc was usually gone for around a week a month. I never found out exactly where he went although probably the worst”New Supply Interview Trip,” he went on was when he received the 8k to pay our mortgage arrears or face having the mortgage go to the receiver and lose it. I built the home and had it 24 years, no problems. Then my Narc decided it would be his free hotel, to come and go, with me there as support whilst he was on the long search for his new supply . 18 months he would come and go, abuse me - physically, mentally, financially, emotionally and I was isolated, not given enough money for food and he destroyed my car so that I could not travel anywhere, see my friends or family and simply go shopping. Initially I thought my Narc was travelling back from the country to our home - we chatted all night and were both excited and looking forward to seeing each other. He was due back at 11pmhowever I got a garbled message just shortly before that saying he was pulling over and having a sleep. I didn’t see him for 5 days after that. The phone was sporadically blocked on and off. Apparently hotels, drugs, hookers etc were all involved and his phone was blocked at different times during the week. Friends knew where he was - with a girlfriend of mine. 8k down, not one cent left and wow…… House back with the received. Now the type of abuse has changed as he is not allowed to physically abuse me. He’s setting me of for all sorts of things that I haven’t done as he wants me in jail apparently. Run for the hills.

I had a good student who was going rogue. She had “endoftheyearitis” and among other things was refusing to wear the dress code shirt. I called home and chatted with dad. Explained the problem, that we only had a few more weeks of school left and I couldn’t see her getting in trouble over something so trivial. Could he help? He said sure. The next day, she came into my office madder than a wet cat. “You!” she shouted. “You got me in trouble!” She then let me know that when she got home from school the previous day, every item of clothing she owned was gone from her room, with the exception of her under clothes and her school uniforms. For the last few weeks of school, she had to wear her uniforms to school, to bed, to the pool, to the mall, to church, to her friend’s houses. Literally everywhere. Needless to say, I was dying. Her dad had told her that if she couldn’t make a smart choice with her clothing, he would take the choice away. And he did. The man should get an award. EDIT - I am getting the biggest kick out of these comments. And don’t get me wrong - I am totally not opposed to a difference of opinion. What’s cracking me up, though, is the assumption that there is some underlying ailment with this child that would provoke her to limit-test this dress code rule and that the father was a horrible human for not addressing it. Let me explain…no, it’s too much…let me sum up. The child in question was not making her choice to violate the dress-code policy based on any insufficiency in her life. She thought the rule was stupid (understandably so) and decided to break it. She understood the rule, had it within her means to follow the rule, had been warned about breaking the rule and chose to do it anyhow. Why? Because that’s what kids do. Stopping at a red light when there is no cross traffic present or coming is stupid. Doing it at 2am is even worse. Without exception, when I am sitting at that stupid red light with not a cross-traffic car in sight, I seriously consider breaking the rule and running the light. Sometimes, I act on my plan. Other times, I don’t. Either way, I understand the rule. So, it’s totally okay to disagree with this dad, but don’t do it based on the idea that the child was misinformed or that her needs were not being met. For sure, she knew exactly what she was doing. Okay, carry on!"},{"instruction":"f you shoot yourself in the chin, would the recoil crush your throat/sever your spinal cord?","output":"No, the recoil is the least of your problems.

Corporations in particular don’t require a bailout in order to settle their debt. Corporations can declare bankruptcy and reorganize or just go out of business. The cost of bankruptcy is absorbed by those who took the risk of investing in the corporation, lending money to the corporation, or selling goods and services to the corporation. All would have prospered if the corporation had done well. Bailouts to corporations and in particular bailouts to banks are justified by governments as being needed in order to prevent a cascading impact on the economy. “Too large to fail”. They might also be justified as necessary for a strategic material. Coal would be a example in an earlier era. Or it might just be good old “crony capitalism” which is just a mild form of socialism in action. Nor do individuals usually need bailouts either. Individual loans are usually handled in much the same way. Individuals declare bankruptcy every day, pay what they can from their existing equity, and eliminate their debt at the cost of poor credit. Lenders typically require secured loans for large debts such as mortgages or cars. As with corporations the individual borrower can then walk away from that debt and start over. No debtors prisons here. Most conservatives I know think that both corporations and individuals are responsible for their debts and need to pay them back or declare bankruptcy in order to relieve themselves from that debt. The problem with student loans is that they were a government inspired effort to stimulate college attendance and did not follow the basic precepts of both corporate or individual loans. First, student loans did not require equity to secure the loan. Nor did they require a parent to co-sign on the loan (again providing equity security). Nor did they limit how the money would be spent. Why would banks be stupid enough to lend large sums of money with little control on how the money was to be spent nor any security in the form of equity in case the loan were to be forfeit? Why? They weren’t stupid. They had a guarantee. The government “guaranteed” the loans and the government effectively eliminated bankruptcy as a means of getting out from under massive debt. The result? Universities grew at a phenomenal rate using the influx of cash provided by student loans. That growth involved offering useless “educational” products that provided no economic benefit to students in the future. Tending bar or coffee shop counters doesn’t provide for paying back loans. In addition universities became bloated with unnecessary bureaucracy that essentially tripled the cost and provided no educational benefit to the student. I worked my way through school. I graduated with zero debt despite zero help from government or parents in paying for my college education. Try doing that today on minimum wage. Impossible. Adding insult to injury state legislators began reducing support to state universities and diverted the money to other programs. Universities prospered and students became buried under massive debt. Now, unlike most unsecured debt, one cannot get out from under a lifetime obligation that in some cases can never be paid back. Its debtors prison without the bars. Are the students responsible? Of course. They took out the loan and agreed to repay it. Every conservative I know would agree with that statement. That’s why the push back on loan forgiveness. I paid for my college education. I paid for my 4 children’s college education. I watched my middle class neighbors forgo paying for the children’s educations and instead had them take out student loans and the resulting debt. They used that money to fuel their own lifestyle at the expense of their children’s future. Now the government wants me to fund my neighbors bass boat and jet ski because they were too selfish and short sighted to help their children. Hard pill to swallow. Do I sympathize with the students. Damn right. They were not legally “defrauded” by the government and the school systems but in my opinion they were ethically defrauded by those parties. They were told from K through 12 that they needed a college degree to be successful. Student loans were easily available with no immediate commitment as to equity or cosigners or any of the normal methods of securing a loan. Seemed free at the time. Are students responsible? Damn right. Are parents, universities, banks, and the federal government responsible as well? I think so. In particular the major beneficiary of this process were the universities who spent that student loan money irresponsibly and provided a low value product in return. Bailout? How about holding some of the other parties to this student loan process accountable? How about fixing the system so that we don’t continue allowing students to incur massive debt? Lets start with no more unsecured student loans. Today. Now. Lets give student loans borrowers the capability of using bankruptcy to eliminate debt. That makes banks do their job. Banks doing their job will put pressure on universities to offer studies with economic value. Would you lend money to a student seeking a degree in low paying field who has no co-signer and no collateral and little opportunity for future earnings? OR Universities need to provide an economically valuable product at a price that the consumer can afford. Perhaps we should make the Universities co-signers or even the loan originator. It is after all the universities that have benefited the most. They need some skin in the game of student loans. Bailout? Maybe when the system is fixed the rules can be changed and allow the student loan recipients to declare bankruptcy. How that would work is unclear to me but it wouldn’t be some blanket relief to everyone. As with every bankruptcy the borrower would have to show necessity, would have to relinquish assets to pay for part of the debt, and suffer the consequences of bad credit."},{"instruction":"Why would a narcissist block you on Facebook then unblock you then block you again?","output":"Playing games.

My definition of retirement is not having to do something you don’t enjoy for money. Like me most people who consider themselves retired still work. For me I did consulting and contracts, but it wasn’t enough so I have a more junior role I enjoy. It keeps me technically sharp and I can work anywhere. However, as I look back at everything I’ve accomplished in life, that my job is low stress and I enjoy it, and that I accomplished everything I sought to do, there’s this constant feeling of “what’s next” vs. “you did it”! It’s caused a strange sense of depression, that the rest of life is wasting away until death, as everything people say they’ll do in retirement I’ve already done. Last weekend I googled wing suit diving and what’s required to get skydiving certified to try and fill that void. I spoke with my Dr who mentioned we’re not told we need a purpose, and while some can get away with volunteering, gardening, golf, or seeing the grandkids for many of us that’s not enough. He didn’t have any answers.

I’m single, don’t drive many miles each year and enjoy driving a new car every three years due to all the new technology that is improved especially the safety features. Leasing has paid off for me for I live in a extremely high traffic, accident prone area. And guess what? Had 7,000 miles on a new Lexus and a girl getting off work, on her cellphone, racing through a parking lot took the entire front end off my car. Cost was 25,000. What do you think that wreck did to the trade in value of my car? With a lease, you aren’t affected by depreciation from an accident. I had a luxury car before that and bought it. Large down payment plus high monthly payments although 1% interest rate and I wasn’t ahead but couple of thousand when I traded it in three years later. Plus had a utility truck back into me slicing through right quarter panel, etc. If I had leased, I would not have been out as much. My current lease with GM and the dealership offered me total maintenance free including oil changes for entire lease period. As many do, offer new rental car while you wait for oil changes, etc. Free car wash anytime. Payment much less than buying. So, if you aren’t keeping your car long enough to outlive the depreciation, lease. If you are like me and want a new car every three years, lease. But if you drive many more than 10,000 to 12,000 miles a year, need to probably buy. Now, to explain my way of thinking. I am older. I’m from the generation you only bought and usually used. We have driven cars and almost cry when we had to get rid of them for they were like a member of the family with all their faults but funny stories later. We spent a vacation once in a service station. It was a toss of a coin it would start on cold mornings. Couldn’t run the ac in traffic or radiator would be boiling over with you looking like you’re driving a steam engine. This list goes on and on. So, I’m driving a new shiny car while I can and until I can’t. I’ve paid off too many cars and had nothing but maintenance issues afterwards. If I want to gamble, I’ll go to Vegas. But that’s just me."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"This works as a parent and grandparent: listen to your kids, and take a little time to observe them.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","output":"I’m answering this long after it’s been posted, but I guess I feel like I should say something. Yes, you absolutely should. The reason I say this is clear: There may be problems going on in the class that you’re unaware of. Your child may be getting bullied by the teacher and the teacher is sending these troublemaker slips home because she doesn’t like him for one reason or another. Your child might be the actual disruptive one! Or he’s fighting back against bullies and the teacher is punishing him. Or, y’know, the teacher is racist against your kid if you’re indigenous/PoC/not white and has decided to bully and belittle him! Ohhh, there’s a story behind that one. Despite how I look, I’m a native american/indigenous person. I had a cool teacher in the beginning of kindergarten that I’ll call Ms. Apple, because her cards for her students were apple shaped (as far as I can recall). About partway through the first semester or so, another kindergarten teacher was hired and Ms. Apple’s class was split in two. I’ll call this second teacher Ms. Bully, because that’s what she was. They split the class down the middle by name and I was sent to Ms. Bully’s class despite multiple tries of me being put back into Ms. Apple’s class. Ms. Bully was… okay, at first, as far as I can remember. I hated being in her class, though. It was just me and another girl who were singled out and bullied, and it really showed. I remember these cards my school gave to kindergarteners who helped out after lunch in the cafeteria or the like, which I’ll call “apple stickers”. It wasn’t my turn to help out, as I was always skipped over on the list of helpers, but I did anyway because I wanted my teacher to be proud of me. I saw her walking down the main building’s hallway to the cafeteria and held up my apple sticker going “Look, Ms. Bully, I got an apple sticker!” Instead of being encouraging, I got told off for doing after-lunch cleanup when it wasn’t my turn. That hurt, honestly. I think I found myself crying about it because she told me off. I’m not sure, as it was a long time ago. Ms. Bully also set the other kids in her class against me and the other indigenous/native american girl. Whenever we played duck, duck, goose, we were the last two to be chosen, if we ever were. We were excluded from most of anything and couldn’t make friends because we were bullied so much at such a young age. I remember vividly about a chart Ms. Bully kept on her wall that she’d rotate people to do different after-lunch activities on different days. She intentionally skipped me when it was supposed to be my turn and I said so. A reasonable teacher’s response would be to apologize and correct their mistake. Not Ms. Bully. She tore the chart down and said something about me having ruined it for everyone or something like that. I cried. My mom, learning about this, was not happy. Neither was the other girl’s family. Two indigenous/native american men soon were sitting in the back of our class while Ms. Bully taught. It didn’t take long for her to finally get caught, but at that point the damage was done. I would be bullied and friendless for the majority of my school days because of the damage Ms. Bully did in that one year of teaching. It was a process, but Ms. Bully ended up being unable to teach ever again because of how she treated me and the other indigenous/native american girl. I actually never saw the indigenous/native american girl again after that year, and later learned that the school I’d gone to didn’t like letting us withdraw because they got money for letting us go and learn there. If someone had stepped in sooner, put us back in Ms. Apple’s class and stopped her earlier, none of this would happen. The icing on the cake was that we all got postcards at the end of the school year. I remember being… happy I got one, but now it kind of hurts to think about because it was due to Ms. Bully that I didn’t have any friends for the rest of my K-8 life. All because she decided to be racist against two five-year-olds and entice the other kids to bully us/exclude us. So yeah, go sit in on your kid’s class. Have someone sit in on your behalf. Watch what happens, and take action before it’s too late. It’s never wrong to do that, especially if it’s in the very beginning of his school life. If it’s later on, schedule a parent-teacher conference, talk to the teacher and then have a trusted friend sit in as it’ll be “too embarrassing” for a parent to sit in on the class."},{"instruction":"Best Online Ph.D. In Computer Science | Accredited Schools Online","output":"There are so many least expensive accredited online degree programs offered by universities across the globe.

AI has allowed us to automate many processes and make them more efficient. It can be used to identify patterns in data and make decisions in areas that are too complex or too dangerous for humans. AI has the potential to improve the accuracy of medical diagnoses, provide better customer service, and increase the efficiency of many industrial processes. AI is also advancing the fields of robotics and autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars are now a reality, thanks to AI's ability to recognize objects and respond to environmental changes. AI is being used to develop robots that can interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously, such as carrying out medical procedures or delivering products. The possibilities of AI are vast, and its potential to revolutionize the world is only beginning to be explored.

Various theories exist, it might have been a question of supply, it might have been a lack of siege equipment. It might have been Hannibals sense that his field army would be chewed up in the rabbit warren of streets in Rome. It might have been an over abundance of caution, he had just won a smashing victory, why risk his irreplaceable men when they had just broken Rome’s back? It’s entirely possible that he believed that Rome would sue for peace in the aftermath of the victory, underestimating the stubbornness of the Roman character.

Both CEO types could work depending on the type/culture of company. Some overall things that every CEO should be doing: 1. Leading executive team communication An effective CEO must be maniacally focused on communication. This involves leading the weekly executive team meeting and having leaders do weekly status updates (I use the app [LINKED_TEXT: Weekly Update] [URL: http://getweeklyupdate.com/] for this). The CEO has to be on top of this, lead by example and ensure the team is effectively communicating and collaborating. 2. Adding A players, removing B/C players Good CEOs are constantly recruiting. They must act to quickly remove low performing people from the team, while at the same time be on the lookout for new A players to join. 3. Documenting the vision and goals The CEO owns articulating the vision and defining measurable goals that are realistic for the team to achieve. 4. Holding the team accountable for performance When the team succeeds, the CEO should give props. When they come up short, the CEO should be clear where the failure was and help the team dissect why it happened so similar situations can be prevented in the future. The CEO is ultimately responsible for delivering results. 5.

So this year i gave my 12 class exams and after that i was left with around 40 day's for neet , i started revision again, and gave almost all test in Aakash , but days passed my studying hours decrease ( reasons are like fear of 12 results , getting less marks in my Aakash test, but this was because i was comparing my performance with a drop student who got almost 670+ in all test and ended up getting 690 in neet with 12 air ) so this was continued till 2 or 3 may till 12 class result came out , i was felling normal cause i didn't got less but also didn't got a lot so after this relative's call u and that stuff happened so the day came of neet exam , and the same day i calculated my marks so i was getting around 490 - 500 , so i was like this is end of 2 year hardwork , and i have to study all again, i cried a lot that day ( but i was surprised that my father said that he was happy because he was expecting only 400 from me) The day results came i was in Gujarat and was well prepared for a rank under 30k in worst case but i checked my result and it was 505 with 46k rank , i was like what 46k , i was sure that i won't get college this year but didn't expected this rank , but that is what it is , But i think i was a fool who studied biology's those chapter which were important like genetics, human reproduction ( i literally did 2 extra books excluding Aakash module), but only 3–4 questions came in exam from genetic from which expected questions are about 7–8 , So i can say i did mistake of studying less in last few days but thus was a paper which made horse and donkeys equal ( ghadha ghoda ek barabar ) i am not saying topper didn't study or those who study do not deserve what they get , but by setting a good paper will have made it easier to get the actual one's out but , but i think what happens, happens for a reason So i am preparing for 2020 and expecting a good paper at least this time Suggestions are welcomed"},{"instruction":"My mom refuses to give my dad my passport and other documents.

Standard Hindi however was deliberately created to remove all these “outsider” influences and create a language that was VERY close to sanskrit. Unfortunately nobody speaks standard Hindi.

This means that the body becomes efficient at using fat for fuel, which can help to reduce hunger and cravings between meals.Intermittent fasting: Some people who eat only once or twice a day practice intermittent fasting, which involves abstaining from food for a certain period of time. This can help to regulate hunger hormones and increase feelings of fullness between meals.Eating nutrient-dense foods: People who eat only one or two meals a day may prioritize eating foods that are high in nutrients and low in empty calories, such as vegetables, fruits, lean protein, and healthy fats. These foods can provide sustained energy and help to keep hunger at bay.Mindful eating: People who eat only one or two meals a day may practice mindful eating, which involves paying attention to hunger and fullness cues and eating slowly and deliberately. This can help to reduce overeating and prevent feelings of hunger between meals.Habituation: Eating only once or twice a day can become a habit over time, and the body may adjust to this eating pattern. Over time, the body may become accustomed to fewer meals and not feel as hungry between them. It's worth noting that not everyone will be able to adjust to eating one or two meals a day, and it's important to listen to your body and eat when you're hungry. It's also important to prioritize nutrient-dense foods and to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients to support your body's needs."},{"instruction":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","output":"Reading through the answers, I'm surprised nobody has mentioned her yet.

I could have got aiims Kalyani and some lower aiims, but I don't find it good to be leaving it. At a point I was inclined towards aiims k but now I find scb better.

Trailblazer’s backpack. As soon as I heard this, I recognized it. It’s just a slightly cursed version of… Heward’s Handy Haversack: A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic fee tin volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even great-er power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fum-bling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.-Dungeon’s and Dragons Dungeon Master’s Guide, 3.5 Edition, p259 It’s just a larger capacity, glitchy recovery Heward’s Haversack. Here’s the worst part. If you read further…she really isn’t a super-hero. Even Batman and Ironman, who relied on gadgets, at least had some training. All someone has to do is steal her haversack…sorry, backpack, and they’re 100% as super as she is. There’s no implication that the “pocket dimension” is tied to her specifically, and not the backpack itself. She’s a wanna-be Sherpa. And I’m guessing she’s not Nepalese, so isn’t that cultural appropriation?

Cartoons are stylized, painting monochromatic is stylized, exaggerating shadows or light is stylizing, etc. Style is a particular way of making art that tends to have something of a signature effect. Abstract is a style in which the art does not represent actual things that exist in the real world, but instead uses shapes, lines, and colors for their own sakes. Here’s an example of something stylized: As you know, humans do not come in shades of blue, orange, and purple naturally, nor are they naturally defined through brush strokes. These are all stylistic elements brought in by the artist, but the artist still made the effort to create something recognizable: a woman’s face. Here’s an example of something abstract: Notice how you can’t actually pick out any objects from the real world out from this painting. It is literally just colors and shapes on a canvas, made largely for aesthetics’ sake rather than to represent anything. This is the essence of abstract; if they ask you to parse out a very specific meaning from an abstract art piece (like “This represents how the artist felt after her divorce” or something like that), they’re playing a prank on you."},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"No. I would have left her the minute I found out she was advertising her extra-marital affairs on social media."},{"instruction":"What is ताजमहल किस नदी के किनारे स्थित हैं?","output":"Agra"},{"instruction":"Why has India ended up as such a corrupt country, while the USA, being another democratic country, has such an organized and lawabiding government in comparison with India?","output":"'Merica has much Less Population sharing much more resources - from Land Area, Petroleum and other natural resources'Merica has a more homogeneous LanguagePurpose of the existence - America is preparing for the next war, while Indians are having a good time while on earth :-)Scars of British occupation.

It’s important to understand what’s causing your pain and be proactive in treating it. There are a number of different ways to reduce and eliminate lower back pain. First, you should check with your doctor about the cause of your pain. They can determine if it’s a muscle strain, herniated disc, arthritis, or something else, and provide the best treatment option. Your doctor may recommend medication, physical therapy, or surgery depending on the cause and severity of your pain. Second, you should improve your posture. Many people experience back pain due to poor posture, such as slouching or sitting for long periods of time. Make sure that you maintain the correct posture when standing, sitting, or sleeping. It’s also important to stretch and exercise regularly to increase strength and flexibility in the back. Third, you should get regular massage treatments. Massage can help reduce muscle tension, improve flexibility, and increase circulation. Massage therapy can also decrease inflammation and improve rehabilitation. Finally, you should practice relaxation techniques. Stress can be a contributing factor to lower back pain. Chronic stress can, over time, cause the muscles and ligaments in the back to become tense and inflamed. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or yoga, can help to reduce stress and pain. Lower back pain can be a very debilitating condition, but with the right treatment and lifestyle changes, it can be managed. Talk to your doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Additionally, be sure to incorporate posture, exercise, massage, and relaxation into your routine in order to reduce the pain and prevent future episodes."},{"instruction":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","output":"“Ek din se kya hota hain??!!” (Burning crackers for a day won’t make any difference!)

Having a specific goal in mind will help you focus the discussion and obtain more relevant and helpful responses.Ask specific questions: Instead of asking open-ended or vague questions, try to be as specific as possible. This helps Chat GPT understand your query better and provide a more targeted response. Break down complex questions into smaller parts if needed.Provide context: Give relevant background information or context for your questions. By providing context, you help Chat GPT understand your situation and provide more accurate and useful responses.Critical thinking and verification: Chat GPT is a powerful tool, but it's important to remember that it generates responses based on patterns it has learned from training data. Exercise critical thinking and cross-check information obtained from Chat GPT with reliable sources to verify its accuracy.Be aware of limitations: While Chat GPT can provide helpful information and insights, it may not always have access to the most up-to-date or complete information.

اپنی دوسری مسلسل فتح حاصل کی۔ اس فتح نے انہیں ویسٹرن کانفرنس میں ساتویں نمبر پر پہنچا دیا، جو کہ گولڈن اسٹیٹ واریئرز سے فائنل میں پلے ان ٹورنامنٹ سے بچنے کے لیے صرف 1.5 گیمز پیچھے ہے۔ ناز ریڈ نے شاندار 73.3% شوٹنگ پر 26 پوائنٹس حاصل کرتے ہوئے ٹمبر وولز کے لیے اسکورنگ چارج کی قیادت کی۔ دیگر اہم شراکت داروں میں جیڈن میک ڈینیئلز، کارل-انتھونی ٹاؤنز، ٹورین پرنس اور مائیک کونلی شامل تھے، جن میں سے سبھی نے 10+ پوائنٹس حاصل کیے۔ جبکہ Timberwolves -3.5-پوائنٹس کے اسپریڈ کو پورا کرنے میں ناکام رہے، گیم میں حاصل کیے گئے 249 مشترکہ پوائنٹس نے آرام سے 242 پوائنٹس کے پری گیم مارک کو پیچھے چھوڑ دیا۔ جمعہ کی رات، گولڈن اسٹیٹ واریرز نے گھر پر فلاڈیلفیا 76ers کا مقابلہ کیا اور 120-112 سے فتح حاصل کی۔ واریئرز کو 4.5 پوائنٹس کی حمایت ملی اور اسپریڈ کا احاطہ کیا۔ گیم میں اسکور کیے گئے کل پوائنٹس 232

بمقابلہ Warriors Player Props جس میں Steph Curry، Klay Thompson اور Rudy Gobert شامل ہیں ذیل میں پلیئر پروپس کے لیے ہماری پسندیدہ Timberwolves بمقابلہ Warriors کی پیشین گوئیاں ہیں۔ Steph Curry کے لیے بہترین شرط o34.5 (-115) پر پوائنٹس اور اسسٹ کے لیے اوور پر شرط لگانا ہے۔ گزشتہ دس گیمز میں، کری کے اوسطاً 36.1 پوائنٹس اور فی گیم اسسٹس ہیں، جو بیٹنگ لائن سے زیادہ ہے۔ مزید برآں، اپنے حالیہ کھیلوں کی اکثریت میں، اس نے پوائنٹس اور اسسٹ کے لیے اوور مارا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، اس کے آخری پانچ گیمز میں، اس کے پاس فی گیم کم از کم 35 پوائنٹس اور اسسٹس ہیں، جو o34.5 لائن سے زیادہ ہے۔ مزید برآں، کری حال ہی میں اچھا کھیل رہا ہے، اس نے اپنے آخری دس گیمز میں سے چھ میں کم از کم 30 پوائنٹس اسکور کیے، جس سے اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ وہ اس بیٹنگ لائن پر اوور کرنے کے لیے کافی اسکور کر سکتا ہے۔ لہذا، پوائنٹس اور اسسٹ کے لیے اوور پر بیٹنگ o34.5 (-115) پر حالیہ ڈیٹا کی بنیاد پر بہترین شرط ہوگی۔ Klay Thompson کے لیے، ہماری بہترین شرط 21.5 سے زیادہ پوائنٹس ہوں گے جو -125 مشکلات پر اسکور کیے گئے ہوں۔ کلے کا سیزن اوسطاً 21.78 پوائنٹس فی گیم ہے، اور اس نے اپنے آخری دس گیمز میں سے چھ میں 22.5 پوائنٹس سے زیادہ اسکور کیے ہیں، آخری دس میں فی گیم 20.0 پوائنٹس کی اوسط کے ساتھ۔ اس سے پتہ چلتا ہے کہ وہ اپنے آنے والے مخالفین کے خلاف 21.5 پوائنٹس سے زیادہ سکور کر سکتا ہے، خاص طور پر ان کی حالیہ کارکردگی کو دیکھتے ہوئے. جبکہ 26.5 سے زیادہ پوائنٹس اور -115 مشکلات پر ری باؤنڈز بھی ایک اچھی شرط ہو سکتی ہے، Klay کی حالیہ ری باؤنڈنگ اوسط 3.8 فی گیم کافی کم ہے، جس سے اس پر شرط لگانا کم قابل اعتماد ہے۔ اسی طرح، -145 اوڈز پر بنائے گئے 3.5 سے زیادہ تھری پوائنٹرز ایک پرکشش آپشن ہو سکتے ہیں، لیکن Klay کی فی گیم 3.8 کی حالیہ اوسط لائن سے کوئی خاص فرق نہیں ہے، جو اسے کم سازگار شرط بناتی ہے۔ لہذا، کلے تھامسن پر 21.5 سے زیادہ پوائنٹس حاصل کرنا بہترین شرط ہے۔ جہاں تک روڈی گوبرٹ کا تعلق ہے، وہ اس سیزن میں اوسطاً 11.5 ریباؤنڈز لے رہے ہیں اور اپنے آخری چار مقابلوں میں سے تین میں کم از کم 12 ریباؤنڈز حاصل کر چکے ہیں۔ کارل انتھونی ٹاؤنز کے ساتھ آج رات کے واریئرز کے مقابلے کے لیے مشکوک ہونے کے ساتھ، گوبرٹ کے 10.5 ریباؤنڈز (-122) پر اوور لینا آج رات ٹمبر وولز کے بڑے آدمی کے لیے ڈالنا ہماری بہترین شرط ہے۔ Timberwolves بمقابلہ Warriors بہترین شرط اور انتخاب اتوار کی رات، ہماری بہترین شرط واریئرز پر ہے تاکہ پھیلاؤ کا احاطہ کریں۔ گھر پر ان کا 30-7 (81.1%) کا متاثر کن ریکارڈ انہیں گھریلو جیتنے کے فیصد میں مجموعی طور پر تیسرے نمبر پر رکھتا ہے، اور ان کے پاس 25-11-1 (69.4%) کے ساتھ گھر پر بہترین ATS ریکارڈ ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ،

Chole Bhature is also a must try but it is very filling, you cannot have anything after that In main course you can try Dal Makhani and any Paneer (cottage cheese) curry. If you like non vegetarian then you can go for chicken and mutton curries. In flat bread, you should definitely try Butter Naan or Stuffed Naan. If visiting South Indian restaurant, you should definitely try Dosas and Idli. In dosas, I always prefer Masala Dosa as I am vegetarian, but you can get non vegetarian versions as well.

Either expression is civilised."},{"instruction":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","output":"The main constraint is motivation. People take CS to get a coding job instead of physics to produce Star Trek technology. You can blame companies like Microsoft, which have turned an entire generation into “coders” who are not interested in the “Space Age” technology that made the sixties so spectacular. To produce the innovation you are talking about, physics needs to be as popular as IT, so that people are building novel devices in their dorm-room the way they produce things like Snapchat. One way to popularise physics is to use VR to create a virtual Starfleet Academy, so that people can learn Relativity and quantum mechanics aboard a virtual Starship Voyager, but this is unlikely to happen, since VR is in the hands of software companies that see it as technology to be used for third-person shooter or superhero games. If physics could be popularised, there would be a lot more people like Elon Musk."},{"instruction":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","output":"I honestly feel that you should let him keep making music if it makes him happy."},{"instruction":"What is swing trading?","output":"Swing trading is a trading strategy that involves holding stocks or other securities for a period of time that can range from a few days to a few weeks.

That can be anything from a political agenda to a religious, social, cultural, or economic agenda. If you’re going to write about what you perceive to be the truth, then tell it like it is and don’t make obvious sugar coats. In the context of fiction or story-telling, George R.R.

They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up.\\" Gardening style of writing: \\"The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it,\\" he told the Guardian. \\"They kind of know what seed it is, they know if [they] planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows.\\" The gardening style of writing clearly works well if you’re trying to create legendary characters, but I think the Architect style works better for most people. A good writer should always plan out what he’s going to say before he says it. I very much deplore the “soundbite” technique that corporate advertisers and political debates are premised on, and when I see it used as a writing style, I automatically assume that the writer isn’t very smart and therefore not worth listening to."},{"instruction":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

Someone told me that if we hit the proton with its antimatter, it would go away? Does it expire or turn into energy? Which one is real?","output":"oh my - where to start? first: what is matter? most people would define matter as something, that is somehow composed of fermions - aka, particles with spin 1/2. this begs the question: how would these people categorize bosons - particles with spin 0 or 1? both are particles. what is a particle? well - on very low level you only have fields. those fields fill up all points in space and time. and yes - they overlap. if you put the right amount of energy into those fields, you can create something called a local excitation. if you think about a standing wave, you are wrong but not completely. it’s a useful analogy even if it is not correct. and yes - particles are just that - excitations of the underlying field. a packet of energy in that field, if you like. what is mass? mass is an intrinsic property of a particle. it defines how much that particle is able to resist an acceleration. therefore mass is the same as inertia. but where does that inertia come from? well - most fields can interact with a special field: the higgs field. this field is special as every point of that field has a positive energy content even if it is not excited. if one field interacts with the higgs field, it can “borrow” some of that energy. that energy is then confined in an excitation of that field. but as einstein already showed: confined energy behaves for an outside observer just the same as inertia - you can’t distinguish between them in an experiment. therefore we define mass simply as intrinsic potential energy. and yes - that e=mc² business is exactly that: the realisation, that mass is just a special form of energy. one of the principles, that we think is universally true, is the principle of conservation of energy. you can’t create or destroy energy. you can only convert it from one form into another. if you have a proton, it is comprised of three valence quarks, various gluons and some quark-anti-quark-pairs. all of these particles are excitations of their corresponding fields. if you bring in an anti-proton, it is also comprised of quarks and gluons - but all of them have the exact opposite charge. we call quarks, we usually see in normal life, “normal” quarks and quarks with the opposite change “anti-quarks”. this is just convention - you could call them left-quarks and right-quarks or whatever. it doesn’t matter. what matters is: both the quark and the anti-quark are excitations of the same field. if you bring them close enough together, they both cancel out - the excitations cease to exist. but the energy of those excitations can’t simply disappear - it must go somewhere else. the quarks inside a proton are quite light-weight: they contain relatively little energy. there are not that many other particles, that have less energy. usually, all the energy of those quarks is “transfered” into the electromagnetic field, where it creates other excitations. we call excitations of the electromagnetic field “photons”. and if some of these photons hits you, we call it “light”. so yeah - if you define matter as stuff, that is solely comprised of fermions, then you can completely destroy matter - by transfering the energy, that is stored in those fermions into other fields, that are associeted with bosons. the easiest way is to transfer the energy into the electromagnetic field - you convert matter into light. and yes - some people would define light (aka photons/bosons) as “pure energy”. this is of course wrong - there is nothing like “pure energy”. there are only different forms of energy, that can be converted into another. so - what you can do is to transfer energy from one field to another. there are some rules, how this energy transfer can occur. some transfer modes are easier to achieve then others. some are “forbidden” (aka: have never been observed in a laboratory). and yes - in a way, you could call the transfer of energy from some quark field into the electromagnetic field as destruction of matter."},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

One is that leasing a car can be a more affordable alternative to buying it outright because the monthly payments are substantially less than what you would pay for instalment loans or car loans.Another reason is that leasing means you won't have any negative equity if your vehicle needs major repairs, as all depreciation will be recovered when the lease terminates.Thirdly, as an employee with your company's fleet, you may qualify for corporate lease rates at either low or no interest rate which could result in lower monthly costs.It's also possible to combine down payment and trade-in options through this program and still receive reduced rates and terms on your new vehicle thus creating significant savings over other alternatives.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"Put simply It all comes down to your mind set. So you may have a 150+ IQ, but that doesn't mean you’re free from some of the burdens in life like depression, lack of self worth and/or belief and/or self loathing. If one suffered from any of those thoughts IQ plays a very little part in their life. Advantages are there but you need to know how to use them. Having a 150+ IQ doesn't mean you know how to use it to your advantage without putting in the work and learning how to use it. Finding ones self, taking reflection on who you are, who you want to be and what you need to do to get there are things you need to figure out before you can use your IQ as an advantage. A 150+ IQ is someone who is thought to be a genius. This theory always makes me laugh. Yes someone may have a huge advantage in the thought processes of a particular task but that doesn't mean that they'll excel with everything they do in life. In a lot of instances people with a really high IQ find some tasks difficult that people with an IQ of 100 have no issues with. Personally I see my strengths as being analytical. Patterns, numbers even the power of foresite (Dr Emitt Brown from the Back to the Future series calls this seeing 4th dimensionally) mankind is known as being a lazy spieces. This is why we invent or create items that make the jobs we need to do easier. I'm great at making things in my life easier now days. Disadvantages are there defienity. Previously I mentioned that simple mundane tasks can be difficult, having good communication skills, Being able to communicate with others on the same level also doing this without sounding ignorant or arrogant can be difficult. Sometimes you may be seen as being insensitive or have a lack of understanding. Emotionally challenged individuals have it worse as a lot of times they're seen as being cold or heartless. Being able to analyze things is great till you over analysis it. Sometimes things works to well for their or your own good. LOL. Speaking from experience. If you are at peace with yourself and the world then yes it's so great being 150+ but they also say that igonarance is bliss so Maybe having an IQ of under 100 is that much better. Maybe if I got dementia some day I'd be able to debate. I haven't read anyone else's replies so I'm guessing a lot may be similar.

All species are probably related - so right from the start you do not understand how evolution works.If we have parallel evolution, the two species will LOOK like they have evolved the same function, but when we compare the DNA we see the same function evolved twice.For example, we now know there are two branches of “bats”. The common ancestor of all bats was not a bat. The flying mammal species we call “bats” today evolved twice in two different lines of inheritance.There is some similarity of human eye and octopus eye. Yet the common ancestor of both was probably a light sensitive spot on a tiny invertibrate species that could not fossilise, and we would probably not notice today if they were still around but not very numerous.The genome is statistically unlikely to evolve to become more similar. DNA evolves by both random variation and selection. Even when the same approximate function is evolved, it is much less likely it is the same protein, and almost impossible for the part of the genome for that function to be even remotely “identical”.The genome is for all intents and purposes impossible to “converge” - even if the two species of bats look exactly the same. Evolution is always about how much the genome diverges, not converges, and only sexual function can reduce the “divergence” by “correcting” for deviations in one parent with the sequence from the other parent that did not diverge. The two species of bats that look exactly the same but have an ancestor in common that was not at bat will have a record of the divergence in their DNA. We expect the genome to diverge, even with parallel evolution making it look like they both inherited it from the common ancestor. In fact, even with human beings we see evidence that our own evolution has both divergence of genome and convergence of function. There is now some evidence that shows that the common ancestor of humans and chimps walked upright a lot more than chimps do now.Making it entirely possible that human evolution evolved bipedal locomotion TWICE, while chimpanzee evolution evolved it only once, and then evolved back again so they could not run with tools in their hands.Even before we had the DNA and fossil evidence, we already noticed that chimpanzees did not walk on two feet the way we did - suggesting that at a time in the past - presumably before the split with our line - our ancestors in common walked more than they do now, albeit a little less than australopithicines did.And blonde hair is now proved to have evolved in “parallel evolution” - functionally identical, genetically diverse - in different human “races”. So in summary: Evolution is statistically DIVERGENCE OF GENOME.Evolution can be - if the selection “rule” is the same - CONVERGENCE of FUNCTION."},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"Here are some[LINKED_TEXT: general things ] [URL: https://amzn.to/3LCaAtN]that one should avoid doing in life: Don't be afraid to take risks and pursue your dreams.

Examples like, “She's BREATHING on me!” and “The girls are WHISPERING to each other, I can't hear them and they are talking about ME!” The tattletale was made to wear the tail, which was a good 15 feet long, for the day if the tattler could not refrain from pestering Mom.

Hotels can range from fairly cheap to very expensive, but you generally get what you pay for. The best way to reduce the cost of a hotel is to compare hotel prices. This used to be a difficult and time-consuming task, but the Internet has changed all that. Sites like Travelocity and Expedia are a great way to make a hotel deal because they can negotiate a lower price on your behalf. The problem is that there are now so many websites that offer this service that it is difficult to know which ones can offer you the best offer. Previously you had to do a hotel price comparison between hotels, now you have to do the comparison between hotel booking websites. Fortunately, the Internet has come to the rescue again. Now there are websites where you can compare prices from all the online booking sites. This is the best way to ensure you get the best deal possible. There is no secret to getting a good price on a hotel room, it's just a matter of comparing hotel prices. The Internet has greatly simplified this process, but it has also created new problems. There are now so many websites promising the best hotel rates that it can be difficult to choose just one. Fortunately, several new websites have appeared where you can compare prices across all the online booking sites and see who really has the best prices."},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"Tracing someone's name through a mobile number can be challenging, as personal information is generally protected and not publicly available. However, there are a few methods you can try: 1. Reverse Phone Lookup Websites: Many online platforms allow you to perform a reverse phone lookup, where you enter the mobile number and receive publicly available information associated with it. Popular websites for this purpose include Whitepages, Truecaller, and Spy Dialer. 2. Social Media Search: If the person has linked their mobile number to their social media accounts, you can try searching for the phone number on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn. If the number is associated with their account, you may find their profile. 3. Search Engines: Simply entering the mobile number into search engines like Google or Bing might provide some relevant information if the person has used that number publically on websites, directories, or forums. 4. Contact the Mobile Service Provider: In certain cases, if there is a valid reason, you may contact the mobile service provider and request information about the owner of a particular number. However, this approach may require legal authorization or a legitimate investigation. It's important to note that privacy laws and regulations vary across countries, so make sure to comply with local laws and respect the privacy of others when attempting to trace someone's name through a mobile number."},{"instruction":"w can cells be seen with the naked eye?","output":"Yep all of them"},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"I though I would add some supporting information to [LINKED_TEXT: Rob Hilleary] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Rob-Hilleary]’s answer.

He wants to move out, but the property management says they will not remove him from the lease. Can property management do that?","output":"There are many small details to consider but here are some things to look at. It might be obvious but some quick legal advice is best. Local volunteer tenant boards and associations often have legal advisors on hand who can help for no fees but small donation would be appreciated. Verify if your lease is actually with the PM company or if they are in fact assigned as the owners agent. Often a PM company only administers lease terms and collects rent but are not a “legal agent” or “party” to the lease contract. If they are not authorized to act as an agent or not a party to the lease, they may not have the authority to remove him. If this is the case you can seek an agreement with the actual owner to amend your contract and remove him. If you are agreeing to continue the lease commitment they may well agree. Having his name on the lease as an occupant is different form being a party to the contract. his name may appear as an occupant or dependant but if he did not sign, they may just wish to have more “names to hunt” in a default situation. If you are already ok with your son moving out and can carry the lease commitment out to the end on your own, his leaving should have little or no impact unless you default. Another simple solution is to find another room-mate with good credit and they will probably allow a substitution of co-tenant/ occupant. In some jurisdictions, if he was under 18, legally a minor or not of age to make or be party to a contract at time of entering the lease contract, it is possibly not binding.

I suddenly came across a question, which triggered in my memory a story which I heard during my childhood. I typed that story in the answer and just added one more sentence after the story. I closed my laptop and boarded the flight. When I got down from the flight in Chennai and checked my Quora feed (after around 4 hours), I was amazed to see that my answer (written in just 10 minutes) has already got around 4,000 upvotes.

My first book ‘Practising Spiritual Intelligence’ was published in 2013. It took me almost 6 months to complete the book and another two years to edit and finally see my book on the bookshelf. It takes around one to two years to write a book, get it edited and published and I have published 7 books so far in last 7 years. However, my latest book ‘Essay and Answer Writing for UPSC Civil Services’ was written with least effort and accidentally. In the month of February 2020, I got an email from Disha Publication inviting me to write a book for them for UPSC examination. I had already written a book for UPSC for ‘Ethics, Integrity and Aptitude’, which was being published by Wisdom Tree.

You asked about my life experience (even if not me specifically), and I’m flattered so I want to answer. Here’s 2011 me, taken at a ukulele festival in Indiana. I poured a ton of my time and energy and what little money I had at the time into being part of the “ukulele community” (I put it in quotes, but it really is a wonderful, welcoming, and tight knit group of people) I had too much to drink and wound up embarrassing myself. My wife and I had a 1 year old daughter and lived in a two bedroom apartment in Maryland. I worked with a nonprofit to support adults who have developmental disabilities in the workplace. I was living a pretty day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence, and I actually thought it was a good idea to be seen in public wearing a porkpie hat: And here’s 2016 me: I still like hats. This is me doing a live PA techno / ambient performance at a gaming convention. I wound up drinking far too much and leaving my headphones at the bar (though I was able to recover them the next day). I pour a ton of my time, energy, and spending money into my efforts at becoming a vaguely successful electronic musician. I’m financially stable, and I live in a 3 bedroom townhouse. I’ve got two kids now, ages 6 and 4. I’m still happily married to the same woman. I’ve been working as a special education teacher for about four and a half years. I’ve had my left ankle replaced with an artificial joint. I look and feel quite a bit older, but someone on the outside looking in may disagree. See, it’s tough to compare 27 year old me with 32 year old me because I see 27 year old me through the lenses of nostalgia, regret, and the knowledge of how those choices turned out for me in the end. It’s impossible to look at myself now objectively, but here are my impressions of how I think I’ve changed as a result of my formative experiences over the last five years: I’m a lot more comfortable with who I am these days—I realize that just because I’m a grown ass man now I’m not immune to changing. I’ve realized that when I had less money and lived in less comfortable digs, many of my life choices were made out of real or perceived urgency or necessity. Now that I have job security and financial stability, it’s easier to slow down and think through things more carefully. I’ve admitted to myself that I struggle with depression and anxiety and I’ve sought help. Seeking help was a helpful thing to do. My priorities have shifted from day to day survival to thinking about long term goals. Goals are something I’ve never really had—I always put the responsibility of setting life goals aside in favor of worrying about whether or not I’m going to have a job in six weeks or how I’m going to scrape together enough money to pay the rent. Granted, I’ve never lived in abject poverty, but things were tight enough that sorting out the affairs of the next month were enough to keep me from thinking about the lack of intentionality in my life. These changes happened gradually, and I still don’t have it all figured out. I can’t point to one thing and say “That is my formative experience.” Perhaps it would be easier to really know myself if I did have one singular life-changing event. But I don’t think life generally happens that way."},{"instruction":"Can a shower caddie that hangs on the shower head damage the plumbing?","output":"Bath Beyond [LINKED_TEXT: Shower Caddy] [URL: https://www.amazon.com/BATHBEYOND-Shower-Caddy-Suction-2Tier/dp/B07V72JDKR/] - Our Shower Shelf Organize Your Shower Space Large capacity to organize your shower essentials and keep them all within easy reach, stainless steel construction is corrosion-resistant and easy to clean. and This Adjustable Shower Caddy have a Dual Suction Cup System.

This room in the photo is of the Echo room at Abbey Road EMI studios in London England. The history of sound effects, and how they were first discovered and applied in the recording industry is a very large one, I won’t delve into this too deeply because Quora readers prefer concise, informative answers. This effect of Echo could be adjusted, but of course the expense and physical demands for this effect meant that only very well resourced, wealthy recording companies could manage to use these effects. The Digital age, of course changed all of this. It was discovered that emulation of physical space could be achieved using chips/transistors and chains of circuits -as in the Bucket-Brigade circuit which has been used to great effect to create delay effects. Reverberation, or Reverb for short, was one of the earliest sound effects to be used, reverb produces a sense of space, it is a form of delay but the reflections are very short as if the voice, or instrument is originating from a much larger room, or physical space, Delay is similar to Reverb but the differences are found in the extent, and timing of reflections. A dedicated Delay pedal can be adjusted to produce simple reverb, but you also have the option to adjust the delay parameters to produce actual repeats of the original signal, you have considerably more flexibility. Reverb by itself is a simple form of delay, and you can also adjust this to a certain extent, but with reverb you never have a repeat of the original signal, it is all about reflection of one original sound, this may be adjusted to produce a very large space, if you go to ‘10’, Dick Dale was a guitar player in the ‘Surf Rock’ genre and he was noted for his use of lots of Reverb from his Fender Twin amplifiers. So the essential differences between a Reverb pedal and a Delay pedal is the ‘repeat’ capability of your delay device, this can give you a wide range of repeat parameters, whereas the Reverb pedal will provide a sense of spatial distance, you cannot set a repeat on the original sound."},{"instruction":"Which is the affordable bulk SMS marketing service provider in Bangalore?","output":"They are many, you can still feel free to reach www.stridist.in"},{"instruction":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","output":"Just don't"},{"instruction":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","output":"The year is 2006.

Would he have been dragged through the street like Gaddafi?","output":"Mussolini and his mistress in Milan You raise an interesting question. From history, we know what Hitler thought would happen to him and his mistress, Eva Braun. Mussolini and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, we’re executed by Italian Parsons on April 28, 1945. Their bodies were then, after much abuse, strung up from an Esso station in the city of.Milan. News of the execution of Mussolini and his mistress reached Hitler on afternoon of April 29, 1945. On April 30, 1945, Hitler and his mistress, Eva Braun, committed suicide shortly before the city of Berlin fell to Soviet soldiers. Some historians believe that what happened to Mussolini was a factor in Hitler's decision to commit suicide and have his body burned. Alan Bullock said that news of Mussolini's fate had presumably increased Hitler's determination to avoid capture. William Shirer thought that knowledge of the events surrounding Mussolini's death may have strengthened Hitler's resolve not to risk his downfall being turned into a public humiliation. Ian Kershaw states that while it is uncertain whether Hitler was told the details of Mussolini's death: if he did learn of the full gory tale, it could have done no more than confirm his anxiety to take his own life before it was too late, and to prevent his body from being seized by his enemies There is a general agreement among most historians, however, that had Hitler and his mistress, Eva Braun, been taken alive, they would have been subject to many of the same humiliation that Mussolini and his mistress were subject to.

We couldn't get her out of our labor and delivery for over 8 days, because after a negative work up, we'd discharge her and she'd go out in the parking lot or go to nearby restaurant and fake her seizure and be brought right back in by ambulance. Finally we asked her what out would take to get her out, and she requested a bus ticket back home to Florida.

An alarmingly large number of “science demonstrations” on YouTube are faked. To pick the very first one I found: It claims to come from “The Visual Education Project”- which doesn’t seem to have any web information except YouTube videos like this one. It claims to be showing a perpetual motion machine. The details of how it claims to work are rather unimportant - because it’s clearly impossible. The laws of thermodynamics guarantee it’s a fake. One VERY suspicious thing happens when the presenter places the green ball onto the extreme left of the track. The ball is rolled towards the center - which would mean that with the red ball farther from the center than the green one - that the machine would stay tipped to the right - and as the green ball hits the end-stop at the center of the machine - the transfer of momentum should re-enforce the motion to the right…but it doesn’t…the contraption starts to tip to the left at precisely the time it should be tipping to the right. Even without knowing much physics - it somehow feels “wrong”. At time 0:37 - the green ball is still closer to the center than the red ball - yet the machine is tipping to the left. How is that even possible? If you watch it closely enough - the plank tips BEFORE the balls start rolling in that direction…which makes no sense. It’s possible though that it’s even simpler than that. Here are two screen captures from the video: Do you see a thin black line under each end of the board? CONCLUSION: This video is a fake - the presenter is a liar and a cheat - he’s clearly manipulating the motions of the board using two threads that run through the table top. 3 million YouTube views means that he’s making a lot of money from gullible people. Scientists look at something like this - and IMMEDIATELY know - for 100% sure - that it’s a fake. There is some small intellectual challenge to figure out HOW it’s faked - but there are a dozen ways it could be faked - it’s just a matter of which one was applied here."},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ?

However, to determine the appropriate size, you can follow these general guidelines: Measure your hand: Use a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your dominant hand just below the knuckles. Make sure to measure around the widest part of your palm.Consult the size chart: Most glove manufacturers provide size charts that correlate hand circumference measurements with glove sizes. These charts can typically be found on the product packaging or the manufacturer's website.Consider fit and preference: Weightlifting gloves should fit snugly but not be overly tight. The gloves should allow for proper finger movement and a comfortable grip on the weights. Keep in mind that different brands may have slight variations in sizing, so it's a good idea to read customer reviews or try on gloves if possible. It's worth noting that some individuals prefer not to use gloves while weightlifting, as they prefer the direct contact and improved grip with the weights. Ultimately, the choice of wearing gloves or not is a personal preference based on factors such as comfort, grip, and protection.

However, there have been concerns about the safety of cooking food in a microwave oven. In particular, some people worry that the radiation emitted by microwave ovens can be harmful to human health. The good news is that there is no evidence to suggest that microwave ovens are dangerous when used properly. The type of radiation used by microwave ovens is non-ionizing, which means that it does not have enough energy to break apart molecules or cause cellular damage. In fact, microwave ovens are considered to be one of the safest cooking methods available. That being said, there are some potential hazards associated with microwave ovens. For example, if the [LINKED_TEXT: microwave oven parts] [URL: https://www.partsips.com/amana-appliance-parts], such as the door or the seals, are damaged, then there is a risk of radiation leakage. This can be dangerous, so it is important to have your microwave oven inspected regularly to ensure that all parts are in good working order. Another concern is that microwave cooking can lead to a loss of nutrients in the food. This is because the high heat generated by the microwave oven can cause some of the vitamins and minerals in the food to break down. However, this is not unique to microwave cooking and can happen with any form of cooking that uses high heat. It is also important to note that some types of plastic containers can release harmful chemicals when heated in a microwave oven. To avoid this, use microwave-safe containers and avoid using plastic wrap or containers that are not specifically labeled as microwave-safe. In conclusion, cooking food in a microwave oven is generally considered safe, provided that the appliance parts are in good working order. While there are some potential hazards associated with microwave cooking, these can be easily avoided by using microwave-safe containers and regularly inspecting your microwave oven. So go ahead and heat up your leftovers without worry – your microwave oven is a safe and convenient way to prepare food."},{"instruction":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","output":"India’s First Train: Contrary to popular belief, the first train in India was the Red Hill Railway, which ran from Red Hills to Chintadripet bridge in 1837.

India is import oriented country where we Imports more compared to export. So in order to pay our high import oil, gold and other items bill we need to pay them in dollor and for it we required foreign currency reserve and to get the foreign currency we need other international market to import our good ( Export for us) for this our goods should be cheaper for this our currency value should also be lower. But suppose if one dollor is equal to one rupee then who so ever will buy the products from india same things they will buy from other country where currency rates are cheaper or else he would buy the same product from USA only. Thus our export will be lower and Import will be higher. Thus the current account deficit of our country will be no longer positive and than how we will be in the condition which we cannot even think about it. Lot of international companies and industrialists are coming and investing in India just beacuse of cheap availability of labour and factory setup. And this investment is very much required for a country like India to develop its infrastructure. Here if one rupee is equal to one dollar than why foreign companies would coming to India and will invest here instead of it they will prefer to invest in USA only or else they would go to more chepar country. For more clarity of your concept lets take an exapmle of bpo kpo services. Millions of Indians people are working in this BPO companises i.e. Genpact, Accenture, Wipro, Infosys etc. So what these companies are doing they are working for companies based on UK and USA. so why these companies in UK and US are giving jobs to india. Is it that they dont have the people to work for them? Is it, If you are thinking like that then you are wrong because If a USA company hiring a US employee than they will have to at least pay them for 4000–5000 per month whereas they get the same work done by outsourcing them to Indian BPO at low labor cost of around 300-400. So you can think how much they are saving. But the fact is that we are getting employment for millions of people for them. But the income is relevant here 300–400 is sufficent for a you g graduate.

We called this the the Math Torture Vent. My mom used to make me kneel on it while I memorized my multiplication table up to 12x, when I was five years old. If I lost focus and didn’t rehearse quickly enough, my knee caps would start bleeding. We used to play this math game in elementary school where students would go head-to-head to see who could answer multiplication questions first.

While photography may be new, color photography is a far more recent development. Perhaps this is why B&W images are used (and often ideal) for creating a certain sense of timelessness. Experimental Photography Experimental photography uses photo manipulation to alter our perceptions as well as our expectations. Photographers often use this type of art to tell a story or create art specific to their cause (e.g. cover art, fantastical photographs, and even advertisements). Travel Photography Travel photography can be deeply personal or highly sellable, depending on the specific content. We’ve all seen (and drooled over) travel blogs and websites, in which people document everything from Stonehenge to hotel rooms. In defining travel photography, it really comes down to the story; the photographer captures new sites and we get to see those sites from their perspective. Landscape Photography Landscape photography is perhaps one of the most traditional photography styles, and it’s no mystery as to why; our world has fantastic views. Capturing landscapes through photography is a powerful skill, as it often allows an honest documentation of nature. However, you may notice landscape photography does not always capture nature exclusively Fashion Photography Fashion photography is a high-end genre focused on showcasing clothing and products. This style of photography is commonly associated with magazines like Elle, Vogue, Vanity Fair, and other lifestyle features.

In summary, though: The bottom line is that a pianist can easily play the organ not very well. It’s not like switching to, say, the guitar or the oboe where you won’t even know how to produce the notes. You will be able to play them, in the literal sense of putting your fingers in the right places, from day one. But they won’t necessarily sound great. Playing the organ well requires learning quite a few new things and unlearning quite a lot of old ones. The same applies to organists moving to the piano (though in reality most organists started on the piano anyway). And, of course, it’s important to consider what kind of organ playing the pianist is being called upon to do. If it’s just playing a few hymns for church, the transition isn’t going to be too demanding. For example, though it will be necessary to get used to the very different approach to articulation (especially legato) on the organ, it’s perfectly possible to play hymns well without using the pedals and without complex stop changes. On the other hand, if you want to play substantial pieces of organ repertoire, there’s a lot more to learn. As an aside: pedals are less important in most organ playing than most non-organists realise - they’re there, sure, but the pedal part is rarely the most challenging or significant thing about a piece. There is a lot of quite major organ repertoire where the role of the pedals is minimal."},{"instruction":"the NDA training the toughest?","output":"Watch this video and you would get an idea.
