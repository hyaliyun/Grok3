Also, consider its server size and whether its bandwidth meets your requirements and if it's compatible with the SMS gateway you have selected.After the second step, you should set up a database on that server. You can access the administration panel in the server by using the user ID/username and the password that your web host provides. Proceed towards the 'Database' section and begin the database setup. You need to specify the name of the database, your ID/username and your password for database access.Install the application for SMS gateway on the systems that you will use for creating and sending SMS messages. You'll have to give access of the SMS gateway to your database. It can be done by entering the URL to your database provided by your host, the database ID/username, and your password in the panel of gateway administration.Finally, the last step would be to examine the functionality of your SMS gateway system. For this, you can use a test script that outlines every single type of message that you would want to send to your clients. Send multiple SMS messages and create various templates via the gateway on trial contact numbers. These five steps can help you begin a Bulk SMS business, you can also look into becoming a Bulk SMS reseller. However, there are already many capable service providers in India.

They give you time to hang up your clothes, do a little sight-seeing, enjoy a few home-cooked dinners. They take you out for scrambled eggs and pancakes in the morning and wave you goodbye from the platform. Short stories, though, can be inhospitable. With their clipped length, they kick you out just when you’re getting used to your cousin’s lumpy futon. But (to belabor this metaphor), sometimes short trips are the best ones — the most memorable. Short stories are like a day trip to Paris. Exhausting, sure. But you still get to see the Eiffel Tower and eat a croissant. (Metaphor... finally... over.) If you don’t read short stories, you could be missing out; some of our greatest writers do their best work with the short story form. Alice Munro, Ann Beattie, and Lorrie Moore all fall into this category. And some short stories made big splashes when they first came out in Vogue or The New Yorker, shocking readers or drawing their attention to an important issue. Years later, they’re still talked about in English classes and book clubs."},{"instruction":"Why is the researcher the instrument in qualitative research?","output":"Qualitative assessments are ALWAYS moving qualitatively. Ever self-critical, ever improving- and hopefully relevant (and not expensively superfluous) towards some end point that theoretically insures purity, potency, which involves consistency and cross-checking via people, premises, processes, products and procedures. EVERYONE involved is a ‘researcher’ to be vigilant towards reasonable improvement through appropriate validation. Well practiced researchers must insure ‘appropriate’ validation procedures as well, referenced to ‘Standard(s)’ as a rule… which is pretty much the ‘cornerstone’ of Scientific Method. In Clinical and Pharmaceutical work, anything performed on the premises that doesn’t have a documented SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), is not to be done. Is it possible for SOP’s to become ‘overkill,… the adoption of procedures that COULD NOT have a direct or indirect impact on ‘quality, or purity or potency? YES - certainly… but there’s no SOP for reviewing THAT… thus such issues officially do not exist."},{"instruction":"What is the scope of forensic science in India?","output":"The word forensic comes from the Latin term forensis, meaning \\"of or before the forum. In modern day it can be termed as “pertaining to court of law.” Forensic science is a science applied to criminals to collect evidence and produce them before court of law. During any crime science certain evidences remain un-noticed even by the experts. In those situation the criminals are found be innocent in the absence of adequate proofs and hence they are set free. Forensic science is really a science that helps to collect certain diminutive evidences for instance blood, semen, sweat and pubic hairs, body hairs or finger prints on door or wooden cart etc. Forensic investigators apply certain tools and techniques to find those finer details to present before court and re-create the whole crime scene. It is indeed a very interesting career and has a lot of explorations. The scope of forensic science study is vast. You can get jobs in various governments & private sectors. The study will improve your skills and knowledge. You also may employ in Forensic Laboratories, Detective Offices, Banks and other Govt. and private agencies.

I was horrible. We would do these graphic design projects in a traditional looking classroom with a bunch of computers. I’d sit there with my digital pen, plugging away, working on my picture. We had one memorable assignment where we were tasked with digitalizing our favorite actor. I chose Tom Hanks and started using my pen to draw him on my computer during class. I’d spy on other art students working on their picture and I knew I was toast. If it were a math class, I’d totally have been cheating off of them. But this was art. Not so simple. The fun part was, “Peer Critique”. Each student, prints and puts his piece of art up on the board, then walks back and sits down. And the entire class critiques the art. All these artsy kids around me were producing super hot versions of actors and actresses. Then dumbass Sean, who shoulda never been in art class, walks up, pins his on the board: This is my Tom Hanks (who looks like an amoeba). Sucking at art was a blessing. But the classes were still really fun. Who doesn’t want to draw pictures? Later, I worked at an ad agency (in a writing role - which I was better suited for.) In writing ads, particularly print ads, you work with designers quite a lot. And you see up close just how miserable they usually are.

According to Garuda Purana 2.49.11, they can enter (so-called possession) non-living objects, insects, birds, animals, people, and devas. In some cases within days after death, they temporarily possess a wild animal, a bird, or an insect (e.g. a butterfly). In this form, they appear to their family members to say goodbye. This however doesn't mean they have peacefully left, rather the opposite.Often they attach themselves to the subtle body of an incarnated being and live off his energy like parasites. They feed on impure substances (all kinds of garbage). They suffer because without a physical body they can't fully satisfy their desires like hunger, thirst, or sexual desire.

There are different ways to monetize a blog, such as display advertising, affiliate marketing, sponsored posts, selling digital or physical products, and offering services. The income potential varies widely depending on the strategy used and the blogger's level of expertise in implementing it.

In this case anyone can read the message they just can’t change it without anyone knowing. the second is the actual encryption, that stops anyone reading the contents of the message. then there’s identification, you know that in order for the certificate to say it’s from company x, the certificate authority had to verify it genuinely was that company requesting it.

Totipotent stem cells have unlimited developmental plasticity; unipotent stem cells are the most limited. A totipotent stem cell [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #GHVhW] is capable of developing into any cell of the human body or any of the extraembryonic structures (placenta, umbilical cord, allantois, or amnion). The initial zygote is a totipotent stem cell, as are those formed by the its early divisions (cleavage). At the morula stage shown here, all of the cells are totipotent. This holds only for the first few days after fertilization.Morula, composed of totipotent stem cells.[LINKED_TEXT: morula | Description & Facts] [URL: https://www.britannica.com/science/morula] A pluripotent stem cell [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #GSpDd] is one that can develop into any cell of the embryonic body, but not into any of the extraembryonic structures. Its developmental plasticity is already limited, although not much. The morula develops into a hollow-ball stage called a blastocyst. This is composed of an outer cell mass (trophoblast) that becomes all the extraembryonic structures, and an inner cell mass (embryoblast) that becomes the embryo (and eventually the fetus and infant). The cells of each of these masses are pluripotent stem cells; the ones of greatest scientific and medical interest are those of the inner cell mass, since they’re the ones that can produce any cell type of the human body itself. These first two stem cell types (totipotent and pluripotent) exist only in the early pre-embryonic stages of development (first 16 days). The remaining two types exist from embryo to fetus to infant and throughout the rest of life. Blastocyst, composed of two groups of pluripotent stem cells.[LINKED_TEXT: https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Blastocyst_Development] [URL: https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Blastocyst_Development] A multipotent stem cell [LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gMzBW] is one that can develop into multiple mature cell types, but not just any type. In the fetus, for example, there are mesenchymal cells that develop into cartilage, bone, blood, connective tissues, and muscle. In the adult, a good example is the hematopoietic stem cell (far left in the figure below) of the red bone marrow, which can develop into red blood cells, any of five kinds of white blood cells, or platelet-producing cells. (Only the white cell lines are shown here.)Leukopoiesis, the development of white blood cells from a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell.K.S.

Two good examples are the spermatogonia of the testes, which can only become sperm, and basal stem cells of the epidermis that can only become keratinocytes. In the leukopoiesis chart above, all cells in the green and yellow zones of the top four rows are unipotent stem cells, each of them capable of becoming only a single white cell type. In the bottom group, the lymphocytic CFU and lymphoblast are multipotent stem cells whereas the three prolymphocyte types are unipotent (with allowance for a slightly debatable point I won’t go into).Cross section of a seminiferous tubule of the testis. All of the labeled cells except Sertoli cells are unipotent stem cells.

Much of the research on those has used embryonic stem cells (ESCs)[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #Zznho] derived from the surplus morulas and blastocysts produced at in vitro fertilization (IVF) fertility clinics—preembryos that are ordinarily discarded by a clinic. Even though this makes good medical use of what would otherwise have been destroyed, it still generated a lot of political and ethical controversy. In 2006, Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #fRFRS] succeeded in using transcription factors and growth factors to manipulate adult stem cells (ASCs) into going backward down their developmental pathway (dedifferentiating) to become pluripotent once again. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #FAqQs][LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #YYnAN] and have opened the door to hopes of regenerating many kinds of desired tissue from adult stem cells without the ethical and political issues of ESC technology. Yamanaka has received many prestigious awards for this work including the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #DAOaA] Producing iPSCs is a slow, tedious, costly process with a low success rate, so we still have a way to go in making this efficient and affordable for regenerative medicine. There are also a lot of patient safety issues to be overcome. (For example, could implanted stem cells produce malignant tumors?) You can’t go out next week or next year, maybe not even in the next 10 or 20 years, to get your adult stem cells reprogrammed to replace ailing heart or brain cells; don’t get overanxious and turn your money over to charlatans who claim they can do that for you. Some patients have been blinded and others have developed spinal tumors from slipshod stem-cell “clinics.” iPSCs are already yielding tremendous advances in laboratory stem-cell science, though. Science and medicine thrive on the determination and creativity to get things like stem-cell therapy done. Many labs around the world are working on it.

The main function of DNS is to translate domain names into IP addresses. When a user enters a web address in the browser, the browser will send a request to the DNS server to obtain the IP address corresponding to the domain name. Only then can the browser connect to the corresponding server through this IP address and load the page content. If the response time of the DNS server is fast, then the user can get the desired IP address and load the web page faster. Therefore, choosing a fast-responsive DNS server, or using caching technology to increase DNS lookup speed, can speed up Internet access. In addition, there is a technology called \\"smart DNS load balancing\\", which can automatically select the fastest DNS server according to the user's location, network environment and other conditions, thereby further improving the access speed. In short, DNS can help speed up Internet access and provide users with a better surfing experience.

Maintain a nutritious diet: Losing general body fat, including face fat, can be accomplished by eating a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains.Drink enough of water to eliminate toxins from your body and to prevent water retention, which can result in facial puffiness.Regular exercise can aid in weight loss and the reduction of facial fat. Concentrate on calorie-burning aerobic exercises like jogging, cycling, and swimming.Exercise your face: Facial exercises can help you tone your facial muscles and get rid of face fat. Try performing neck rolls, jaw clenches, and cheek raises.Limit your intake of salt and sugar because too much of either can result in water retention and facial puffiness.Get adequate sleep: Sleep is a great way to combat stress, which can lead to weight gain and face fat.Avoid processed foods because they frequently have added sugars, bad fats, and high calorie content that can lead to weight gain and face fat. Instead, emphasize nutrient-dense, entire foods.Gum chewing can help you tone facial muscles and reduce fat on your face. Just be sure to select sugar-free gum to prevent consuming too many extra calories and sugar.Massage your face: Facial massage can assist to enhance lymphatic drainage and blood flow, which helps reduce puffiness and even out skin tone. Use a face massage roller or gently circular strokes with your fingers. Just keep in mind that although working for a healthy weight and body composition is vital, so is loving and accepting yourself at whatever size.

If you have fixed mounts (a fixed angle and direction), there is only one day of the year where for a few seconds the solar panels are at the proper angle and direction for maximum solar conversion (10–17%). If you put a long stick in the ground which is straight up and down (plumb) and watch the shadow on the ground on a sunny day, you will find that the shadow moves very quickly across the ground.

Abidal played football professionally for fourteen years, representing his country, France, sixty-seven times and winning nineteen trophies during his career. At his peak, he was one of the world’s best defenders. However, on the 15th of March 2011, at the age of 31, Abidal was diagnosed with a liver tumour. He underwent surgery and at first, it appeared to have been working. He was fit enough to play the Champions League final in May, which his side Barcelona won 3–1 over Manchester United. But that success didn’t last long. Exactly one year after his diagnosis, on the 15th of March 2012, it was announced that Abidal would need a liver transplant. This is Dani Alves. A controversial figure, Alves isn’t a bad footballer himself, having played for seventeen years now (and counting). He’s got a hundred caps for Brazil and thirty-nine senior trophies, making him the most decorated player in football. And yes, you may have noticed from the kit that he also played for Barcelona. Anyway, back to the story (you can probably tell where I’m going with this). Abidal needs a liver transplant at this point, and it doesn’t look great for him. If he doesn’t have a liver, an essential body part, goodness knows how he’s gonna keep playing football. This is looking like the end of his career. But who’s there to step in and save the day? It’s Dani Alves, of course, who offers to donate part of liver. This transplant could end Alves’ career, but if Abidal doesn’t get it, it would end his. You can’t have both. Ultimately, Abidal turned down the offer, instead managing to talk his cousin Gerard into it (would have made for an awkward conversation). In the end, Abidal played on for two more years, moving to play in Monaco and then Greece before retiring. Alves left the biggest team in Spain in 2016 to join the biggest team in Italy, and a year later left them for the biggest team in France. He’s still playing now. Isn’t that incredible? For me, both Abidal and Alves were incredibly selfless in this matter. Alves, after all, would have been sacrificing his career had he undergone the transplant, and Abidal would have done the same had he not. But both of them were willing to put the other over themself. If that’s not selfless, I don’t know what is."},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"Whilst I don’t disagree with the answers below, I find the occasional use of a touch screen on a laptop very useful.

It’s like something to be you. What’s it like? If you think about it, you’ll realize consciousness has the flavor of happiness. You're not yourself when you’re upset. When we take ourselves to be a body, then seek happiness, we accidentally mix up these perspectives. Thinking we are what we look like from the outside is the fundamental error. We are actually what we look like from the inside, which is happiness. This is why we can’t become happy, we can only be it. photo by Marius Venter"},{"instruction":"What is onpage SEO?","output":"On-page SEO, also known as on-site SEO, refers to the practice of optimizing individual web pages to improve their visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of on-page SEO is to make the content and structure of a webpage more attractive and relevant to both users and search engines, with a particular focus on specific target keywords, such as \\"[LINKED_TEXT: SEO services] [URL: https://zaclab.com/seo-services/].\\" When optimizing a webpage for \\"SEO services,\\" several key elements should be considered: 1. Keyword Placement: The target keyword should be strategically placed in the page's title tag, meta description, and URL to signal its relevance to search engines. 2. High-Quality Content: Creating valuable and informative content related to \\"SEO services\\" is essential. The content should be well-written, engaging, and offer unique insights or solutions to users' search queries. 3. Keyword Density: While it's crucial to include the target keyword in the content, overusing it may lead to keyword stuffing, which can harm SEO rankings. A balanced keyword density is preferred, with natural integration throughout the content 4. Heading Tags: Properly formatted heading tags (H1, H2, etc.) help search engines understand the content's structure and hierarchy, making it easier for them to interpret the page's relevance to the target keyword. 5. Internal Linking: Linking to other relevant pages on the website helps search engines navigate and index the site more effectively. It also encourages users to explore related content, improving user experience and engagement. 6. Image Optimization: Images on the page should be optimized with relevant alt text, helping search engines understand the visual content's context and relevance to \\"SEO services.\\" 7. Page Speed: A fast-loading webpage enhances user experience and positively impacts search rankings. Optimize images, enable browser caching, and minimize server response time to improve page speed. 8. Mobile Responsiveness: With mobile users increasing rapidly, ensuring the webpage is mobile-friendly is crucial for a positive user experience and higher rankings on mobile searches. By diligently implementing these on-page SEO practices for \\"SEO services,\\" website owners can increase the likelihood of their webpages ranking higher on SERPs, driving more organic traffic, and ultimately attracting potential clients seeking SEO services.

In this case, n = 10 (since there are 10 terms), a = 1 (since the first term is 1), and l = 10 (since the last term is 10). So we can plug these values into the formula: S = (10/2) x (1 + 10) = 5 x 11 = 55 Therefore, the sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 55."},{"instruction":"Why did India play badly in the semifinal of the T20 World Cup 2022 on 10/11/2022?

Using WhatsApp for your teleconference calls also gives your call participants significant flexibility. Participants can take calls while they are on the go, whether they’re at a coworking space, at a coffee shop or waiting in the airport lounge for their next flight. Your callers can get right into the conference by clicking on the link you sent to their WhatsApp. You will have complete control over the conversation, as you can add people, mute others and share files or receive files.

How would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a black/Asian/native person or attend a business lunch with a black/Asian/native person, because morally a white man should not meet 1 on 1 with a black/Asian/native person? Would you tolerate that in an employee? If not, then why would you tolerate an employee telling you that they refused to meet with any other identifiable subgroup of humanity? A person has no control over what gender they were born as than they do what race they were born into. So if it’s wrong to discriminate against a person because of their race then how is it any less wrong to discriminate against them because of their gender? If a person isn’t allowed to meet with certain customers, clients, colleagues or managers just because of their race or gender then that severely restricts how useful they are to the company. That not only hinders their chance of promotion, the so-called ‘glass ceiling’, it also makes it more difficult for them to keep their jobs or even to get hired in the first place. If you don’t think that’s wrong, that it’s unfair, then I submit that the problem isn’t the female (or black, Asian or native) employee.

VERY roughly, 100F < A < B < C < 145F, but they don’t want to promise / guarantee / suggest that a particular setting on the dial will definitely give you non-scalding water at your fixtures. So set it on the low side - “HOT” or “A” - and use the hot water for a few days. Can you take a comfortable shower? Draw a hot bath? Hand wash dishes comfortably? If so, leave it there, or turn it down half a setting and check again for a few days. Only if you can’t get hot enough water for some task, should you increase it, at most one step at a time. The lower the setting, the safer everyone in the house (and especially children and the elderly) will be from scalds and your water heater will have somewhat lower standby losses (because a 130F tank loses more heat than a 115F tank). The setting below “Hot” (or “Warm on some gas thermostat valves) is a vacation setting and should keep it at a much lower temperature if you’re gone for a long time and want to eliminate standby losses.

The first number (138) represents systolic blood pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats, while the second number (83) represents diastolic blood pressure, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. The American Heart Association defines normal blood pressure as less than 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure between 120-129/less than 80 mmHg is considered elevated, blood pressure between 130-139/80-89 mmHg is considered stage 1 hypertension, and [LINKED_TEXT: blood pressure] [URL: https://rb.gy/bgwc] of 140/90 mmHg or higher is considered stage 2 hypertension.

It is important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and speak with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or if your blood pressure consistently falls in the elevated or hypertensive range. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management, may be recommended to help manage borderline high blood pressure.

At this time, the borophagines likely filled the same niche as modern panthers in North America as large ambush predators, while early hyaenids likely filled the same niche as modern canines (the only extant subfamily of dogs); modern spotted hyenas are persistence pack hunters. It’s likely that the borophagines are extinct because when the Berring Land Bridge opened up, there was a great exchange of biodiversity between the Old World and North America. This is how proboscideans like mastodons, gomphotheres, and later mammoths got to the Americas. This is also how the ancestors of jaguars and cougars got to the Americas. It’s though that when this happened, big cats outcompeted the borophagines, as they were better at taking down the large prey that borophagines hunted. The canines didn’t have any competition in North America, as the only hyaenid that crossed into North America was chasmaporthetes, or the “running hyena.” It only managed to survive there because rather than being a persistence hunter, it avoided competition by being a sprinter, like cheetahs. There are canines in Africa, some of which do compete on some level with spotted hyenas. Some completely avoid competition altogether with hyenas by filling completely different niches, like foxes and jackals, while African Wild Dogs do come into competition with hyenas. However, they don’t go after large prey as often as hyenas, while there is considerable overlap in their diets. They often fend off hyenas using large packs, and are more efficient hunters in terms of success rate; basically, they avoid being outcompeted by just being as competent as them."},{"instruction":"What is the best LMS for online learning?","output":"When it comes to LMS, Moodle is preferred by educationists across the globe.

Really! Or what we call Arabic ones. At first, in the Renaissance, this new invention we call a “clock” often/usually had Roman numerals, but for a bunch of reasons Arabic ones often took over. Those numbers, I repeat, are not English. They are Arabic. That was a real revolution—drop Roman numerals and use the ones from the Middle East. No more I, II, . . . V, VI, etc., but 1, 2, 3, etc. And these came to be used by all European and North and South American, etc. in almost all local languages. Our 1, 2, 3 etc. “Arabic” numbers were imported from the Middle East (and before that much happened much Arabic math had made its way from India). To repeat: our numbers are NOT English. Numbers in much/most of the world derive from the ancient Middle East, and with a push from ancient India. Sudden thought—or do you mean the names for the numbers? Not that much from English either. So next time you count, thank the Arabs and their “Arabic numerals” or the Indians of long ago (Indian Indians, not American “Indians”) or the Romans for many of the names for our numerals. By the way, another HUGE invention by the Arabia was Zero, although that invention, too, was started in India."},{"instruction":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","output":"My country in India.

Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","output":"“What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)? Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?” This is the citation for the Victoria Cross won posthumously in Afghanistan by James Ashworth. Read it and judge for yourself. “Lance Corporal James Thomas Duane Ashworth, Grenadier Guards, 25228593 (killed in action). On the 13th June 2012 the conspicuous gallantry under fire of Lance Corporal Ashworth, a section second-in-command in 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards Reconnaissance Platoon, galvanised his platoon at a pivotal moment and led to the rout of a determined enemy grouping in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province. The two aircraft inserting the Reconnaissance Platoon on an operation to neutralise a dangerous insurgent sniper team, were hit by enemy fire as they came into land. Unflustered, Ashworth – a young and inexperienced noncommissioned officer – raced 300 metres with his fire-team into the heart of the insurgent dominated village. Whilst two insurgents were killed and two sniper rifles recovered in the initial assault, an Afghan Local Police follow-up attack stalled when a patrolman was shot and killed by a fleeing enemy. Called forward to press-on with the attack, Ashworth insisted on moving to the front of his fire team to lead the pursuit. Approaching the entrance to a compound from which enemy machine gun fire raged, he stepped over the body of the dead patrolman, threw a grenade and surged forward. Breaking into the compound Ashworth quickly drove the insurgent back and into an out-building from where he now launched his tenacious last stand. The village was now being pressed on a number of fronts by insurgents desperate to relieve their prized sniper team. The platoon needed to detain or kill the final sniper, who had been pinned down by the lead fire team, and extract as quickly as possible. Ashworth realised that the stalemate needed to be broken, and broken quickly. He identified a low wall that ran parallel to the front of the outbuilding from which the insurgent was firing. Although only knee high, he judged that it would provide him with just enough cover to get sufficiently close to the insurgent to accurately post his final grenade. As he started to crawl behind the wall and towards the enemy, a fierce fire fight broke out just above his prostrate body. Undaunted by the extraordinary danger – a significant portion of his route was covered from view but not from fire – Ashworth grimly continued his painstaking advance. After three minutes of slow crawling under exceptionally fierce automatic fire he had edged forward fifteen metres and was now within five metres of the insurgent’s position. Desperate to ensure that he succeeded in accurately landing the grenade, he then deliberately crawled out from cover into the full view of the enemy to get a better angle for the throw. By now enemy rounds were tearing up the ground mere centimetres from his body, and yet he did not shrink back. Then, as he was about to throw the grenade he was hit by enemy fire and died at the scene. Ashworth’s conspicuous gallantry galvanised his platoon to complete the clearance of the compound. Despite the ferocity of the insurgent’s resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten. His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack. This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.”"},{"instruction":"modern sea warfare, if a destroyer is right above a submarine, is there a chance the submarine will pass undetected?","output":"There is always a chance. A better question is would it be more likely. I am not an ASW expert but I do understand some of the basic principals. Shipborn Sonars are designed to detect targets farther away preferably before they are in range. The inherent hull and screw noise also creates a “blind spot” close in to the ship. This makes it even harder to find an already difficult target like a submarine."},{"instruction":"it true that the vast majority of Americans truly believe that the USA singlehandedly won the Second World War, and that the British Empire and USSR contributed either nothing or just very little to the Allied victory?","output":"No. It’s not true.

Hakeem Olajuwan won two titles, with absolutely NO help. He was the only superstar on the Houston Rockets, and they still won titles. He was 12x all star, 12x all NBA, 9x all defensive, 2x defensive player of the year, 2x NBA Finals MVP. If you paired Olajuwan with Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, he would have probably won six titles himself."},{"instruction":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","output":"I would like to answer this question as it relates in one way to the climate change catastrophe our beautiful planet is facing at the moment. Climate change has no technical solution, it only has a spiritual solution. Veganism is the only permanent solution to the climate change crisis we are facing at the moment.”Meat accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases from food production” per a recent article by The Guardian. Per an article on the UNITED NATIONS website, “Animal-based foods especially red meat, dairy, and farmed shrimp, are generally associated with the highest greenhouse gas emissions”.The same article on the United Nations website also mentions the facts below: Meat production often requires extensive grasslands, which is often created by cutting down trees, releasing carbon dioxide stored in forests.Plant-based foods – such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils – generally use less energy, land, and water, and have lower greenhouse gas intensities than animal-based foods. Trust me when I say it’s not impossible to turn Vegan as it calls for a behavior change in how one consumes food. It’s hard to turn Vegan but not impossible. Trust me, you will feel like a million bucks when you become a vegan.I highly recommend watching the Netflix documentary “The Game changers” which shows interviews with various athletes turning Vegan and the transformational positive effects they noticed in their health and performance after turning Vegan. I was a non-vegetarian for 28 years before I turned Vegan. The reason I became Vegan is because I came to know about the harmful effects of meat and dairy industry on our environment. Kindly read the guardian article below. If you want to hear a spiritual perspective on why one should turn Vegan, there is a climate change activist and spiritual leader named Acharya Prashant in India who explains in great detail why a person who cares about this planet and the future generations of humanity should turn Vegan. I highly recommend checking out his videos on YouTube under his channel named “Acharya Prashant”. Kindly check out his interview with Vegan mountaineer Kuntal Joisher who had climbed Mount Everest.Acharya Prashant also talks about how to deal with various life situations (stress, anxiety, relationship issues, depression and other stressful situations) by explaining in simple words the teachings of major scriptures from all religions in the world and how to apply those teachings in the situations a man or woman faces in his or her life.

It is an abstract concept that can be filled by anybody, anywhere. But you find the Duty Manager in the Duty Managers office. You do a lookup in the directory, a DNS lookup, to find that is, say, floor 2 office 7 - office 2.7. That is an IP address, it tells you where to find the Duty Manager. And when you get to office 2.7, you find a guy called Joe Bloggs, who is the manager on duty at the moment. That is the Mac address, the name of a particular person, a particular piece of hardware. But when Joe goes off duty, somebody else will take on the job. You don’t need to know their name (Mac address), but you do need to know where to find them, office 2.7 (IP address). This is equivalent to changing the network card on the computer. As a remote user, you don’t want to know when someone changes their network card. But you do want to know how to get packets to them. So they will keep the same IP address despite the card being changed. And if the card take out is later plugged in to a new computer, with a totally different function, you don’t want your packets going to it because they went to that card in the old computer. When Joe Blogs gets a different job, you don’t want him getting messages about your problems in the place he no longer works."},{"instruction":"What was your strangest holiday gift that left you shaking your head?","output":"Sawdust"},{"instruction":"w do authors who create a book series manage to publish books and do their everyday jobs while also having to deal with all the stress?","output":"Generally, authors of larger series write full-time.

Now, how does one C-Section change the course of world history? Quite a lot believe it or not. Fittingly it all starts with a Princess. The Princess in question is Princess Royal Victoria, eldest daughter of the more famous Queen Victoria (who reigned 1837 to 1901). Now Victoria the younger has been mostly put to the side in history books in favor of her more famous relatives; particularly her eldest child, Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Victoria married Wilhelm’s father, the crown prince of Germany as part of a political alliance back in the day when wealthy people who owned countries sold off their children to secure peace. Now Wilhelm the 2nd is mostly remembered for his militaristic attitude, his imperialistic designs on turning Germany into an empire and for leading his country into World War 1 (while inadvertently sowing the seeds for World War 2 in the process). Now how does this relate to a C-Section? Let me take you back to January 27th, 1859, when the young Princess Victoria was in the process of a difficult and ponderous labor. Unfortunately for the 17 year old monarch, her baby was coming out the wrong way. The not yet born Prince Wilhelm was a Breech Baby, meaning his body was not positioned with his head pointing down. Babies are supposed to be born head first, with their head and shoulders widening the vaginal tract for easier exit of the rest of their body. A breech baby though has a much harder time and this causes a LOT of complications (Imagine trying to shove a triangular block into a square space. Now imagine its alive.) Nowadays when this happens Doctors on site perform a C-Section where the baby is surgically taken out of the womb. Back in this time period C-sections were practiced, but in this case there were two major issues. Princess Victoria was ROYALTY, so the attending Doctors were beyond hesitant to operate on her, especially given that she was the firstborn daughter of arguably the most powerful person on the planet at that time. One mistake could bring down a monarchy’s worth of wrath.There was NO WAY to perform the C-Section without almost certainly killing either the mother, the baby or BOTH. Remember doctors in this time period don’t wash their hands, don’t know what bacteria are, still believe leeches can cure anything and NO ONE WASHES THEIR HANDS. So, faced with this dilemma, the doctors attending chose another option. They gave Princess Victoria as many painkillers as medically possible without killing her, then they yanked out baby Wilhelm one limb at a time, maneuvering him while he was still inside the womb. It was terribly crude by modern standards, but successful. At least until a few weeks after he had been born and Victoria had recovered. Wilhelm had been crippled. Thanks to the manner of his birth, he was afflicted with Erb’s Palsy, which essentially made his left arm a useless stump of destroyed nerves and atrophied muscles. It’s only recently people have discovered how utterly devastating this was for him. Diagram that gives an idea of the subtle but catastrophic damage Wilhelm suffered. You need to understand the time period. Royals took pity on cripples. They themselves could never be cripples. But Wilhelm was. It was an embarrassment to have it. It’s only very recently that we can understand the type of childhood this little prince endured. It honestly pervades into an almost fictional level of tragedy. It plays out in a story pieced together from countless letters saved by descendants of Wilhelm and his family. Letters written by Wilhelm, his mother and his grandmother. First of all, Princess Victoria was deeply ashamed of her son’s deformity. She was guilty that she had birthed an afflicted child. She confessed in communication with her mother \\"He is really smart for his age...if only he didn't had that unfortunate arm, I would be so proud of him.\\" She is also indicated to have heaped greater affection on her children born after Wilhelm.Wilhelm was subjected to several repeated experiments and quack scientific methods to try and cure his arm. Painful electroshock therapy. Sticking his arm inside the corpse of a freshly killed rabbit every day so as to transfer the animals vitality to him (yes they actually tried this). For a time he even had his fully functioning arm strapped behind his back so as to encourage him to use and strengthen his disabled limb. That last method only served to double his disability. They stopped trying to cure it only when he became a teenager. Can you imagine that for a second? Being reminded every single day by family that some small part of you makes you a failure? Something you have no control over? It doesn’t matter what you accomplish or overcome or that your destined to rule one of the most powerful nations on earth. You’re still an embarrassment. Can you imagine the deep seated insecurities and bubbling rage that would fester inside that child’s mind? Quick side note, you can see this everywhere through out Wilhelm’s life. Every well known photograph of him is positioned in a way that hides his significantly smaller hand. He was deeply ashamed of it given that it was a constant reminder of his inferiority and weakness in the eyes of his family. Wilhelm with his father Notice him holding the white glove makes his arm look bigger? It’s strange to see him holding a pair of gloves and still have one covering the other hand. Wilhelm with his first wife Augusta Viktoria. His right hand entirely covering his left. Wilhelm during his final years after being exiled from Germany. So, combine this insecurity into a man raised in a warlike culture (i.e. the entire German state in the 1800s–1900s), suffuse him with a mindset that extolls an outdated version of manliness, add in a healthy dose of unhappy familial relationships and you have a dangerously unstable monarch with designs on proving his worth to the world. Wilhelm, the Kaiser with one good hand wants to show everyone he is strong and in charge. The great irony here, is that Wilhelm had amazing potential to ensure peace in Europe. He was related to Queen Victoria and by extension was a cousin to almost every noble house in Europe. It was essentially one large, strange family running an entire continent who theoretically should have no reason to fight each other since they were all related. An oft forgotten memory from this time is Wilhelm’s great relationship with his grandmother. His relationship with his own mother was cold for his entire life, but if the Kaiser had any redeeming features, it was that he loved his grandmother. Wilhelm with Victoria. No one remembers how when she was laying on her deathbed, Wilhelm was at her side, holding on with his one good hand. Alongside him was his cousin, King George of England. A group of the worlds mightiest leaders, united in grief. It should have been a time for prosperous new beginnings Instead with Victoria’s death, all the familial ties that had bound Europe together suddenly frayed. Without his grandmother, Wilhelm found himself surrounded by rulers he had once seen as family. Now though? They were rivals. People he should challenge to prove his dominance. No different than the people he had hidden away his deformity from. An insecure mind breeds irrational and foolish decisions. Let me tell you another story from this time, passed down through letters between Wilhelm and his mother written in the 1880s. The contents of these letters are Wilhelm reaching out over and over again to his mother. He describes bizarre dreams where he repeatedly kisses her hands and fights for her attention. He’s trying to express his repressed feelings and inadequacies, attempting to build a relationship with a woman who sees him as a disappointment. One of the last lines he writes to her is “Take me as I am.” His mother never responded to the contents of the letters, instead trying to talk with him about politics and matters of state. Other times she wrote back only after correcting his GRAMMAR. Wilhelm never forgave her for this, and after his father died and he became Kaiser, he did everything in his power to marginalize her. As time went on, Wilhelm became more and more focused on militarization and preparing for war with other nations (which has been proven to be one of the decisive factors that caused WW1). There’s anecdotal evidence to suggest that, as her son ventured down this path, Victoria tried desperately to make him seek amnesty with relatives in England and Russia and promote unity among the descendants of Victoria. Wilhelm ignored her. She died just a few months after mother, utterly alone. And a decade later Europe burned. So, recall as I’ve said. I go back and I make sure Princess Victoria has a successful C-Section (Done think too hard on the how). I ensure that Wilhelm II is never crippled at birth, so he is loved by his parents instead of scorned, allowing him to develop a more healthy and less aggressive mindset, where instead of plotting to make war upon his enemies, he reconciles with family. It would be interesting to see if that’s how it goes. It’s always fun to dream."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","output":"Here are some of the best science fiction novels: 1. \\"Dune\\" by Frank Herbert 2. \\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card 3. \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" by Douglas Adams 4. \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" by Ursula K.

The cook put oil in the very bottom of the wok, the place with less area, drop whatever he wanted to cook into it and when done would push the cooked food up the side of the wok out of the oil and then cook the next ingredient and only at the end of the process would mix all the cooked ingredients.

Both of you.” For my loop-hole finding son: “You KNOW the rules. If you break them, there will be trouble/consequences.” “Do you want the lecture, or do you just want to cut it out?” And the one my teenagers eventually begged/pseudo-threatened/pleaded with me not to say again: “Failure to plan on your part, does not constitute an emergency on my part.” And finally the hardest trick there is to learn. It was doubly hard for me because I am a speech-pathologist and talking is my “thing.” That trick is: STOP TALKING. Give your child short, clear directives, then stop talking. Do not constantly explain yourself. I assure you that your child KNOWS the rules and 95% of the time KNOWS exactly what rule he/she has broken. This works for children starting at age 18–24 months. (I used it today on a 3 year-old language delay boy). I will repeat (because I am an SLP educator and am prone to repeating): Stop talking so much. Give your child brief instructions, then stop talking, stare at him/her, and point in the direction you want the child to go. You will be AMAZED at how well this works. This works for children starting at age 18–24 months. (I used it today on a 3-year-old language-delayed boy). As long as you talk; as long as the child keeps you engaged in a discussion about what you want done, the child is in control.

My favourite line from this book is — Chapter 2 Verse 47 — “You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.” In life we do not have control over the fruits of our actions, we can only have control over our actions but not the fruits. Now let’s understand this suppose there are two guys named “X” and “Y” who have to do the same work in a given period, but the guy “Y” started thinking of the result while doing the work, and he started worrying about his results. On the other hand, the guy “X” just focused on the work or his action without worrying or thinking about his results, he started working with full focus. What do you think who will get the better results in the end? There is no doubt that the guy “X” will get better results because he was working with full focus without worrying about his results. Similarly, if you are not attached to the fruits at the end whatever the result is you will not feel sad or happiness, because you were just focusing on the work, you are neutral. But on the other hand, if you get attached to the results then you start expecting the better results, and if for any reason you are not able to get the desired result in the end there are very high chances that you will get depressed and start feeling sad and doubting yourself. Keep on performing your duties without being attached to the result of your actions. Either you get something or you don’t get anything, you should not worry about it. You should have a neutral behavior. Thanks for reading.

(Source: File Photo) “Navratri” or “Navaratri”, is a synchrony of two words – “nava” (meaning nine) and “ratri” (meaning night). Clubbed together, it translates to nine nights. The festival of Navratri, which spreads over 9 nights and 10 days, is one of the most revered festivals in Hinduism and celebrated during the autumn season. It lays importance on the worship of Goddess Durga or Shakti, which represents the energy of the universe, in her nine different forms. Of the four kinds of Navaratris – Chaitra Navratri, Paush Navratri, Magha Navratri, and Sharad Navratri – celebrated in India throughout the year, Maha Navratri or Sharad Navratri is considered as the most auspicious. According to the Hindu calendar, the festival is celebrated in the month of Ashvin, which typically falls in September and October as per the Gregorian calendar. This year, Navratri will be observed from October 10 to October 18, 2018, and the 10th and last day will be celebrated as Dussehra. Importance and Significance of Navratri When it comes to the importance of Navratri, like every other Indian festival, the core message remains the same – the victory of good over evil – but the stories and the narratives differ. Even across the geography of India, while the eastern and north-eastern states refer to the celebrations as Durga Puja, for the northern and western belt, it is a nine-night festival that is observed to celebrate the victory of Rama over Ravana. It is believed, that Goddess Durga battled with demon Mahishasura and defeated him. To celebrate her victory and Mahishasura’s defeat, the day is marked to worship and honour the Goddess. The first day of the festival, Mahalaya, begins with remembering Goddess Durga. It marks the end of the period of Shradhh or Pitri-Paksha. On the sixth day, the goddess is welcomed into homes of people and pandals. The celebrations continue for the next few days and on the 10th day (Vijayadashami) the idol of the goddess is immersed in water. During these days, people get together, hop across pandals, feast on bhog and offer food to the needy – to celebrate and honour the good in everybody. In North India, the nine-day festival is observed to celebrate the victory of Rama over Ravana. For nine days, Ramlila (the mythological tale of Lord Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana) is enacted on stage, and on the tenth and final day, when Rama ‘kills’ Ravana with his bow, the festival is celebrated by burning effigies of Ravana and his brothers Meghnad and Kumbhakaran. During the festival, people dress up in traditional clothing, observe fasts, and offer prayers. Stage decorations, recitals of stories and the mythological legend, chanting of scriptures, prayers, and dances such as dandiya and garba are performed to keep in tune with the spirit of the festival. Families and friends get together to visit pandals and take part in the celebrations. On the final day, the idol is either immersed in water (in case of Durga Puja) or the effigies are burnt (in case of Dusshera)."},{"instruction":"w do I create a customized WordPress website?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: WordPress.com: Build a Site, Sell Your Stuff, Start a Blog & More] [URL: http://wordpress.com/] vs. [LINKED_TEXT: Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress.org] [URL: http://wordpress.org/] How to Build a WordPress Website Choosing A Hosting Package Setting Up A Domain Installing WordPress Choosing A Theme And Plugins Customize your website.

Every aspect of human life, from ecosystems to economics, is impacted by this multidimensional issue, which crosses international boundaries. To reduce emissions, switch to renewable energy sources, improve sustainability, and strengthen resilience, urgent and concerted action is required.

Those team member perform, they win the bilateral series and then what? These rested players come back at their respective places. Not only this is unfair for those youngsters but also make them insecure. Moreover, the senior players know once they get back, their places are confirmed in the squad, they don't have that feeling that their spot is under contention and hence they might have become complacent. Then there is confused selections. You call Shami who hasn't played a single T20 since 2021 T20 WC. You take Chahal with you but he doesn't get a single game. You take Hooda but plays one game where he didn't even bowl. Harshal Patel doesn't even get a game. So you are playing with 12 people squad. And the last reason is too conservative of an approach in powerplays, even when the wicket is flat. Barring Virat or SKY, batting never looked threatening. And if you look at the matchups. Against Pakistan you narrowly escaped when Virat single handedly won you the game. Against South Africa you lost. Bangladesh too exposed your bowling. The big tests in league phases were Pakistan and South Africa where you almost lost and defeated respectively. Bangladesh too fought hard. 2 convincing wins were against lesser nations. You won't get Zimbabwe or Ireland or PNG in knockouts. You'll face the stronger oppositions. And one such strong opposition exposed and humiliated you.

After you have enough work experience you take the Professional exam, which is another 8 hour examination. When you pass that exam you are then a Professional Engineer ( PE). Now you are ready to begin. To succeed you must pay attention to detail and learn how to solve problems quickly and efficiently. The art of civil engineering is to arrive at a solution with the least cost and best outcomes. My favorite example: When NASA was starting the studies for putting a man on the moon they had to solve the problem of how to make a pen that would write in the zero gravity of space. They spent 50,000. The Russians who were also working on that same problem came across that same issue. They decided to use a pencil.

So I suppose the most important lesson I learned from them is that material success doesn’t guarantee happiness. Life’s too short to live it stressed out chasing after stuff.

They invested heavily in content creation and distribution, securing exclusive deals with studios and producing critically acclaimed original programming. This move allowed them to differentiate themselves from competitors and attract a large subscriber base.Furthermore, Netflix understood the importance of personalization. They leveraged data analytics to analyze viewers' preferences and provide tailored recommendations, enhancing the user experience and increasing engagement. This data-driven approach further solidified their position in the market.Overall, Netflix's shrewd maneuver to transition from DVD rentals to streaming, combined with their focus on content creation and personalization, allowed them to reshape the entertainment landscape and become a dominant player in the industry.

The competitive programming skill is one of those few skills that will set you apart from the competition, add more useful information to your resume, and give you an advantage over other candidates when applying for job placements. The students should be aware that a number of prominent tech giants, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., heavily consider the competitive programming skills of the candidates and even recruit them through several competitive programming contests. What is Competitive Programming? Competitive Programming is an activity that aims to build your skills in the areas of Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms by solving real-world programming problems under certain constraints, such as time constraints, and memory constraints, and complex time & space requirements. Programming has the advantage of Students will get a chance to compete with various brilliant minds to enhance not only their programming skills but also logical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, and time management skills. But some students don’t have the right and effective path to get started with Competitive Programming. We will discuss the ideal strategic approaches which will help you to readily become familiar with competitive programming. Let’s get started:- Learn the Preferred Programming Language The competitive programming market has several languages suitable for programming including C, C++, Java, Python, and many more – however, C++ is the most commonly used language for competitive programming by students due to its faster execution time. Students can easily learn and get command over the targeted programming language by using various standard online resources. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms Data Structures & Algorithms are the fundamentals to start the journey of becoming a Competitive Programmer. Unless students are familiar with Data Structures & Algorithms, they will not be able to come up with an optimal, efficient, and ideal solution to a programming problem. Before solving problems and solving competitive problems, students should familiarize themselves with DSA fundamentals such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, and time and space complexity. This will create a sense of confidence and make it easier to solve a majority of the problems. Start Practicing and Solving Problems After learning the programming language and DSA concepts, it is time to put your knowledge into practice and start solving problems. Students must start solving beginner-level problems first because they will find difficulty in solving even these easy or beginner problems. Despite struggling, keep trying, and don't give up. Start Participating in Coding Challenges or Contests Having practiced adequate programming questions, your competency in competitive programming can now be assessed, validated, or demonstrated by participating in various renowned programming contests. Without a doubt, there can be no better way to become a great competitive programmer than to participate in coding challenges or contests as frequently as possible. LEARN, PRACTICE, AND PARTICIPATE! One of the most important things ignored by students is Consistency. Yes, It’s a continuous process, to master competitive programming – It’s required to keep learning, practicing, and participating. Get out of your comfort zone and expand your limits. As soon as you have mastered basic DSA concepts, move on to advanced DSA or solve problems at a beginner's level. So, Keep working at improving your weaknesses and keep participating by continually improving yourself. Good Luck."},{"instruction":"Can neural networks evolve other neural networks?","output":"Recent paper by DeepMind claims something similar.

I faced multiple challenges along my learning journey, but now, having mastered the subject, and thence having bagged a high-paying Cyber Security Analyst job (US 97,800), fresh out of college at Airbnb, by attaining a CEH v11 certificate and showcasing to the recruiters my skills in Ethical Hacking and Python programming, I believe, I should put an answer to this question so as to make your learning less troublesome than mine. In my learning journey, I came to realize that a vast majority of resources available for learning Ethical Hacking - books, PDF material, are not learner friendly. I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the thought-process required to arrive at the logic behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with the Hacking environment. But, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner. Here, I am sharing the link to the course that helped me master Ethical Hacking, you would find it useful - [LINKED_TEXT: My Preferred Ethical Hacking Learning Resource] [URL: https://allaboutethicalhacking.quora.com/My-Preferred-Ethical-Hacking-Learning-Resource] I would bring to light that in my initial days of learning, I resorted to free video tutorials available online. But, over the time I realized that an issue with learning from them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community, attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Also, one cannot prove one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers due to no provision of obtaining certification for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate. Moreover, in several resources I found that while solving questions, the author applies logic/technique that has not been taught yet. This leads the learner to skip to those sections of the tutorial, where that particular topic is discussed. The concepts taught in those sections in turn apply logic that belongs to another concept discussed in a different section. Often, this is a repetitive cycle.

These facts are so incredible that they may even make you question reality itself. Buckle up and get ready for a wild ride as we explore some of the most mind-blowing facts out there. The Universe is Huge, like really HUGE Did you know that the universe is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter? That's billion, with a B! To put that into perspective, if you were to travel at the speed of light, it would take you 93 billion years to traverse the entire universe. That's mind-bogglingly massive! Your body is a Microorganism Hotel Did you know that your body is home to trillions of microorganisms? In fact, there are more bacteria living in and on your body than there are cells that make up your body. You're basically a walking, talking, microorganism hotel. So next time you think you're alone, remember that you're actually surrounded by millions of tiny friends. A Single Snowflake is Unique Did you know that every snowflake is completely unique? No two snowflakes are exactly alike, and that's because each snowflake forms in its own unique way. So the next time you catch a snowflake on your tongue, take a moment to appreciate its individuality. The Earth is a tiny grain of Sand Did you know that the Earth is just a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things? The Sun alone is 109 times larger than the Earth, and there are over 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone. That's a lot of cosmic real estate. The Tongue has its own set of Print Did you know that just like fingerprints, everyone's tongue has a unique print? This is because the bumps and ridges on your tongue, known as papillae, are arranged in a unique pattern that is specific to you. So the next time you stick your tongue out, know that it's a one-of-a-kind tongue. The Brain is a thinking machine Did you know that your brain can process information at a speed of up to 120 meters per second? That's lightning fast! Your brain is constantly processing information from your senses, making decisions, and carrying out complex tasks without you even realizing it. It's truly a marvel of nature. The biggest living thing on earth is a Fungus Did you know that the largest living organism on Earth is a fungus? The fungus, known as Armillaria ostoyae, covers an area of over 2,200 acres in Oregon. That's larger than 1,600 football fields! So the next time you think about fungi, remember that they're not just little mushrooms growing in your yard. Time Travel is Possible Did you know that time travel is technically possible? According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time can be affected by gravity and motion. This means that if you were to travel at near-light speed, time would slow down for you relative to someone who is not moving. So the next time you're stuck in traffic, just think, you're technically time traveling. The Blue Whale is Huge! Did you know that the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth? The largest recorded blue whale was over 100 feet long and weighed over 200 tons. That's bigger than even the largest dinosaurs that ever lived. Now that's a big animal! The Earth is Flat, just kidding! Did you know that some people believe that the Earth is flat? I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous, right? We have all sorts of scientific evidence that the Earth is round, including satellite images, the curvature of the horizon, and even the fact that ships disappear over the horizon as they sail away. But hey, if you want to believe that the Earth is flat, go ahead and knock yourself out. The World's Deepest Point is in the Ocean Did you know that the world's deepest point is in the ocean? The Mariana Trench, located in the Pacific Ocean, reaches a depth of almost 36,000 feet. That's deeper than the height of Mount Everest! It's amazing to think about all the incredible creatures and ecosystems that exist in this mysterious, dark world. Humans and Dinosaurs Did Not Coexist Did you know that despite what some movies and TV shows may suggest, humans and dinosaurs did not actually coexist? The last dinosaurs died out around 65 million years ago, while the first humans didn't appear until around 2 million years ago. Sorry, Jurassic Park fans, but it's just not possible. The Speed of Light is Insanely Fast Did you know that the speed of light is insanely fast? Light travels at a speed of almost 186,000 miles per second. To put that into perspective, it would take just over 1 second for light to travel from the Earth to the Moon. That's mind-blowingly fast! The World's Oldest Living Organism is a Tree Did you know that the world's oldest living organism is a tree? The Great Basin Bristlecone Pine, located in California, is estimated to be around 5,000 years old. That's older than the pyramids of Egypt! It's amazing to think about all the history and changes that this tree has witnessed throughout its long life."},{"instruction":"w do you remove a household cleaner from your gas tank?","output":"You have to have the tank removed and cleaned out if it was alot of cleaner.

The propaganda was aggressive and censorship extreme but, in hindsight.… Compared with what I experienced in South Africa and read about the USA, Rhodesia was much milder. E.g. I recall being shocked when, shortly after crossing the border into South Africa, I was standing in a queue in a small shop waiting my turn when the white woman behind the counter started shouting at the black customers in front of me telling them to move out of the way so a white man could be served. Mixed marriages and mixed relationships were tolerated from what I recall (I knew at least one); we used to enjoy going down to the notorious Queens hotel in Pioneer Street, Salisbury (a hang out for prostitutes of colour) at night and count all the TJ (Johannesburg) number plates (there were a lot) - mixed relationships were illegal in South Africa so there was a lot of “bloody kaffir” during the day followed by “hello darling” at night from the South African whites. I asked a black guy what he hated most about the Rhodesian discrimination; his greatest lament was the law introduced that didn’t allow aliens (e.g. blacks who originated from Malawi or Mozambique) to live in Salisbury. Although morally wrong, this was intended to protect jobs for locals. Becoming more inclusive examples. 1. Mixed races in private schools emerging. 2. The BSAP (local police) were easing the discrimination on the basis of commissioned (initially reserved for whites) and non-commissioned ranks with the introduction of a new rank “sub-inspector”. Although structured in a way that whites weren’t directly subordinate, the societal respect was there. 3. Call ups into the army going into the bush were completely integrated, we fought shoulder to shoulder with black guys. 4. They were starting to introduce a system called “qualified franchise” where the right to vote was based on qualifications. 5. Commerce and industry were becoming increasing integrated. Possibly becoming more classist than racist. The Ndebele state that preceded Rhodesia practiced extremely brutal discrimination; the Ndebele colonizers were on offshoot Zulu warrior tribe that colonized Zimbabwe in the 1800s. The short lived Ndebele state relegated Mugabe’s ancestors to the lowest class. Mugabe’s ancestors were also relatively recent colonizers only arriving in the 1700s and they also seem to have been brutal; it seems the San were a hunk of the indigenous population so perhaps genocide accompanied that colonization as I haven’t seen any San around. The early years of Mugabe’s rule were extremely brutal with the Gukurahundi massacres where he put paid to Nkomo’s (Ndebele) claim of right to rule. So none of the rulers since 1700 can claim to be saints. The idea of black rule was completely abhorrent - the neighbouring countries Zambia and Mozambique were an absolute mess with completely corrupt inept governments. Kaunda was a patrimonial Kelptocrat - there is a really good Alfred Marshall lecture on how that pans out for an economy - if you want to read it its free, you just need to put Kleptocracy Divide and Rule in your search engine. We expected we would head along the same path - and that definitely panned out with Mugabe. I guess you can appreciate that, although Rhodesia was socially unjust, the concept of developing into an even more inclusive society may not have been too difficult to sell to the whites in society; the concept of black rule wasn’t an attractive option. In 1973 a policeman put this in a nutshell with the story “Gokwe council has autonomy and the black guys in the local government steal the cotton cheques, I arrest the culprit and the next guy steals, and so it goes on; I think my tally is about 2 dozen so far and there has never been an exception. The difference with a national black government is those guys don't get arrested.”"},{"instruction":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","output":"Maa. Do you see her smiling?

That’s less than the backpack I wore in high school. Less than half the weight of the sousaphone I schlepped around on that same shoulder for 4 years. The problem is the shoulder strain. Several parts of your shoulder that bear the weight of the bass just don’t get any muscle over them no matter how well-built your upper body is. The aches from holding your arm out at the end of the neck all night will fade with time as your delts and traps tone back up, but my collarbone on the left side has been broken in two places, and no matter how much I build my pecs, the extra bone growth to repair that break (and the slight misalignment resulting from it being pretty much impossible to immobilize that kind of break) just can’t be padded over with muscle. Throw a seat belt over that, digging skin into healed bone, and hang pretty much any weight on it, and I’m gonna be pretty sore after a night. For that reason, all my basses wear an extra-wide padded strap, and I went that direction for my main “skinny-stringer” (electric guitar) as well, even though that’s a swamp ash Strat that’s well under 10 pounds. Levy’s and Perri’s both make really nice all-leather padded straps, I prefer the Perri’s one I have as the top layer isn’t figured, making the entire strap much more flexible and comfortable. At the time, both were about 50, but that was years back, so both companies have grown a higher opinion of their products and you’ll find similar straps as mine costing about 80 these days. It’s still very much worth it for a gigging musician to invest in player comfort; the less you’re thinking about your sore shoulder, the more into the song and set you are."},{"instruction":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","output":"There are certain things which are not out of my hands because I would rather replace myself from that situation from someone girl because I don’t want to be the victim to her anger and scold at the end which cause me headache in the end."},{"instruction":"Why do we need website usability?","output":"Usability is a necessary condition for a website. If it is difficult to use, it is not clear, or the information is hard to read or doesn’t answer users’ key questions, people choose another one. There are plenty of other websites available, at the least difficulty, people look for another web. The quality of the online relationship with your users and how well your website meets their needs has a direct influence on your bottom line. Nowadays, a business has to have a website. For people to actually use it, you will have to go beyond the traffic-attracting ad campaign. You need to build an accessible, inviting, and useful resource that would stand out among other similar websites. To achieve all that, however, you need to know about some nuances. For instance, the average length of time a user spends browsing a random website is 27 seconds. Not many people look through the pages on the site. That’s why it’s important that your resource is able to grab the user’s attention and make them stay longer, becoming more and more interested in what you have to offer. All in all, you have half a minute to show exactly your website is worth the attention at all. Here you can read about WEBSITE USABILITY CHECKLIST!

China has succeeded in bribing… ahem, influencing with money, many many politicians to subtly change the USA into a Chinese / New World Order vassal state replacing our Founding Father ideology and values with more and more totalitarian, non-tolerant dystopian attributes, with ever-increasing social restrictions pushed by violent groups funded by the sell-outs, like Soros and his puppets. They have no desire for the American people to understand our slide into Communisn/Marxism, so they flame the hysteria of their none-too-bright, emotionally volatile constituents by screaming that the Right’s push to return us to our founding principles and real freedom is “fascism” when it is not and never has been. But, our educational system was a first casualty of this slow coup so the ignorant hysterics have no real point of reference and are just echo chambers for their masters. So, refering to Democrats as Communist or neo-Bolshevik “useful idiots” is quite accurate. The fascism accusations are for deflection and are pure theater and inaccurate. As for “Russian bots” Russia ceased being Communist in 1991: which the Left conveniently ignores, while Russia has actually come out against our enemies and has been trying to warn us… i.e., about the New World Order Socialists and inbred Western elitists who want massive depopulation (mass murder) via contrived epidemics, contrived food shortages, contrived wars, contrived train derailments of toxic substances, contrived water poisoning, contrived farm animal slaughter (mass fires and energy weapons), contrived gas shortages via oil refinery fires, etc., etc., etc. So, the real Communists in the USA serving the Chinese and NWO would love to discredit a potential strong ally against them such as Russia. If we fall to the NWO/Communist China, and it looks like our weapons would be used by them to try to subjugate the rest of the world, like Russia, then Russia would launch supersonic nukes which we have zero defense against.

Okay I want you to design a soldier who can walk/jog 30 kilometers over rough terrain carrying 60 pounds non stop. He must also be able to swim/wade through 10 kilometers of swamp. Also he must be able to climb/scale mountain terrain while remaining inconspicuous. The ability to jump and roll from a vehicle traveling 30 mph as well as the ability to swim 5 miles to shore comes in pretty handy as well. This person needs to be able to deal with this for 18 hours on any given day with minimum rest and minimum required nutrition then do it again the next day.

Some of the commonly used Ayurvedic herbs for diabetes include: Gymnema Sylvestre (Gurmar): It is believed to regulate blood sugar levels by inhibiting glucose absorption and stimulating insulin secretion. Bitter Melon (Karela): It is rich in charantin, which has blood glucose-lowering properties. Fenugreek (Methi): It helps to lower blood glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Cinnamon (Dalchini): It may improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels. Indian Gooseberry (Amla): It may improve glucose metabolism and reduce the risk of complications associated with diabetes. It is important to note that Ayurvedic remedies should not be used as a substitute for conventional medical treatment.

Make sure to dress appropriately for the location and weather. III. Be punctual: Being on time shows that you respect your date's time and value their presence. IV. Be yourself: Don't try to be someone you're not. Be authentic and let your true personality shine through. V. Listen more than you talk: Show interest in your date by actively listening to what they have to say. This will help you connect and create a more enjoyable experience for both of you. VI. Avoid controversial topics: Avoid discussing controversial topics such as politics or religion on your first date. Instead, focus on getting to know each other better and finding common ground. VII. Don't drink too much: Drinking too much alcohol can impair your judgment and inhibit your ability to make a good impression. Stick to one or two drinks and make sure to drink plenty of water. VIII. Be positive: Stay positive and avoid complaining or being negative. Keep the conversation light and upbeat. IX. Have an exit strategy: Have a plan in place in case the date doesn't go as planned. It's always a good idea to have an exit strategy in case you feel uncomfortable or unsafe. X. Follow up: If you enjoyed the date, make sure to follow up and let your date know. It's important to be honest and upfront about your intentions and feelings. Remember, the key to a successful first date is to be yourself, show interest in your date, and have fun!

It is something funny, an entertaining line that is like a mirror since it reflects casual talks from real life. Do you think it would have been fair for Anakin to go to Padme and start flirting like he has years of practise? No, I’d say it is rather realistic and fair decision that they’ve made with this scene, it shows constancy and truthfulness to Anakin’s character. You need to understand the movies and the characters since they are actually brilliantly written, their emotions and how they express them dignify the awesomeness of the prequel trilogy. There is this period : Anakin begun his Jedi training in a very early age, later than some other Jedi usually begin this path but still, very, very young. What matters is what happened during that time period I’ve pointed, it’s actually pretty simple - He had been trained in the Jedi ways and had no time to flirt with girls and therefore no way to gain an experience with dating and stuff, the Jedi do not allow attachments after all. But most importantly, Anakin’s quote isn’t stilted, it is normal and that’s because the Jedi taught him to suppress such emotions, yet when he went to Naboo with Padme he felt the need to express himself, it was like a psychological relief for him, a comfort. That is in-universe, while behind the curtain answer is that this scene is yet another hint and depiction of Anakin’s eventual downfall to the Sith design. It isn’t necessarily one big and substantive turning point for the character but it surely is a moment of comfort and break from the Jedi teachings and emotional suppressions. I don’t think this scene is so hard to fathom. Nothing unnatural and unrealistic about it, he is just expressing how he feels like when someone has something he wants to say to feel better. People seem to deem it like some kind of enigma. It is just a normal line."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","output":"If you are interested in getting started in competitive programming, here are some steps you can take: Learn a programming language: Choose a programming language that you are interested in learning, and start learning the basics.

Regarding Lisbon, though, here are some pointers: What to see and do depends on what you enjoy seeing and doing (sorry about the cliché answer). If you’re a “top 10 sights” kind of person, the popular landmarks are concentrated near Alfama, at the Baixa-Chiado neighborhood, and in the Belém area.

The human eye is not much use for judging distances accurately that far away. The atmosphere is extensively layered and away from the ground is mainly differentiated in large horizontal sheets which have different temperatures and humidities. We can see this readily because some of the layers show themselves when they reach their dewpoint and become visible clouds. I’ve seen countless skies with multiple layers of cirrostratus and altostratus making evident the variation in temperature and humidity that occurs aloft. These variations can occur even in quite close layers. I frequently observe and photograph skies which reveal thin humid layers differentiating themselves from air immediately above and below. These thin layers of air can show themselves as altocumulus lenticularis when forced to rise through their dewpoint by ground features like hills and mountains.

Also, the staying-in-home-all-day part made me think. It made me realize — what is important, what matters to me, and what doesn’t. I had been giving too much attention to the noise, the things in the background that don’t matter. I was forcefully making them matter. Now I got it right. I don’t want to reveal them here, but I’ll say this — sometimes your mind forcefully sweats the small stuff. Re-align fast or you’ll go down the drain. Before this food poisoning juju, I used to get up early just to work on my novel. Sometimes I’d work on short stories, sometimes on poems, sometimes on everything! I was distracted by so many projects, but I did wake up early, and I did do my work. But the food poisoning stuff made me realize — I don’t wake up in the morning just so I could write. I wake up in the morning because I somewhere to go to. As the clock hits 10, there are 10–15 children waiting, for me. They are really nasty kids. They hit each other and pull each other’s hair. They run around like new-born puppies! But they love learning. I teach them because I want to. It’s a real blessing to have an opportunity of imparting knowledge to kids. It’s a real blessing that I get to teach the future of our country. Yes, they are from poor families, but they don’t necessarily have to belong there. I also have some freelance work. It’s not much. Part-time work. I do it on my time. And it’s doesn’t feel like work (most of the time) because it’s writing work. And I love writing! My reason(s) for waking up in the morning is(are) - those kids, the characters in my novel, and freelance work. These wake me up, keep me fresh& sound, and give me the energy to get through the day. On another note, waking up early is work. Tons of willpower. So I am in the process of making a morning routine. My morning routine has only one task — To meditate the 1st thing in the morning. Meditating makes me more focused on — the things I have, what my day is going to look like, where I want to go. Doing it first thing in the morning is the best! Also, it’s a true blessing that I have access to a safe roof, clean water, and fresh food. I know one day it may all go away, snatched from my petite hands — because life isn’t fair.

One colonial country taking from another colonial country is not “cultural appropriation”.

I have ticked more conservative officials in elections than any other. I am also an evangelical Christian. Here is what I think: My American counterparts are idiots. Sorry but you have everything screwed up. Guns: they are never mandated in scripture. Jesus never waged a war. He purposely let the disciples carry a couple of swords just before his arrest between them, not one each. He wasn't going anywhere fully armed. Now don't you find that strange? Any war waged in scripture for a Christian is spiritual so any physical weapon is wrong. Self defense is not wrong per se. Owning a gun is no more wrong than owning a machete to owning a blowtorch or a baseball bat. Everything has a legitimate purpose but for what American conservatives describe it for, it will be a no. Abortion. I don't believe in just abortion. A foetus is a living group of cells certainly but it isnt a fully human person yet and that is the issue. Scripture is almost silent on this. So by this I take that to mean it can be both wrong and right. It depends on occasion. There is a sanctity of life but the foetus should never be precedent over the mother. No mother means no foetus but no foetus does not mean no mother. So under some circumstances I think abortion is acceptable under a grey area meaning it could be right or wrong. That is the mother's choice and perogative and she will ultimately be judged for it After a certain time of self viability I think it would be too late. I know there are Americans who will say this is hypocritical beliefs. I happen to know a bit more biology than average. I know for example the countless problems that can go wrong with living tissues. I happen to know that even sex isn't even strictly a binary determination at a biological level. It isn't just male or female as there are many more things under the hood that complicates but obviously that far deeper discussion for another time. But cellular development isnt linear. Things start off the same in the form of stem cells. At some point you see differentiation of cells and organ development. So to think that life begins at conception is rather dubious. Those cells could develop into a multitude of things or nothing at all. The environment can alter things. And comparing various animal foetuses with a human foetuses you couldn't tell. Fundamentally and biologically we are the same. So personhood is hard to determine other than a legal definition or arbitrary medical time. Doctors believe around 28 weeks is when medical viability has passed. There is no definition in scripture other than God is the source of life. He gives and takes life. But you can even argue the other way. Before conception. What about sperm? So if you masturbate and dump them is that murder too? Eventually it becomes a philosophical madness to for something we have no clear scriptural mandate for when we don't even fully understand life itself. There are plenty of other things we need to fix before we need to fix abortion on the possibility it could be murder. But but but someone will argue that God's creation will be destroyed. Yes but you deny God's sovereignty over all this. If you think that this is destroying a life that God made what do you suppose a gun will do? Or drugs or alcohol or junk food? How many Christians genuinely “honour” their body? Or honour life generally. What about after birth. You would not believe how quick they are to dump them straight after birth. No if you are going to support life before birth then you ought to follow through and support after birth to adulthood and of course no wasted sperm either!! If you cannot agree to that then you are not really pro-life. I believe the Bible when it says homosexuality is a sin before God's eyes. Strictly speaking it is referring to a sexual act between the same sex but all sexual activity outside of marriage is a sin and Christians are not sin free. We will sin just as much as gay people will. It is a fallacy to think we sin less just because we are not gay. We tend to breed a certain arrogance in this domain but that is not to be Christlike like we are commanded to be. When Christ came across “big” sinners in the Bible he did not explode at them and cast judgement of a lightning bolt to smite them. There was no fire and brimstone moments. Instead he just talked and reasoned them to sin no more. He was firm in his challenge yet gentle. They either did or didn't. They made their moral choice. We do well to follow likewise. But that leaves open the right for a same sex marriage to make sexual activity legitimate. Sorry but it does not work that way. God declared that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Husband and wife. Whichever way we chose to define here on earth is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. They can call it a marriage but it is a union. I will go as far as that churches should not be a place to get married or if so, it isn't something as defined by God. It is something else. So I would not ban gay “marriages.” I would call them unions and let them do so. We were all given free will to accept or reject god's word. We are not given a scriptural mandate to meddle in other people's freedom or lorde our thinking over them via coercion or law. That would be fundamentally wrong. As much as I fully believe Christianity is the truth (that you ought to believe it), I totally defend your right to believe otherwise. God gave us that moral choice to make. He did not force me to believe. He made it easy when my eyes were opened but it was totally my choice. Likewise I defend your right to choose. So I wouldn't push to end gay marriage but I wouldn't expect God to honour a gay marriage. If people want to call it so, I'm not going to go to war over it. I'll say my bit and get on with life. We'll do well to all do the same. Jesus did not spend a lot of time on this subject. He had much more to say on other things. The death penalty is wrong. I wouldn't endorse it. The fact that life is precious even if that person is a demon possessed evil maniac. Every human being has hope. Some people have had a hard life. How they behave sometimes had to do with their upbringing. Some people make bad choices on account of their upbringing or lack of it. If there was no moral guidance should they be put to death because they couldn't figure it out on their own. Put it this way, would you teach a child any arithmetic when they failed to add two plus two correctly? Are they so beyond the curriculum that you give up on them. The Christian response is no as well as any educator. So an evil sadistic killer has just as much opportunity to find forgiveness and salvation at some point in their life just as much as you or me. As evil as this sounds, God can forgive even the sins of a Hitler. We shouldn't think we can claim any moral superiority because we are not a sadistic evil killer. No we can't because in God's holiness, almost everything we think is so impure that we offend his holy laws all the time. To him, we are equally as evil as Hitler was, irrespective of how we feel or what commandments we physically break. To go for the death penalty is equivalent to being against pro-life. This is why American conservatives have been rightly labeled as not pro-life but pro-birth."},{"instruction":"What are some dangerous legal drugs?","output":"Most, if not all of them.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"Yes, false surrender, only to then resume fighting the enemy when they make themselves vulnerable is a war crime. But, whether defined as a war crime or not (and the term ‘war crime’ is really a post-World War Two popular phrase, despite the Geneva Conventions being pre-existing), false surrender has always been considered a dirty tactic and generally condemned. I remember, as a young boy, reading lots of ‘Battle’ comic books. One story which I remember vividly was that of a Blenheim squadron in the RAF during the early war, which features the dastardly act of false surrender as a key plot point: During a daylight bombing raid over enemy territory, the Blenheim squadron (coded ‘YD’ on their fuselage) are heavily shot up by German fighters, with a couple of crew bailing out and being taken prisoner on the ground as the battle continues to unfold above them. One bomber, pursued and damaged by two Messerschmitts, suffers engine and hydraulic damage (unbeknownst to the enemy), causing the engines to slow and the undercarriage to drop. Taken as an act of surrender by the German pilots, the two fighters cease their attack, at which point the Blenheim’s engines regain power and the dorsal gunner makes two kills of the ‘escorting’ German fighters as they try to take it in to land as captives. The hero of the story, a captured British pilot, see this happen, as do his German captors, and fears for his life as he thinks the Germans will just summarily execute him in retaliation for such a cowardly act of deceit & treachery. In fact, they don’t; they are furious but remain true to their honour. The main span of the story unfolds as the squadron continues to be the focus of enemy attacks on missions. Even when flying with two or three other squadrons, the German fighters always seem to ignore other planes, going only for those with ‘YD’ markings as an act of vengeance. The story is resolved when the mystery of the ‘false surrender’ is uncovered (once the hero escapes back to Blighty, reporting what he saw) and the matter of honour is addressed in a suitably heroic fashion. Ultimately, however, the YD squadron is disbanded and reformed with different aircraft and new markings to end the hatred. So, that’s a fictional example, but there’s also a rather sneaky and dirty real case of false surrender from the American Civil War which I recall reading of: On the morning of January 31st 1863 two Confederate ironclads steamed out of Charleston harbour to attack the blockading ships of the Union Navy. The CSS Chicora first surprised and badly damaged the USS Mercedita, whose captain surrendered to prevent further losses to his crew. The Rebels paroled the crew of Mercedita, meaning that they had to surrender themselves as soon as they returned to base, taking no further part in military activities until ‘exchanged’ for Confederate prisoners. Mercedita’s captain and crew honourably did this. Coming to the aid of the damaged Federal ship, the USS Keystone State was next to feel the wrath of Chicora’s bow gun, being immobilised. At this point, she ran up a white flag and the Confederate ship stopped firing on her. However, once clear of danger, Keystone State opened fire on Chicora again*, violating the terms of surrender. No further action was taken regarding this, as the action soon drew to an end as the Federals broke off and retired, abandoning their blockade temporarily. Interestingly though, the Union accounts give no mention of Keystone State ‘un-surrendering’, nor did the Union ever acknowledge that the blockade was legally broken. It seems that, among the victor’s whitewash of events, the dishonourable conduct of one of their captains was swept under the carpet. *Detailed in the book ‘Ironclads at War’ by Greene & Massignani."},{"instruction":"Why are HDMI cords so expensive?","output":"HDMI is a licensed standard, manufacturers need to pay to use the standard.

Also manufacturers will attempt to markup the price of 'new' features like 4K cables. It is correct that HDMI 2.x 4K cables cost more but we are talking 8 compared to 5 for the older 1080p cables.

While there's no one-size-fits-all solution, incorporating a combination of healthy habits can lead to sustainable weight loss. Here are some of the best ways to achieve your weight loss goals: Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Fill your plate with lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid extreme diets and instead aim for a sustainable eating plan that you can maintain in the long term.Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes to prevent overeating. Using smaller plates and paying attention to hunger and fullness cues can help you avoid unnecessary calorie intake.Regular Exercise: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Find activities you enjoy to make staying active a pleasure, not a chore.Hydration: Drinking enough water throughout the day can help curb hunger and support your body's metabolic functions. Opt for water over sugary beverages to reduce calorie intake.Sleep Quality: Prioritize sleep as it plays a crucial role in weight management. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support your body's natural repair and regeneration processes.Mindful Eating: Pay attention to what you eat and savor each bite. Avoid distractions like screens while eating, which can lead to overeating by disconnecting you from your body's signals.Healthy Snacking: Choose nutrient-dense snacks like fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Snacking can help keep your metabolism active and prevent overindulgence during main meals.Reduce Processed Foods: Minimize your consumption of processed foods high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial ingredients. These foods can contribute to weight gain and have negative effects on overall health.Set Realistic Goals: Establish achievable and realistic weight loss goals. Celebrate small victories along the way, as these can keep you motivated and focused on your journey.Stay Consistent: Consistency is key to successful weight loss. Rather than seeking rapid results, focus on creating healthy habits that will support you in the long run.Mind-Body Connection: Incorporate stress-reducing practices like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. High stress levels can hinder weight loss progress by increasing cortisol levels.Seek Professional Guidance: If you're struggling with weight loss, consider consulting a registered dietitian, nutritionist, or healthcare professional. They can provide personalized guidance based on your individual needs and goals. Remember, weight loss is not just about the number on the scale, but also about improving your overall health and well-being. Embrace a holistic approach that encompasses dietary changes, physical activity, and positive lifestyle habits to achieve lasting results.

Sushant actually not being there makes it lot more emotional. I bet no matter how strong you claim you are you won't be able to resist yourself from shedding tears, given that you are a human by heart and not just a mind that's governing body for survival in the rat race of life All I can say is the meaning of movie would be completely different if Sushant was alive. I would want you all to take a moment and appreciate all the blessings you have in life, at the end, over money or the materialistic possessions it's some unforgettable moments of happiness with your loved ones that remain with you. If you are blessed enough that you don't need to count your days,then make your days count and live every moment to the fullest. Nothing is eternal so don't miss an opportunity to acknowledge it and submit yourself to the tranquility of present,as it's really a present. Life's too short to crib about the problems, instead embrace it as a part of life which makes little things beautiful and merrier I know these words are consequence of certain emotional state that is bound to change and so is my thought process in accordance with situations I encounter but if given a choice to chose a state of mind I would indeed chose this painful bliss, something that drains you but still can't empty an endless reservoir that's within one. Live for a greater cause and don't remain confined by a mirage that makes you believe that happiness is achieving the best for you,it is only when you realise that life's also about making a profoundly positive impact in the lives of as many as you can and when you realise this from the deepest part of your being,inner peace is showered by the almighty. We are all blessed with certain privilege so whenever possible do use that to complete someone else's incompleteness. We all are flawed in some way or the other but only when we come together with an urge to complete others,our own void will automatically vanish. Peace is in togetherness and harmony.

I am a Brazilian born Japanese living in Romania. My grandparents are Japanese who migrated to Brazil in the beginning of the 20th century. My parents and I were born in Brazil and therefore have Brazilian nationality. So we are Brazilians of Japanese ethnicity. In Brazil and especially in the countryside of Sao Paulo state, Brazilian born Japanese are usually called \\"Japa\\" in a derogatory way and because most of the Japanese in the region work the land, \\"Japa\\" is practically synonym with \\"redneck\\". So even though my family lived in the city and my father was an attorney, I was considered a \\"Japa\\" . So because of my appearance I was never considered Brazilian even though I have Brazilian nationality. When I was 23 years old, I moved to Japan. Even though I look Japanese and after a couple of years living in Japan I spoke Japanese fluently, many Japanese considered me a \\"gaijin\\" (foreigner/outsider) in a derogatory way. Then after 14 years living in Japan, I moved to Romania where, because of my Asian appearance I am considered \\"Chinezu\\" (Chinese). I moved here in 2002, right when the SARS epidemic in China was all over the news. Because of it and because of my appearance, people in the town where I was living in that time (Ploiesti) didn't let me ride public transport or shop in the neighborhood shops. Every time I went out of my apartment I would meet people in the streets who would be hostile to me assuming that I must be a SARS infected Chinese or people who enjoyed mocking me by yelling in mock Chinese or hooting like Bruce Lee. So, in Brazil I was a \\"Japa\\". In Japan I was \\"Gaijin\\". And in Romania I am \\"Chinezu\\".

The principle different in using C++ really is the difference of using a lower-level compiled language versus a higher-level scripting language. You’re going to find resources for most algorithms in most languages. The scripting languages are more convenient running analysese because they can be quickly modified without compiling and really very little concern about the underlying mechanics and types.

Arguably, he thought Islam was “more practical” than Christianity, which he thought “negates life” and is a “religion of pity.” I think that what he meant is that Islam is a “powerful” religion that deals with life in “harshness” rather than the presumed “lovely” nature of the Church (which, in practice, very much was never the case)."},{"instruction":"What is keeping commercial spaceflight from being readily available to the public?","output":"Price. You can (or at least, recently could) go to the Russian company: [LINKED_TEXT: Space Adventures] [URL: http://www.spaceadventures.com/] and pay them tens of millions of dollars - and they’d fly you to the ISS for a 10 day orbital vacation. Around half a dozen people have already done exactly that - and one particularly rich guy did it twice already! So it is already “available” - it’s just a matter of price. Right now it’s costly because space flight is costly. The Russian Soyuz capsule can deliver cargo to orbit for about 20,000 per kilogram. So a human in a spacesuit - with enough food and water for 10 days is probably around 150kg - so the price is going to be AT LEAST 3 million. In practice it’ll be a lot more than that because 20,000 per kg doesn’t include the return trip and all of the training you’d need to be safely able to travel. The actual price charged for a 10 day trip is more like 20,000,000. So - ultimately - the need is to get that 20,000/kg down to a more reasonable number. If SpaceX’s BFR does what they claim - then they’ll cut that 20,000 down to just 75/kg…which suggests that maybe you could get yourself into orbit for 11,250…but probably, additional costs would push that up to 100,000. Still - that’s something that many people could afford. It’s not unprecidented for people to spend one year of salary on a “journey of a lifetime” vacation. So a LOT of people could afford a trip to space. Elon Musk has been talking about sub-orbital flights in the BFR coming down to about the price of a 1st class airfare. So it’s happening, gradually.

This makes them less suitable for use in smaller civil jets, which require lighter and more compact engines.Efficiency: High bypass turbofans are most efficient at high altitudes and high speeds. Smaller civil jets typically operate at lower altitudes and speeds, where other types of jet engines can be more efficient.Noise: High bypass turbofans produce less noise than other types of jet engines, but they are still relatively loud. This can be a concern in residential areas or near airports, where noise pollution is a significant issue. For these reasons, smaller civil jets typically use other types of jet engines, such as turbojets or turbofans with lower bypass ratios, that are better suited to their size, operating conditions, and cost requirements."},{"instruction":"What is the best army strategy for TH10 in COC?","output":"H"},{"instruction":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","output":"Submarines discharge any human waste into the ocean, pumping it out using the pressure of the ocean or with pressurized air."},{"instruction":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","output":"Human Willpower could change perspectives of many and the following quote is apt here: “What is now proved was once only imagined.” - William Blake Take Bodybuilders, Athletes, Entrepreneurs, IAS officers (all UPSC aspirants also) etc. who give a test of willpower every day and their achievements speak for them. For a willpower, one has to forget all the short term gratifications to achieve long terms goals. Courage, mental stamina and determination are required to achieve high willpower. Also, It is proved through various studies and experiments that willpower could be learned and strengthened. Now I will directly jump to the best examples case wise: Bodybuilders Bodybuilding needs consistent efforts to be stronger, workout, lose weight and gain muscles. At any moment of your day or life, commitment to bodybuilding is always required. Bodybuilders track their calories, macros, exercise calendars, sleep records, supplement dosage, doctor visits, and N more things. They compete in different competitions and take several years to reach that level. Take an example of Ronnie Coleman [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #Cgenl](8 times Mr. Olympia). His rise to Bodybuilding was very slow that it took him 6 years to win the first Mr. Olympia title in 1998. Before winning the first Mr. Olympia, his record was as below: 1992 - Not even ranked during Mr. Olympia 1994 - 15th place 1995 - 10th place 1996 - 6th place 1997 - 9th place At the 1998’s Mr. Olympia, he defeated Flex Wheeler and then won 7 more titles consecutively. Now, this looks easy but it is not! It took him more than 4-5 years to even participate in the first Mr. Olympia competition. Think about those number of years when he must have been eating the same diet, doing the same exercises, getting defeated year by year and still maintaining the determination & courage to compete again. Athletes Athletes face defeat often throughout their careers and that drives them to success. Michael Jordan [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #pCmOV] is one of those stars who failed handsomely to become the one. He is referred to as the best basketball player of all time. He mentioned once, I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. He openly says that success was not a slam dunk for him and his first failure was when his name was not considered for the Junior varsity team and that pushed him to try even harder. Failures did not discourage him. During his initial years of growth, he was not considered among those with great talent to be successful in the future.

Even he was considered less creative without any imagination for a job in a newspaper company also. His Mickey Mouse character was rejected by MGM on the basis that women are afraid of mice and who knew that one day, this character would result into an empire which even Walt Disney wouldn’t have imagined.

My husband as well as my sister and brother in law both, being in railways, maximum railway staff knew me personally, which made me troublesome several times in one way or the other. Some even visited our residence instead of the branch for their routine transactions and I was giving them services being a good banker-cum-friend. I brief one of the instances by which I was disgusted with myself for offering so much services. It happened like this. The wife of my husband's friend(say Mrs m) visited the branch for opening a Recurring deposit account. Since she was not having savings bank account , I demanded introduction which she could not give. I myself avoided to sign(as it might be a nuisance as I knew so many personally and every one demand that) so asked her to fetch the signature of my husband. My husband was at lunch break and was at home at that hour, she reached there, fetched the introduction signature and RD account was opened. Every month Mrs M began to reach my home at 9-9.30 asking me to deposit instalment thrushing cash in my hand telling that she didn't get the time to visit the branch.

You are forced to learn about various subjects such as complex math, science that does not help you in adulthood, and tidbits of knowledge about the 1800’s. These things do not help the majority into adulthood, and instead forces students to learn the information to pass, and they soon forget it because this does not interest them. Riddle me this: Why do students have to learn information that will not help them later in life? Why are we forced (to get a decent job!) to know useless things? Students who decide to not learn useless information are punished, Why? Because the school system is broken! High school students in the state of Florida are required to pass the final exam in geometry (as well as Algebra, a freshman course.) What average adult needs to know the formula of a sphere or rectangular prism on a daily, or even yearly basis? Little to none. But every 16 year old is forced to take a class to teach this (this is a mild example, in geometry the students do way more complex formulas/math on a daily basis, all of which is useless to most adults. The last time most adults remember using SOH-CAH-TOA was in high school! The schools teach you to regurgitate information instead of learn it. They give you busy worksheets nailing information into your head instead of giving you the resources to learn it on your own. The part that stings me the most is that while you are busy taking state mandated complex math courses, you aren’t learning practical skills to help you in life. Most new high school graduates (around 18–19) do not know how to pay bills, file taxes, or cook. Can you believe this bullshit? They force you to take a class that warns you of obesity but don’t require you to take a class that teaches you how to cook healthy meals (the food you eat is vital to staying healthy, just as important as working out regularly.) That is fucking unbelievable. In conclusion, I despise the USA’s public school system because it focuses on information regurgitation rather then how to learn, and forces you to take bullshit complex math and science classes rather then teaching you how to be a functioning member of society. *I would like to add that I have learned more from the internet and books on my own then the public school system has taught me through compulsory education. I pass my classes to look good to future employers, not because I consider graduating high school something to be proud of. School should get it’s students excited about learning information, and rather makes the majority to learn to despise it. I believe that school is important, but it should be reformed to teach students to learn how to make it in the real world. I should be excited to go to school and learn something new, and rather has grown to despise it so much that I am making every effort to graduate early just go get out of the hellhole that it is."},{"instruction":"English is an almost grammarless language. — Richard Grant White.

It involves optimizing various elements and factors directly within the webpage to make it more search engine-friendly and relevant to users. On-page SEO focuses on both the content and HTML source code of a page. Here are some key aspects of on-page SEO: 1. Keyword Optimization: Conduct keyword research to identify relevant keywords and phrases that users are likely to search for. Incorporate these keywords naturally into the page's title tag, meta description, headings, subheadings, URL, and within the content itself. However, avoid overstuffing keywords, as it can negatively impact user experience and search rankings. 2. High-Quality and Relevant Content: Create original, engaging, and informative content that satisfies the intent of the user's search query. Ensure that the content is well-structured, easy to read, and provides value to the audience. Use relevant headings, bullet points, and formatting to enhance readability. Including multimedia elements such as images, videos, and infographics can also improve the user experience. 3. Meta Tags: Optimize the meta title and meta description tags to accurately describe the page's content and entice users to click through from search engine results. Keep the title tag concise (around 50-60 characters) and include the primary keyword. The meta description should be compelling, concise (around 150-160 characters), and also contain relevant keywords. 4. URL Structure: Create user-friendly and search engine-friendly URLs that are descriptive and easy to understand. Include relevant keywords in the URL to provide search engines with additional context about the page's content. Avoid using lengthy, complex, or dynamically generated URLs that may confuse users and search engines. 5. Header Tags: Utilize header tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure the content hierarchically and help search engines understand the page's structure and key topics. The H1 tag should typically include the primary keyword and represent the main heading of the page, while subsequent heading tags can be used for subheadings and further organization of content. 6. Image Optimization: Optimize images by using descriptive filenames and alt tags that include relevant keywords. Compress the images to reduce their file size without sacrificing quality, as faster loading times can positively impact user experience and search rankings. Image captions and surrounding textual content can also provide context to search engines. 7. Internal Linking: Incorporate internal links within the content to guide users to other relevant pages on your website. Internal linking helps search engines discover and index pages more efficiently and distributes authority and ranking power across the website. Use descriptive anchor text that includes relevant keywords to provide further context. 8. Mobile-Friendliness: Ensure that the webpage is mobile-friendly and responsive, providing a seamless user experience on various devices. With the increasing number of mobile searches, search engines prioritize mobile-friendly pages in their rankings. Optimize the page layout, font sizes, and touch elements to accommodate smaller screens. 9. Page Loading Speed: Optimize the page's loading speed by minimizing unnecessary code, compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and utilizing content delivery networks (CDNs). A faster loading speed improves user experience and can positively impact search rankings. 10. Schema Markup: Implement schema markup, also known as structured data, to provide search engines with additional information about the content and context of the page. Schema markup helps search engines display rich snippets and enhanced search results, providing more visibility and attracting users' attention. Remember, on-page SEO is an ongoing process, and regular monitoring, analysis, and optimization are necessary to maintain and improve search engine rankings."},{"instruction":"f Thatcher is so hated, why did Sky News Australia say Britain became great under her and said they liked her?","output":"She had to take some hard economic decisions and because of this some people suffered and of course those who suffered hated her"},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"The human body contains enough DNA to stretch from the sun to Pluto and back — 17 times.2.

All such teachings have been well documented by secular and religious references to be rooted in Platonic philosophy and false religions. Of course the Bible does explain the only hope for all humans who have died to live again. This is not compared to “an afterlife” as believed to happen after the moment of death, but it is a general resurrection in what Martha called “the Last Day.” John 11:24 What did Martha mean when she said that Lazarus would rise on “the last day”? Well, Martha had heard about Jesus’ promise: ‘All those in the memorial tombs will come out.’ (John 5:28, 29) So “the last day” is when all those in God’s memory will be brought back to life. This last day is not a 24-hour day. It will be a thousand years long. On this day, the Bible says, ‘God will judge the people of the earth.’ The ones he judges will include those who have been resurrected.—Acts 17:31; 2 Peter 3:8.

In the approximation that the atomic nucleus is a point, then that electric field is discontinuous at the nucleus of any atom. In quantum mechanics, we have the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which says that we cannot know the location of that atomic nucleus exactly. However, we do not need to worry about this on the scale of a PN junction, which is a few atoms thick. Saying that the electric field is discontinuous is a sufficiently accurate approximation."},{"instruction":"w do I make group calls in WhatsApp?","output":"5 Latest WhatsApp Update: What’s New?

I love librarians. They are the smooth asphalt on a writer’s road. A research librarian is worth her or his weight in gold in my humble opinion. I wrote the following a few minutes ago and I offer it only as containing some practical experience gained through more than 30 years of being published and many experiences of soul-searing pain. Do not just start writing text. Write an outline. In older days thesis directors and editors commonly wanted an outline, but not much now (although as to editors it may still be the case for less established writers). I have never completely followed an outline because the actual writing, additional sources, ideas, finding a weakness in reasoning and other events may not appear at first. I write a lot of law-based stuff and between the Supreme Court and Congress, I am never at a loss for needed updates. But an outline gives you a general structure and, in my case, gives me a feeling of being in control. The problem of “what next” is solved in the outline, not four chapters later. That said, don’t feel bound by the outline. A work of writing is every bit as creative as any other artistic endeavor, so expect evolution as the work begins to appear.Hopefully you will not experience the ARRRRRGHHH moment, but if you keep writing it will happen. That is the sound of a writer who just discovered a previously unknown source, someone else’s research, or just has an old-fashioned apotheosis that makes some portion of the work erroneous. It happens. Deal with it honestly. That’s what extensions of deadlines are for. Never, ever compromise on the integrity of your work. P.S. If ARRRRGHHH is followed by further screaming, however, that means an electronic failure. I am so old that my first published work was done on a state-of-the-art Selectric typewriter, when a backup copy could be either carbon paper or photocopying, but computers, hard drives, software, fails. Back up everything to a separate source, preferably a server somewhere else. Pay for the larger storage capacity of one of the major online services. I once lost a 147-page article in the final edit. Now my work is backed up to a remote server every 30 minutes because I don’t get paid more if I have to rewrite.Write some every day. There is a sort of flow to writing and thinking is more difficult to start back up when there is much of an interruption. My late husband told me that, when I was writing, he could discuss something and either just get a vacant look, or no response at all, then an hour or so later, I would answer. To me, it felt as if no time had passed. I suspect that what he said (and we are talking about the finest man to walk the earth) went into a corner of my ROM, where it stayed until there was sufficient free RAM to process it - apparently without a time stamp.Do not drink alcohol. Ever listened to a couple of drunks in a bar? Your thesis can read like they sound, or just never be finished, if you use alcohol as fuel. Eat lighter, healthy food at least once a day. My live-in caregiver is an excellent cook and as a diabetic, is big on fruits and vegetables. She puts down a plate three times a day, so I eat regularly and more healthy than I would left to myself. It does make a different. Drink juice and take vitamins. In the interest of fair disclosure, I should mention that I passed the bar on a diet of popcorn and cokes, so I am speaking here from later experience.Never mistake the first complete draft for the last one. Have your work read by another person, or read it yourself. The last edit by the writer is, for me, where the quality of the work comes together. I have literally thousands of pages in print and I am well past the stage where I think every word is golden, but on the other hand, my work is honest and readable. The embarrassing stuff has long since been edited out — for the most part by me. Never be tempted to send in that awful first go-round just to get the thing off your desk. You will be sorry, I promise.Hiring a service to write for you is, I am aware, something of a growing industry. I have never used such a service. I believe my loyal readers expect that what they read will be my work, not that of someone else. If you write a thesis or dissertation, don’t you think your professor expects that the work presented will be yours? Your professor or director or editor can make suggestions, but in the end it is your name on the page, and as a matter of scholarly integrity, it is your mind that the reader wants to see."},{"instruction":"Which is the best abroad educational consultancy for studying in Germany?","output":"A good educational consultancy is one which counsels a student on all the possible options which are most suitable for them and take care of them until they reach their destination.

Now, I know you may be thinking “well people do that all the time.” And, you’d be right. People run to raise money all the time because of people like Terry. Terry was diagnosed with Ostersarcoma, which is bone cancer. His right leg was amputated, and he thought that it was ridiculous that we hadn’t cured cancer yet. So, at the cost of his own health (and likely his life) he raised nearly 2 million dollars in his run across Canada. He had to stop at Thunder Bay after trekking more than 3,300 miles, and be treated (as the cancer in his body had now spread to his lungs). He could not continue running. Terry Fox died at the age of 22, but today if you are diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, your rate of success is nearly 70 or 80 percent chances of survival[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-remarkable-displays-of-selflessness-witnessed-in-sports] .

Tigers won in 7 and had the last 31 win pitcher Denny McClain. Mickey Lolich a left won 3 games in the 1968 World Series.

Sansa, for example, also smiled when she took out someone who used to brutalize her.","output":"Her reaction to Viserys death isn’t an indication of madness, it’s an indication of her pull toward righteous cruelty. And you are right to make a connection to Sansa because she was also displaying righteous cruelty. Dany’s shown far greater tendency than Sansa along these lines, but they and many other characters show this characteristic and we should see them all in a similar light, to varying degrees of brightness. Back to the notion of “mad” then. It’s not uncommon for a “mad” person to demonstrate righteous cruelty, but that tendency alone doesn’t typically make us think of that label. Joffrey and Ramsay weren’t mad, they were just sadists. What makes Dany “mad” is this attribute in conjunction with her bizarre logic. It’s one thing to kill all of King’s Landing because your goal is to win no matter what, and it’s quite another to call it “mercy” and continue to talk about yourself like a messiah while you do so."},{"instruction":"Where can one find the best biryani in bangalore?","output":"For abolutely awesome lip smacking mutton biryani, go to Sahib Sindh Sultan. https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/sahib-sindh-sultan-koramangala"},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","output":"There are so many great science fiction novels that it's difficult to narrow it down to just a few.

In Sydney, Australia, the only private school even scratching the top of the bunch is called Sydney Grammar. All the other schools that dominate the list are called “selective schools”, which are essentially public schools but they take in gifted/hardworking students instead. They might contain students who might come from more privileged backgrounds, however they are not private schools.

The Gibson Les Paul Standard, the Fender Telecaster, and the Fender Stratocaster are the 3 main contenders. The Les Paul is found in every main genre of electric guitar music; jazz, rock, country, and all their subclasses. The Fender Stratocaster “Strat” has been traditionally more of a rock guitar starting with Buddy Holly, then the Surf-rock groups of the 50s-60s like the Ventures, then going out of style for a bit during the British Invasion but getting a re-birth with the advent of Jimi Hendrix all making extensive use of the guitar’s tremolo/vibrato. The Fender Telecaster “Tele” while being found in various forms of playing, enjoys a reputation as a great country instrument. You would be hard-pressed to find any great country picker who hasn’t used a Telecaster for some part of their career, except for the fingerstyle players like Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed who used acoustic/electrics or just acoustics. In the ‘60, with the British Invasion and groups like The Beach Boys, even studio aces like the guitarists in the Wrecking Crew started using Telecasters. All this being said, each guitar can crossover to any other’s styles. I had a teacher who played for the CBS orchestra and used a Telecaster where I expected to see him with an ES175! Hendrix occasionally used various Gibsons and country players can really use anything. Since the ’80s there has been a new contender on the block, but not around long enough to establish itself as a classic, that being the Paul Reed Smith “PRS”. These are excellent guitars, widely copied, expertly crafted, and hitting every price point. In the years to come it will also be known as a classic in body shape and design.

The potential difference remains the same, no matter how much water you have pumped to a height of 10m but there is more total potential energy if you have more water up there. The height is analogous to the height difference. The charge is similar to the total weight of water up there.

Let me tell you all the differences and information about granite and marble. [LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite]: Granite is a common type of felsic intrusive volcanic rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray, depending on their mineralogy. The word \\"granite\\" comes from the Latin granum, a grain, about the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. People have used granite for thousands of years. It is used as a building matter, a dimension rock, an architectural stone, an embellishing stone, and it has also been used to fabricate a wide variety of products. [LINKED_TEXT: Marble] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble]: Marble is a versatile rock formed when limestone is reduced to high pressure or temperature. In its pure form, marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance, consisting of calcium carbonate. Normally, marble contains other minerals, including quartz, graphite, pyrite, and iron oxides. These minerals can give marble a pink, brown, gray, green, or variegated coloration. While true marble forms from limestone, there is also dolomitic marble, which forms when dolomite experiences change. Now let's discuss the differences between [LINKED_TEXT: marble and granite] [URL: http://www.stonedepotgh.com/]: Durability: Granite is comparatively harder and more durable than marble. Marble is also responsive to fading of color and becoming duller overtime. Unlike the stains which can be removed, a dulled marble has no way of getting its shine back.Resistant to acidic foods: Both natural stones have an acceptable structure but the metamorphic attributes of marble make it more permeable and therefore marble is easily stained from spills especially from liquids that are acidic like fruit juices and wines.Appearance: The appearances of both marble and granite are quite different from each other.Cost: Granite and marble both are to be installed by professionals as the slabs are really heavy. The approximate cost for both marble and granite is 40 to 150 however high-end granite is cheaper than its counterpart marble. It depends upon the quality of the stone.Low maintenance: Sealants are used on both granite and marble to prevent staining and etching. Marble requires sealing much more frequently i.e. twice a year whereas for granite sealing once every two years is sufficient. That's all the differences between granite and marble. I hope you'll like my answer. Thank-You."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy in a real crisis?","output":"1.

Personally one of my favourite dishes to have. Idli is one of the healthiest and most popular South Indian breakfast dishes. It is served with coconut chutney or sambar. Idli has several variations, including Rava idli, which is considered to be much healthier. Pav Bhaji is a very famous dish of Maharashtra. There is an interesting story about its history, during the 1850s when cotton mill workers in the city had to work for long hours and would often miss their meals and remain hungry. So pav bhaji was that easy quick meal that was invented to feed these workers during those times. Personally, one of my favourite dishes if served with onion and cucumber.

Sensitivity. An INFP’s sensitivity is one of their most overlooked strengths. That’s because many people see sensitivity as a weakness. Sensitive people are aware of subtle cues as the moods shift in those around them. INFPs will use this information to help make loved ones comfortable and offer to help or listen when a friend needs a shoulder to sniffle on. Sensitivity gives an INFP access to a heightened sense of instinct, which is handy for keeping them safe, helping them realize when a person or situation may turn potentially harmful. I personally feel that if more people were sensitive and empathic there might be less violence on this world. If a person has felt pain, they wouldn’t wish to inflict that same pain on someone else. Individuality. Not wishing to conform. In many aspects of society, doing what everyone else is doing is considered acceptable. This begins in school, where children are taught how to act based on schedules - when to do what activities and for how long. This basically overwrites their natural personality with ‘the new norm’. (It’s really just early conditioning so they become accustomed to adult work schedules, but that’s another story.) Even as children, we’re taught that being different brings negative attention. The quiet person gets pointed out by the teacher for not taking part in group activities or for not offering to speak like the other kids. Unless the child learns to conform, this sort of bullying may continue throughout the child’s entire school experience - from adults and fellow students alike. I learned at a young age that asking for the reasons behind what we were supposed to do brought me instant dislike from those present. Because everyone knows you must do what you’re told without question. 😕 I was not one of those people. And the more I was not given a satisfactory answer, the more I tended to do or not do it anyway. I had a hard time with performing an action for its own sake. If the answer was “because I said so” or “because you need to”, I was less inclined to do what they wanted. I’m sure you can see, from a potential majority viewpoint, how this genuine behavior might be ridiculed. The people in charge can’t have an individual who thinks for themselves. That might disrupt everything. 😞 Yet INFPs are known for remaining true to themselves, and this truth has probably brought them a great deal of pain. 🥺 So, Sensitivity and Individuality are a few of an INFP’s strengths that some may view as weakness. As a result, we INFPs have needed to adjust our natural selves in order to survive. Either by hiding our beautiful traits to protect ourselves, or remaining genuine and being bullied for it. I acknowledge all of you dearest sensitive and genuine INFPs. I respect and admire you just the way you are. 💗 Thanks for the question. 😊 Related questions-[LINKED_TEXT: What are the disadvantages of being an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-being-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: Why is it so hard for an INFP to open up to people about their true feelings?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-hard-for-an-INFP-to-open-up-to-people-about-their-true-feelings/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: What is an INFP's true self like?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-INFPs-true-self-like-How-do-they-behave-and-come-across-as-at-that-time/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: What are harsh truths about being an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-are-harsh-truths-about-being-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: How can an INFP tell when someone is genuine?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-can-an-INFP-tell-when-someone-is-genuine/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: Why would most people not really want to be an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-would-most-people-not-really-want-to-be-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: What makes it so hard for a Fi dom to show his/her true self to people, specifically INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-makes-it-so-hard-for-a-Fi-dom-to-show-his-her-true-self-to-people-specifically-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: Why is it so stressful to be an INFP?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-stressful-to-be-an-INFP/answer/Kalli-Noble-1][LINKED_TEXT: How does an INFP stop being sensitive?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-does-an-INFP-stop-being-sensitive/answer/Kalli-Noble-1]"},{"instruction":"w is Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ racist?

Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"instruction":"w do I unlock a SIM card on my son's phone?","output":"You can’t “unlock” a SIM card; they are already unlocked for their purpose of connecting to the network vendor that you bough the SIM from.

Take the Tabari people who are yet another ethnic Iranian people who speak the Tabari language. Iran has always been home to many different people and languages. Take for example the Azari people. They are Turkic but due to their closeness to the Iranian people, they are sometimes considered ethnic Iranian people. They speak the Azari language. We can keep going until you understand my point. The ancient Iranian people (e.g., Medes, Pahlav, Parsig) also had their languages. When Kourosh established the Hakahmanesh Empire, he established the first multiethnic Empire in human history. Many people came and went and they brought their language and culture with them. Kourosh allowed people to speak their language, and practice their religion in his new Empire.

Until the ship rolled over and sank in the first heavy weather it met. The designers of the Nelson class had to make some compromises, and that is one they didn’t want.

The techniques for wake induced lucid dreaming and astral projection are identical, and all the same principles apply. There has been no evidence confirming the veracity of literal astral projection (actually leaving one’s body and traveling outside it), while there is plenty of evidence to prove lucid dreaming. If literally leaving one’s body were indeed possible, can we not set up an experiment for it? A person could prove they have the ability to astral travel via remote viewing and then reporting the information they have perceived outside their proximity. If they can get the information right, voila. Until then, I remain skeptical. I’ll also address a common defense of astral projection. People often say that astral projection feels too real to be a dream (“more real than real”), but I think they are underestimating the brain’s ability to create convincing realities. The “reality” you perceive right now is created by your brain. Everything you perceive is the result of your brain interpreting information and thus creating a world inside your head. When you look at your hand, you are not seeing your hand; you are seeing the image your brain creates in response to the photons that reflected from your hand and hit your retinas. So if our brains are constantly rendering an inner world predicated on external “cues”, why can it not create an even more rich and vivid reality without any of the cues?"},{"instruction":"On Yom Kippur the Jews ask for forgiveness from other Jews.

With all this rage and anger why doesn't he thrive on destroying things like DC's Doomsday, instead of wanting to be left alone?","output":"Hulk is an embodiment of rage and where this rage comes from are from different places, now that doesn't mean all Hulk wants is to keep raging out. Hulk feels no one trusts him, that no one understands him and most of his so called friends and people in general see him as a monster when all Hulk wants is for people to see him for him and not some dumb smashing machine, Hulk notices this. You have to understand where hulk is coming from since he came into existence all Hulk has known is war, fight, people are constantly trying to hunt him, to use him as a weapon and sometimes all he wants is just for people to trust him but he's scared of trusting people due to his past experience with people. The rage in him is not something he has control over, it's like for example I create a physical form of one of your emotions be it sadness, happiness it wouldn't have control over it's self and would constantly keep being what it is. In all honesty Hulk is good at heart and he wants to be seen as a hero but instead people see him as a monster. And that's why whenever he finds someone who truly loves him for him and isn't scared of him he can go all out for that person(e.g betty, rick Jones to name a few) for them? He'll absolutely destroy whatever threatened them. Hulk is good at heart he doesn't go out of his way to kill people but people keep coming after him and he just wants peace, that's why especially during the WWH story When Hulk got to sakaar he finally found a place where he felt he belonged, a place where people weren't scared of him, a place where people saw him as a champion. He also found a wife, who loved the Hulk so dearly and saw that there was more to this brute and saw past his physical strength,and am sure we all know how the story went on after she died hulk went back to earth unleashing hell on those who he thought were responsible. So you see Hulk isn't some mindless brute, he has emotions and feels, so most times when you see him saying he wants to be left alone it's due to the struggles he's been through 🏴"},{"instruction":"Does it mean anything if a guy sends you “Hehe” while texting you?","output":"It means he is laughing.

Basketball was more physical back then. Hand checking was also allowed (which was also banned around the same time) and, no doubt about it, so was the “body checking” that went on when guys came into the paint - many of which would be flagrants now and even ejections. Teams ran their offenses through those great centers that were more dominant back then. Power forwards too. It seems to me there was also more movement in the half court games of those “ancient” teams vs guys standing out there on the perimeter ready to hit the 3 like they do now - even centers. So while the 3 point rule added a level of excitement and the rules vs physicality added to the opening up of the game more, these rules also, overall, decreased the battles inside the paint, and dramatically changed the role of the center in the NBA."},{"instruction":"f Kim Jongun is dead, then why aren't they declaring it in the open?","output":"Posted April 29 2020: Because totalitarian regimes usually have to sort out the next leader due to the grip of Power held by Last Despot.

I'm 16 and I smoke about 14 cigs a day so far. If my mom is right, why would I bother to quit?","output":"If you want to find an excuse for your addiction, you always will. And that is being said by a smoker. However, I'm an adult, I'm aware of the risks and I'm responsible for my own health. I don't know what's going on in your life that you feel the need to smoke at such age ( yeah, you feel like an adult but your brain development doesn't agree on that). Why would you bother to quit? To not regret that stupid decisions when you're older and you're addicted. To not waste money on something that only brings you momentary pleasure and relief. You know it's bad for your health but that hardly ever is enough to give anybody the motivation to quit. You must want to stop smoking. The sad point is that even after quitting smoking , your body will need years to get to the point of you having the same odds with many health issues as somebody who's never smoked. If you have the motivation you'll work on that, if you don't, you'll use it as an excuse to keep smoking because now what's the point. I started smoking when I was nearly 18( so the legal age here). I didn't smoke 14 cigs a day back then. Hell, I'm almost 40 and now it's when I do smoke a pac a day. However, I switched to electronic devices and heated tobacco to at least eliminate the many “great “ things that the tar like substances are responsible for. I did quit a number of times in my “career\\" of smoking. It may seem hypocritical of me to advise you to stop but I do smoke as way of coping with s*it phases in my life. It's my last resort to survive to put it frankly. I wish I hadn't learn that it's an option when I was young and rather dealt with problems in a healthy way. And I know I'll quit again once I get my life back on track. You're starting your life so please don't go this path and don't use your reasoning to keep on something that will only bring you troubles and gets much tougher with time. Ps. I don't know how you can afford almost a pac a day when you're 16 and I assume you can't work legally.

There are several terms you should be familiar with when it comes to the Graphite application. Let's start at the top: The Graphite web application is the heartbeat - the place where users can come to create graphs and plot data. This web application allows users to save graph properties and layouts. It's a valuable tool for any organization.Carbon is the storage back-end for Graphite. This is a \\"daemon\\" that gets configured to run on TCP/UDP ports. If there's an increasing load and configure application and sharding, you can even deploy multiple carbon daemons on the same hosts, multiple hosts, or a load-distributed element using carbon relay.Whisper is the database format that Graphite uses to store data. The benefit of Whisper? It allows for higher resolutions (seconds per point) of recent data to degrade down into lower resolutions. This means long-term retention of historical data.StatsD is another element that needs to g talked about alongside Graphite. This node.js application allows for the transmission of data points about networks, servers, and applications. That easily gets made into graphs. That's only just a fraction of the elements and terms that surround Graphite.

Different weapons sound different. Battles are often fought with heavy use of cover and at distances where clear view of the enemy is impossible. So if you know everyone on your side is using M16s and you hear somebody in the bushes ahead shooting an AK-47, you’re likely to just open fire on them sight-unseen. Also, fallen weapons may have been booby-trapped by whoever abandoned them. That said, there are historical instances of it happening, I know of ones as far back as the mediaeval period, and as recent as WWII, In the modern era it generally only happens during protracted operations behind enemy lines or other circumstances where resupply is significantly delayed. It’s very definitely a “last resort” option since the typical soldier doesn’t have as much training with weapons other than his own and you never know what shape somebody else’s weapon is going to be in. After all, something happened that ended up with them being dead, and for all you know it was a weapons malfunction."},{"instruction":"w do you deliver effective communication?","output":"I guess there’s an upside to every downside, so perhaps starting with the good part of the bad news would be the best way."},{"instruction":"What is the most expensive meteorite ever found?","output":"This is the most expensive one up for sale.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","output":"Possibly. But natural gas is delivered via underground lines that tend to be very reliable. While electricity might be underground for a couple of hundred yards to your house, there’s a lot of miles of overhead transmission lines between your house and a generating plant, all of which is very vulnerable to all sorts of outside events. This doesn’t always work out… Natural gas supplies can be interrupted, and in some areas that’s a risk worth considering (especially in earthquake country)…. But if you don’t use natural gas, it means considerably higher cost and generally the pain of maintaining a tank of diesel fuel. Home standby generators running on natural gas are almost always the best value to deal with the most situations at the best price point."},{"instruction":"Was the space shuttle program good, or should NASA have chosen something else?","output":"My opinion is that the Shuttle Program was an unmitigated disaster. The Shuttle was the most costly way to get material into space ever divised.It had more astronaut deaths per flight than any other rocket.Requiring manned flights even for simple satellite launches was pretty stupid.It was supposed to fly once per week - it struggled to fly once per month.It caused NASA to have to pay the Russians crazy inflated prices for sending astronauts and cargo to the ISS. Thereby handing free money to our biggest competitor in space.It limited the growth of the ISS from it’s planned goal of being able to assemble spacecraft in orbit - to a somewhat pointless station with just 3 US astronauts doing experiments in space.It’s successor - the SLS - shows signs of being even MORE expensive and even LESS productive. To be clear - this was NOT NASA’s fault. It was the US government. NASA’s plan (post-Apollo) was to build a 100+ person space station which would be able to build spacecraft in orbit to go to the Moon and Mars…a “Space Factory”. They would continue to use the hugely successful Saturn V for unmanned heavy-lift work - flying huge payloads to the Space Factory.They would design a SMALL re-usable “Space Taxi” to get a few humans to orbit and back as needed. A “lifting body” - something like the very successful (unmanned) military X-37B or the present day DreamChaser.There would be a “Space Tug” - which would remain in space indefinitely - and be able to move payloads around the spaceship factory - and take trips to Lunar orbit and back. So what happened? Congress cancelled the Saturn V - leaving no heavy lift option.So the small “lifting body” space plane now had to be able to do heavy-lift work.Then the space station was down-sized, first to 25 people - then to an international station with 25 people - and then down to 12 people…and it today it typically hosts 6 to 9 people.So the Space-Taxi now had to be an airplane - it had to carry people - and it had to haul cargo - but not much at a time.With no large rocket factory in orbit - no longer could NASA assemble rockets in space.So no more “Space Tug”…and therefore no more trips to the Moon.And the abandonment of the Mars program.Then the US Military wanted in on the action - they started to demand some REALLY ridiculous things of the shuttle - things like launching, deploying a payload into a very specific orbit - and then landing again WITHIN ONE ORBIT. The shuttle’s design was crippled by these kinds of requirements - most of which (including that one) were never even once actually used.The idea to be able to retrieve satellites from orbit, bring them back to Earth for repair and refueling was added - so heavy payloads had to be brought back to Earth. This feature was only rarely used - but it still added layers of pain to the design process. It turned out that the cost of launching a shuttle was so astronomical that it was just cheaper to build a new satellite and pay someone else to launch it.The Shuttle could not remain on orbit for more than about 2 weeks…which made it useless for another huge range of missions.It could only just barely get beyond low earth orbit - so it couldn’t go to the moon or do any geostationary missions as NASA had intended.It was supposed to be reusable - but the cost of re-using it was crazy. The SRB’s were re-used even though it would be cheaper to throw them away and build new ones - just to appease the politicians.The main engines could be reused - but only at most 7 times - and the cost of inspection and refurbishment was almost as high as building new ones…and if the “re-use” requirement had been removed from the design - they would have been much cheaper.The re-entry heat system was hideously expensive - very, very hard to re-use - and resulted in the death of 7 astronauts and came VERY close to killing 7 more. And on and on. The shuttle was the shining example of “Jack of all trades and master of none”. But again - to be 100% clear - these problems were NOT of NASA’s making - their original concept for “post-Apollo” was really very good. But they’re a government agency - and they have to do what they’re told…period. Apollo was only funded because of the Cold War - and once that was settled - the money for Space rapidly diminished. The death of the shuttle and the eventual decision to encourage private space launch companies has turned out to be the best decision ever. The SLS is another disaster - but we’ll get over it. The future lies with half a dozen promising startups (half of whom will likely succeed) - and with SpaceX - and maybe Blue Origin. Removing rocket design from the hands of politicians - and letting NASA concentrate on what it’s truly awesome at (landers, rovers, orbiters and manned spaceflight) is a VERY good thing. NASA shouldn’t be designing semi-trucks to bring cargo to the space center - and they shouldn’t be designing space-truck so haul it to orbit or to the moon either. Once commercial spaceflight takes off - the government MUST NOT attempt to compete with private industry - but instead foster it - make the US be the BEST at commercial spaceflight - earn more taxes from the business they bring in and count that as a success."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"“All the best for your career.

It is a Chinese meal of shareable small bites, mostly buns and dumplings. Dim sum is best for dining in, enjoyed in a restaurant while it’s still hot. To begin you should have a pot of piping hot Chinese tea, refillable hot water; cups of tea serve as palate cleanser. Start by ordering your favourites if you have any. Dim sum classics include steamed dim sum such as har gow, siu mai, tofu skin wrap roll (yuba in Japanese), rice rolls made from rice milk, and char siu bun. Since each dim sum item comes in two’s and or three's, these suggestions would be enough for one person. For fried/baked dim sum dishes, taro dumpling or stir fried radish cake might be interesting options to steamed items. Most dim sum fillings are made from a mix of seasoned meat: minced/ground pork, or chicken, shrimp, fish paste, and a bit of vegetable. Wrappers are made from wheat or rice flour, and tofu skin. Glutinous rice dim sum dishes are rather filling. The sticky rice dough is used to wrap fried dumpling or the typical lotus leaf wrap rice stuffed with a little meat and Chinese sausage. One of the nicest things about a dim sum meal is the dessert. You can eat it anytime during the meal. Translated literally, dim sum means “touch the heart,” a poetic reference to dim sum as a light meal of snacks, not a full course dinner (though you’ll likely fill up quickly if you order enough from the menu)."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between a newspaper and newsletter?","output":"A newspaper covers general news not confined to one subject.

A: Credit to my brilliant wife, who originally came up with this idea… Our three kids used to fight bed time, doing anything and everything to stay up later. I worked long hours (independent consultant with a very demanding client) and by “bed time” we had pretty well had it… My wife came up with the brilliant idea that all three kids would go to bed at the same time every night, but they would be allowed to read in bed for a while before “lights out.” The older kids got a longer reading period than the youngest, so it was perceived as fair by all. At first, one of us would make the rounds at the various “lights out” times, making sure they turned off their reading lights and went to sleep. But pretty quickly, we began to “forget” to check on them, and they would avidly read in bed until they actually got sleepy on their own. For years, they thought they were “getting over” on us with their “extra reading time.” Ha! We were the ones getting over on them! Not only were we getting some shared peace and quiet at the end of the day, but the kids were developing a love for reading that persists to this day!

They see life as a wolf v sheep kind of thing, a power play. (Many of them watched abuse growing up and decided they’d rather be the wolf than the sheep) We don’t. We see hierarchies but take each person as they come. They absolutely and can never be the sheep. This is their driving motive. Since you are a close relationship, you represent opportunity and a point of concern for them. The opportunity is to rule over another human, for the good of the universe, of course. The concern, you have a 50/50 chance of becoming the wolf. So they must be the wolf, for the good of the universe of course, and keep you as a sheep. Problem is that wolves eat sheep for dinner, the unfortunate side effect of single handedly keeping the universe in balance. When you tell them how you feel, its about the same as a sheep going “baa, baa” to a wolf. There’s a lot of play, fun and power in this. Think of a cat with a trapped mouse.

When I found it I was amazed. What could it be?? A sport ball?? A old monk worship sphere?? Or an alien egg?? Whatever it is it's weird. I've brought it to historians, local beach gurus, shrimp boat people and everyone has their different thoughts. Definitely one of the weirdest things I've found. Edit: people have been asking some questions about the ball so here's some answers. I first talked to the old Fort clinch historian. The all got their look and feel for the object and all said different things. The most brought up possible answer is a cannon ball. The problem with that is a cannon ball will have a seam set around it and is made from iron. This object has no seam line sadly and isn't made from iron. It's not metallic. The next possible answer is if it's a rock that's been man smoothed. Like the dragons blood jasper Rock or a sodalite ball. (Sodalite ball) The weight is right at 2 pounds and the diameter is 3 inches. I did the volume and all other calculations a little back i just have to find a paper work and once I do I'll post it. Next possible answer is bocce ball. Bocce is a fancy game that you play with round balls like the one I found the only problem to that is that this doesn't feel like one.

Dropshipping is a business model based on reselling goods by sending them directly to customers from suppliers (be it wholesalers or manufacturers). Sounds a bit confusing, but it’s simple. In the standard model, you have to buy all those goods beforehand and place them in a warehouse. Only then you can start selling them as a retailer. However, in dropshipping, you start selling without actually having any products in the warehouse. In fact, you don’t even have a warehouse because you don’t need it! You promote the goods online through a dropshipping website where you provide potential customers with all the necessary information. It includes product images, descriptions, prices, delivery time and methods, etc. When a customer places an order, you contact your supplier, buy the given product, and ask the partner to send the item to your client. So, there’s no risk of stocking up on goods that will eventually not sell. You only order products after somebody buys from you. And you don’t have to take care of the shipment.

Niche analysis [LINKED_TEXT: Choosing a proper niche] [URL: https://alidropship.com/how-to-find-a-niche-market-for-dropshipping-store/] is one of the most important steps to setting up an online store and start selling products online. When picking up a broad and popular niche, one usually has to face serious competition. In this situation, one has few chances to beat other online stores. On the other hand, a narrow niche will attract too few customers. Your best choice is to find the happy medium with enough customers and moderate competition. At the same time, even a potentially profitable niche doesn’t guarantee success unless it’s something you enjoy. You will have to run the store, promote it, and talk to customers a lot. So, it’s highly important to understand the target audience, to know the subject, and to enjoy what you’re doing. From this perspective, passion is the key to success. If you don’t have anything in mind, AliDropship’s team will help you identify the best options.

Professional web design Are you good at drawing, picking up and mixing colours? If not, then how about asking professionals for help? Web design is very important if you want to make a successful online store. You could compare a website to a brick-and-mortar store. When people visit a site, the first thing they see is the colors on the homepage, the logo, the background, etc. Just like when you enter a shop for the first time. Those who don’t like what they see are likely to leave right away. That’s why you want a professional design — and that’s exactly what you get when you order a custom online store! Technical matters Aside from all these artistic issues, you also have to deal with a number of purely technical matters when creating your own dropshipping website. AliDropship’s team will take care of such tasks as mail service setup, Google Analytics integration, currency set up, etc. First of all, we install PayPal and a number of the most popular payment gateways on your site such as 2Checkout, Stripe, PayU, and others depending on your country of residence and where you’re going to dropship goods to.

We need more rats like we need another hole in the head. So let it go."},{"instruction":"What does an IITian's resume look like?","output":"All the best resumes in the world have some basic rules that one must follow. However, to stand out to employers, they should be unique in their own way. Here are certain basic points you can use as a reference while drafting the best IIT resume. 1. Categorisation A best IIT resume must have key qualifications and competencies categorised well into sections. Headlines may be like academic qualifications, scholastic achievements, internship and research projects, technical skills, work experience, extracurricular etc. Do not overload your resume by accommodating more information. Know that simple things gain more attention. So, format your resume accordingly. 2. Length of a resume It is okay if your resume is somewhat lengthy. Keeping things simple has nothing to do with having a 3-page resume. Just make sure that you do not describe a particular topic too much. If you have more experience working as an IITian or many essential skills that you cannot skip, then it is better to mention those points. The ideal number of pages of a resume should not exceed 2 pages but again, it varies from individual to individual. 3. Strategy to hide weak areas It is quite acceptable that you may have certain weak points in your resume. Disguising them is your task. You must present your resume in such a manner that only highlights your expertise and draws less attention to your weak spaces. Let's say, you have a poor GPA in a particular educational qualification, you can leave that part and instead display your activities, papers, awards etc. Alternatively, you can talk about your major GPA that may get the interviewer to overlook other minor GPAs. 4. Use some colours Using some colours like green or blue to get the headlines noticeable is one criterion of a good resume. This same rule also applies to IITians. Since there may be a lot of qualifications, achievements and awards, it becomes necessary to look out for ways that can grab attention. Using colours and different fonts will certainly make the resume appealing. However, do not use too many colours as you don't want to create a rainbow out of a resume. Other than white for the background, the secondary colour should be black and for emphasis, you can use blue or green. Also, use bold fonts where needed. Italics are also fine to break away from the monotonous font that is generally used. 5. Other interests You may choose to add to the \\"Other interests\\" section of your resume where you will be highlighting your hobbies or other recreational activities. Although it is a norm to include this section at the end of the resume, it is not the least that you can mention. This part helps connect with your recruiter on a personal level. Besides, your hobbies will be highly regarded if they coincide with promoting awareness and welfare like recycling items or working for animal rights etc. Apart from analytical traits, you can also show your creative abilities like painting, story writing etc through the \\"other interests\\" section. I hope this answer helps you in drafting the best resume as an IITian. Keep your fingers crossed as your interviewer might hire you based on the fact that your resume crafting skills are extraordinary."},{"instruction":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Which and in what way? Drew M. listed links to research sources which would seem to indicate in terms of some academic parameters, they’re pretty equivalent. Of course, not all public schools are created equal, nor are privates; on Quora alone you’ll find harrowing anecdotal tales of both that may leave you afraid to send your kid to one of those…and other tales portrayed either as the clearly superior choice. I think the classic comparison people have in mind is this scenario: 1.) A good private school with high average ACT/SAT scores, accessible to middle class families willing to sacrifice (not a high end upper class school). 2.) A mediocre or lackluster public school (not an impoverished inner city nightmare or in a very affluent suburban neighborhood). 3.) Your kid has an I.Q. somewhere in the 110 - 130 range, has the potential to attend a decent state college productively, and you’d like the kid to at least get a bachelor degree (or at a dead minimum graduate high school and be fluent at reading). Many families asking this question view schools as college-prep., I think. In light of Drew M.’s links, is the family sending their kid to the private school wasting 6 grand (or whatever) per year for nothing?

It’s noted one decision may be very important. In a nutshell, researchers found out neighborhood matters! Some are much more advantageous than others. It notes a home’s location accounts for a significant fraction of the total effect of that home, gave an estimate that 25% (maybe more) of the overall effects of a parent are drive by where he/she raises their child, and 3 big predictors for a neighborhood to increase a child’s success are % households with 2 parents, % residents who are college grad.s, and % of residents who return census forms. “[LINKED_TEXT: A different study] [URL: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24062/w24062.pdf] that Chetty co-authored found that girls who move to areas with lots of female patent holders in a specific field are far more likely to grow up to earn patents in that same field.

How many tragic stories of wasted lives start with ‘He/she fell in with a bad (or the wrong) crowd and…’ So a specific private school may be much better than a specific public school for a particular kid. I’ve yet to see a school named ‘Average High.’ If your local public school is quite good, and you don’t value religious incorporation in the school environment (or at least won’t pay much for it), you may not see much added value. If the public school(s) you have access to is mediocre or worse, check out the private options! Note: There are a range of special interest counter arguments. Family/student have religious differences with a religious school, LGBT student with a religious school deeming their lifestyle sinful, people who put a lot of value on more extensive sports offerings, etc…"},{"instruction":"What food is just impossible to eat in a civilized manner?","output":"In my humble opinion, all nutritious food can be eaten in a rational, comfortable and sufficiently advanced way ie ‘civilised manner’.

No conservatives are interested in bailing out corporations, and in almost every case when it happens it is liberals who push it and benefit from it. The majority of big pharma, banks, and most other companies who have received federal bailouts have been heavy Democratic donors. You might find some RINOs that support corporate bailouts, they are not conservatives. Bailouts for anyone is not a conservative concept, not for big businesses, not for freeloading students. And keep in mind, most of the people who are eligible for the student loan benefits are white, upper middle-class democrats. Do your homework, Most poor minorities never make it to colleges and those who do dominate local and 2-year colleges. Those who rise past that to better universities are often there with heavy subsidies. Just like most lies from the left, almost everything they do in the name of the poor and minorities never is, they are always the ones hurt most by Democrats whom they continue to support and elect."},{"instruction":"My therapist told me that I have to form a healthy relationship with myself before I can love others in a healthy manner?

Thick plastic also costs money. As does metal and making such into the right shapes. A ‘gaming grade’ object is often, but not always, a bit tougher than an office grade object, as such are at times expected to see heavy use by someone with a lot of adrenaline flowing. A keyboard is, at a basic level, just a housing for a bunch of switches. It can have lights or not. The housing, quality of switches and how durable the entire bit is, is a direct relationship value to how much it costs to make it, to a point. That point is somewhere around 100 typically for a good long lasting board. By long lasting, well. 8 hours a day, every day for multiple years. Coder and writer boards are about the same, or even more expensive. This isn’t for occasional use, this is a constantly in use every day object often seeing more attention than ones shoes. Which also run about that much for a good pair which is able to sustain use for more than a short time period of intensity. Expensive is relative. What’s being comfortable worth? What’s not having to relearn a new keyboard or get a new one as the old one breaks, worth? How much one uses ones tools, often determines how much one is willing to pay out for such. And gamers have it easy compared to mechanics in that regard. ^_^"},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"After years of hard work, writing up a PhD can frequently occur in a flurry of activity in the final few months of your degree studies.

Local and foreign financial institutions own 22 trillion dollars in the form of treasury bonds and similar securities that are liquid assets and can be turned back into cash by selling the bonds in the secondary markets or redeemed for cash plus interest by the FED/Treasury upon maturity of the bond. Who does the US government have to repay when others already own these assets? US government deficits have been financed through currency issuance by the FED at no effective cost or interest expense. There is no US government debt but the states certainly do have debts. It has been this way since 1971 when Richard Nixon unpegged the US dollar from gold and it became a free floating fiat currency. The fact that treasury bonds are sold on a one to one basis corresponding to any federal deficits gives the illusion that bonds fund deficits but this has not been the case since 1971. Bond sales are actually used to remove excess reserves from the US banking system so as to maintain the target interest rate during overnight interbank lending but even here better alternatives exist for example maintaining a policy of a zero interest rate on bank reserves. Bond sales are currently part of monetary policy (interest rate control) and not fiscal policy as the sale of bonds in no way increases the spending capacity of the federal government. The fear campaigns about US government deficits and the federal debt are based on falsehoods and are used by corporate and commercial banking interests to convince politicians and citizens that government austerity must be imposed and to maintain a large pool of unemployed to help drive down labour costs. The reality is that optimal fiscal policy occurs when deficits are sufficient that the private and government sectors are able to deliver full employment. Deficits are nearly always necessary to achieve full employment but if ongoing inflation was trending above a target rate of 2% for example and shrinking the deficit was not sufficient to reduce inflation then a federal government surplus may then be necessary.

Circular accelerators are useful in that you can re-use the circular track to build up proton velocities over a much longer distance than a single straight track. In order to use a circular accelerator in this way, you need to have magnets exerting a magnetic field on the accelerator ring. Charged particles bend when moving through a magnetic field (the Lorentz Force), and equating the Lorentz force to the centripetal force on an object moving in a circular path will give you the numbers and variable relationships necessary to produce a stable orbit: F = qvB = mv^2 / r There is no fundamental radius that an accelerator must have in order to be successful, but the choice of radius does affect how strong your magnets must be. Stronger and stronger magnets are required to constrain higher and higher velocity particles to the same radius. The choice of circular accelerator radius then becomes an engineering problem - is it easier to create more powerful magnets along the whole ring, or is it easier to build a larger ring? Building a whole new accelerator from scratch is very time- and labour-intensive, and a big commitment for any scientific collaboration. Once an accelerator is built it typically undergoes many magnet, geometry, and detector upgrades over a long time period to create as much value as possible from its initial investment."},{"instruction":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","output":"Great A2A. Well let\`s just be real.. for starters.. this photo will live on forever. Damn. That is some humiliating shit. So to break it down real quick for you and everyone else, this is why Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars last year. Will hit Chris because he was going through alot in his life at that point. The constant humiliation he has endured from his wife Jada [LINKED_TEXT: Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith confirm her relationship with August Alsina on 'Red Table Talk'The actress said she began a relationship with Alsina while separated from her husband Will Smith, who joined her for Friday's episode of the show.https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smith-confirm-her-entanglement-singer-august-n1233580] [URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jada-pinkett-smith-will-smith-confirm-her-entanglement-singer-august-n1233580]( Trash TV at it\`s finest ladies and gentleman ) The times he felt he was a coward as a kid from when he saw his mother get beat by his father and did not do anything to help, not to mention how he felt he could never match up to Tupac, [LINKED_TEXT: Will Smith says the way Jada Pinkett Smith 'loved' Tupac 'rendered me incapable of being friends with him'In his new memoir released on Tuesday, Smith said that the late rapper was \\"fearless\\" and triggered his own perception of himself as a \\"coward.\\"https://www.insider.com/will-smith-memoir-incapable-befriending-tupac-jada-pinkett-smith-love-2021-11] [URL: https://www.insider.com/will-smith-memoir-incapable-befriending-tupac-jada-pinkett-smith-love-2021-11]plus all the constant humiliation with jokes/ memes he endured over the prior two years, all of his emotions just came out in a silly ass stupid way. Not only did it show that he goes for easy targets since he picked out Chris because Chris has always said he is not a fighter. Because think about it, he damn sure did not slap 50 Cent for all the crap he was popping. Another thing is that it just showed me that I just seen an icon in pop culture have a breakdown like the rest of us. It does not excuse what Will did. Like Chris said “ That was some bitch ass shit. “ But I understand. He was just tired of the crap and went at someone he knew he could pick on. Plain and simple. I will still be a fan of Will. I think he is a good guy. Just made a horrible mistake. And he is paying the price for it. I think he should take a long look at who he is married too. Because even though I don\`t need to speculate on other\`s personal affairs, you can see Jada is toxic and is the one pulling Will Smith\`s strings. But he is a grown man. He has to do what is right for him. I know what I would do. Leave. Lol. Take this as a wise life lesson fellas: Don\`t ever fight for anyone that does not respect you. Real talk. Yes stick up for your women when she is loyal, kind, strong, and has your back. Those are the women you fight for. Not a person that disrespects you at every chance they get. Why show them respect when they don\`t bother doing the same to you? Exactly. Plus think about this: How do you slap a man for a joke you laughed at? Yeah. Bitch ass shit. And to close out on Chris… Chris.. you are a solid good man. Takes alot of strength to handle that. It does. But… You gotta learn to stand up for yourself my man. I went through this shit too. I\`m no tough guy by any stretch, but until I started fighting back and sticking up for myself more in life, I saw exactly why people did not show me respect. You are not desirable to even be around when you carry yourself that weak. You can not expect women to want to date you and look at you as a “ strong man “ when you are letting another cat bitch slap you in public. You lose respect from people instantly. It not only hurts you. It hurts your love ones, your kids lose respect for you, and all the hard work you have done in your life for 30 plus years is now just remembered as “ the guy that took a slap from Will Smith “ So believe me, even though Will has gone through alot of backlash, Chris is the one that still got hit and embarrassed. Think about it. It\`s been a year since that happened. And it is still shown alot. You can even see his own peers laughing at it. Damn that has to sting. Especially when you are supposed friends with these people. I know how comedians are. They are going to joke. But do you want to be the punchline to every joke? I don\`t think so. And another thing: It will never go away. Chris will always have to live with that humiliation forever. Might sound harsh but it will be hard to get jobs as a actor like he did in “ Fargo “ playing a gangster. How can you play a gangster when everyone see\`s you get treated like that? You will not be able to sell that illusion. And dating? Shit… woman can be brutal. You think a women would not pop their mouth if Chris raised his voice at them after seeing that? Probably say some shit about getting Will to slap him again. Cruel world. But that is how it is. Hopefully Chris does what I did. Destroy all that weak shit inside you. Find that inner strength you always had. And rebuild yourself from the ground up. Takes time. But its possible. And I have faith in Chris. I\`m rooting for him hard. I hate bullies. I really do. Went through that myself. So I always root for the underdog. So I was happy to see Chris get some payback in “ Selective Outrage “ Nice start to redeem himself. ( Was too nice but it is start ) In closing, that is why this incident happened. Will saw a chance to hit someone that would not fight back. And Chris was that person. So Will obviously needs to learn how to control himself better and not be manipulative. Stop picking easy targets as well to lash out at. And Chris has to learn to stand up for himself. Plain and simple. Safe to say this.. this will be a incident that is in pop culture now. I know Chris got 20 million for “ Selective Outrage “ But was the money worth going through this Chris? I don\`t think so. So not only does Will have some inner soul searching to do, Chris does as well too. And that is real shit. Thanks for reading. Take care. Peace. O.J.

Honestly, it feels great to be on the other side of the question. Well, you asked for “the best advice”. Ideally, I should stick to a single piece of advice. So, I shortlisted some of the things I wanted to say to my younger self if it’d have been possible and ranked them in order of my importance. But I ended up with two in the first position, and I cannot distinguish which one will be the best. Now, I won’t talk about revising notes regularly, putting consistent effort, etc. I believe if you are a JEE aspirant, you already know these. I think the question you should be asking (or have asked) is, “Why should I put so much effort, so many sacrifices for two long years to get into IIT? Is it worth it?” That brings me to my first piece of advice. Why IIT? What is the point of all this? The usual perception about IIT is that you will earn a lot when you graduate from there. You probably would have heard it from literally everybody. Sure, it gives you a headstart in your career, but it is much more than that. I think the most important thing IIT provides is the exposure to different disciplines. It offers you an opportunity to explore and find your interest. The professors you get to interact with, most of them are exemplary. Some of the connections you will make there will be life-long and helpful throughout your career. IIT gives you credibility. Wherever and whatever you say will be taken seriously by default. Add to that an amazing set of talented students and a competitive environment. Every student there is talented in some aspect or the other. IIT will never stop you from doing something. It will always help and support you (with scope and infrastructure) in whatever field (any hobbies, academic streams, etc.) you want to grow into. Now, what if you don’t get into IIT. After all only around 15000 students get to study out of more than 11 Lakh candidates. Is it difficult? YES What if you do not get into IIT? Nothing changes. An exam does not define how good you are. Always keep that in mind. The preparation you took for the past 2 years have developed your problem solving capabilities to a great extent. It has already developed your thought process. The preparation has already changed you in some aspects and you will realise this probably some years later. Lastly, do not give too much importance to the exam. Your life does not depend on it.

I was 12 at the time and am now 13. I have been watching PG-13 movies since I was 10, and since I was almost 13, my parents agreed to let me watch an R movie. I didn’t want there to be nudity or too much swearing or gore. There was a heck of a lot of swearing and some violence that I could handle, but luckily no nudity or sexual content. As long as there is no nudity and your kid is okay hearing a few f words or anything like that, I believe 12 or 13 is a good age to start watching R movies."},{"instruction":"Who is your favourite Egyptian pharaoh, and why?","output":"i think Akhenaten ,who was also the founder of Atenism and was the first known monotheist."},{"instruction":"Who represents the GOP in 2021?","output":"The House Minority Leader, and the Senate Minority Leader…pretty pitiful ain’t it."},{"instruction":"there any prayer which God hasn’t answered?","output":"No one can explain such matters except by reference to scripture and personal experience. Regarding the latter I can say that God works in mysterious ways and He is not like an Amazon ordering system. He often answers our prayers by changing us so that we can change things that we seek to change. Also divine interventions are sometimes subtle and unexpected. Also God is more interested in our long term spiritual journey and how we reach our ultimate destination than day to day problems. Along the way we will experience obstacles and troubles which is in the nature of following Christ. Jesus experienced many difficulties including betrayal, torture and death. God like a loving father knows what’s best for His children. Tough love often means denying a child’s request because it may be considered inappropriate or dangerous to the child’s healthy and safe development. As Christians we should be motivated by spiritual welfare and development rather than material welfare. At times we are also tested to strengthen our faith."},{"instruction":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","output":"One occasion my dog, my mate and I were out front of the house and my dog Jack squatted to have a pee, my mate says ‘you piss like a girl Jack’ (a phrase he’d NOT heard before), well, my mate got the filthiest of looks as a response and the next time my mate visited, Jack refused to acknowledge him and actually turned his head away when greeted, but as soon as my mate gave up and walked off, Jack leapt up and grabbed him around the calf almost face-planting my mate, Jack acted as though it was hilarious and I assumed it was payback for the offensive piss comment as that resulting action was a ‘one of’ event.

They reach the main area and shot all the guards on their way, utter chaos for the customers and bank staff, the gangsters made it to the vault in no time. The Vault was secured by an advanced security system, but the gangsters were fully prepared, with their gadgets and armaments, they opened the vault in a little time. The leader rejoiced and ordered a guy to enter the vault. The first guy entered the vault and Boom- disappeared for a few seconds, and then appeared unconscious. Second and Third guy entered- disappeared by a shadow, ended up like the first guy. The group leader thundered and ordered everyone to shoot the vigilante, everyone entered the vault firing on a shadow, which was moving carefully while deflecting the bullets fired on him with a bat-like weapon. Something like this: The Bank staff informed the police department about the heist and asked for immediate assistance. Meanwhile into the vault, the vigilante was doing his job with commitment, he was very patient in his application, and was perfectly handling the weapon(bat). The leader of the group lost all his men one by one in front of his eyes, he stood there in shock and disbelief, his weapons and talented men were all gone, his self-respect was shattered, his body was shivering, all of this was because of this one Guy, this vigilante, the one who defended the attack and stood like a wall between his men and Victory. The one who just disappeared in the vents. The Police teams were really quick to reach the bank and minutes later the leader of the gang was arrested by Police, surrounded by his fallen men and their tools of destruction, he was lost and dumbstruck by the turn of events he just had witnessed. Later during the police investigation, he(leader) said: “ We failed as a team, because of the Wall”. “The Wall” mumbled the little boy Rahul, who was curiously watching all of this on national news. “One day I’ll be Wall too” the little boy muttered to himself, he was holding a bat in one hand and a helmet(in place of the mask) in another, just like the hero of the bank.

I don’t think there are many companies that can match up to this quality there is no denying. If you think Apple not only makes laptops but also phones and tablets. Suddenly if they added touch screesn their tablats would be considered useless. Why? Because a consumer is very simple minded. He/She will simply see that it is pointless to own an iPad since they could invest in a laptop which in today’s modern society is necessarry and have an iPad and more functions in just one thing. So Apple would never be able to think an excuse to sell their iPads.

Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"If your manager has asked you for a resignation letter, it means that they are requesting that you voluntarily resign from your position rather than being terminated or fired. Essentially, they are asking you to submit a letter stating that you are resigning from your position, which would make it appear as though you resigned voluntarily rather than being fired. However, the decision to resign or be terminated ultimately depends on the circumstances surrounding your departure from the company. If your manager has communicated that they are not able to keep your position anymore and has asked you for a resignation letter, it's possible that this is a result of changes within the company or a need to reduce staff. In this case, it may be a mutual decision for you to resign. Alternatively, if your manager is forcing you to resign because of performance issues or misconduct, this could be considered a termination. If you have concerns about the situation, it may be a good idea to consult with a legal professional or your company's human resources department for guidance."},{"instruction":"What do you think should happen to people whose ancestors owned slaves in the southern part of the United States?","output":"Nothing bad.

This question is ridiculous."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","output":"How To Be Recession Proof In The Current State Of The Economy The current state of the economy may have a lot to do with what happened with Covid 2 years ago. But I think that Covid just speeded everything up to what was going to happen anyway. Interest Rates With interest rates planning to go sky high, the fuel prices all over the world already have. We are all just waiting for someone on the tv to say “we are in a recession” when we probably have been for 6 months. I think the world leaders are hesitant to actually say we are in a recession because many people panic. I mean everyone stocked up on toilet roll because they saw it on tv. This is why so many people have taken to building something online. Its digital – The government can make you stay at home, who cares They cant close your business down or stop you creating content to upload. Your customers are all over the world – its like having a 24 hour 7 day a week world wide shop. That’s 100% recession proof. When all business were forced to close – they turned to the internet to keep their business running. The problem was that offline business owners didn’t have a clue how to market themselves on the world wide web. How to target their perfect audience. Facebook made millions from people just creating ads and targeting every one in the world, which is pointless for a pizza delivery restaurant in a small town. So this forced company’s to out source the online work. To people online who would do the work for them, for a small commission. Some business have thrived since the pandemic due to moving online. Others have wasted money and gone under. Then people have started to realize the potential of working online from home – Some didn’t even go back to the job they had, even if they could. The skills you learn marketing online can be adapted to any business all over the world, its all connected to the internet. Things Will Only Get Worse With The Economy I see so many people struggling and trying to keep up with the bills coming in, even trying to ignore the fact of the cost of living going up, but the wages staying the same. Then banging it all on a credit card. I know people who work REALLY hard in their job because they want to keep it, only to find out one day – its gone. The whole business has been losing money and that means every single employee is also out of a job! This is why I think its vital to have a plan B, even if it’s an hour a day. You learn something new, look into another opportunity – don’t keep all you eggs in one basket. This will take the pressure off of you being so desperate to keep that one job, hope and preying that nothing happens and your unemployed. Who knows that plan B can become the Plan A one day. You can still continue to work for someone else in a job – but you wont be so worried that its not going to be there tomorrow. People have been building a business online for years, they have made the mistakes, they have spent 10 years testing things out and learning what works. Just like your supervisor at work. You learn the skills from them. That’s just what I did, I’m a 40 year old guy. The internet is for watching films and buying things I don’t need from eBay. I needed to learn from someone else. I needed to see just how they managed to build a business online and continue to thrive, even through the pandemic. That’s why I grabbed a copy of this book. Less than a chrome sky hood from eBay for 7! [LINKED_TEXT: Grab A Copy Here] [URL: https://rn132.isrefer.com/go/tieoffer/a6789/] I started to learn and haven’t stopped to this day.

Over the years I’ve gotten very good at getting what i need out of my PC’s on a budget. School saps a lot of money out of you so students don’t always have access to unlimited funds to buy a PC. So for the first question: What do you need this laptop to do? Think about your major, if you’ve declared one. Are you studying computer science or engineering? Are you an art student that may need some grunt for 3d rendering or working with hundreds of layers on digital artwork? Are you learning to be a game designer or rendering animated movies? These example use cases are some of the areas where i would say, go big. Get something with enough grunt to do the work you need it to. I had to upgrade my Dell Latitude i picked up when i started my Masters program earlier this year to a newer model Dell Precision because of the VM work i’m doing in my cyber security courses as part of my Masters degree. If you’re degree is art focused then maybe something with a discrete GPU would be useful as well. You likely wouldn’t need a gaming class GPU for a discrete but even something like an Nvidia mx350 would be a big boost over Intel’s integrated GPU. Also if you can find them, models that come with Ryzen processors often have much better than average performance when compared to other model integrated GPUs. So figuring out what you need for specs is important. Now if you’re a psychology major or an English major or something where you’ll be writing word docs and making power points but not much else other than emailing and internet research and whatnot, then you have a lot more flexibility and can go with something that costs a bit less. I’d still make sure you had something like an i3 processor or an i5 (as opposed to a Celeron or something in the ultra bdget range) and 8GB of RAM or better as a base line, so that for the basic tasks it runs consistently but you can get away with near the bottom of those specs to save some cash if you’re on a budget. So here’s what i would recommend for specs: General Tasks (ie. email, internet, watching videos, writing papers, designing power points, etc)Minimum: Intel i3 or Ryzen 3 processor, 8GB RAM or better, and a 250GB SSDRecommended: Intel i5 or Ryzen 5 processor, 8GB of RAM or better, and maybe a large SSD if you think you’ll need more space Artwork focused (ie. for rendering 3d graphics, game design, huge digital art projects with a lot of layers, etc)Minimum: Intel i5 processor or Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB RAM or better, 500GB SSD (these types of files can be large so more storage is important)Recommended: Intel i7 processor or Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM or better, 500GB SSD or better and depending on how heavy the art you want to work with is, a discrete GPU of some kind What i’m using as an adult student studying for his Masters in Information Technology:Started with a Dell Latitude with an i5 processor and 16GB of RAM with a 1TB SSD and an integrated GPU (got it for about 300). This was solid for my first semester which was a project management course which was all power point and MS Project, but when i started my Digital Forensic Analysis class and i had to be running multiple VM’s on that system, I needed an upgrade. So i sold it and bought this…Now using a Dell Precision 5530 with an 8th gen Intel 7, 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It also has a hyrbid discrete GPU setup with both an Intel GPU for the day to day (to conserve battery) and then an Nvidia Quadro P1000 discrete graphics card. Now i had the money in this case so i went a little over the top. I likely could have found another latitude with an i7 and more RAM and saved a little money but I really do love this machine. It flies and i got it refurbished for about 600, where new it would have been somewhere around 1500. The i7 latitude would have run me in the 400-600 range depending on how old the refurbished model i was looking at was. Question 2: how to shop for a solid school PC on a budget? Refurbished PC’s are a really good way to go if you’re on a budget. You can spend what it would cost to get something like a cheapy HP stream but end up with a couple year old business class laptop that’ll, bury that Stream in specs, last you for a long time and are, in many cases, upgradable and much easier to service if anything does break while you have it. Some shops even charge less to service business models because they are designed to be easier to work on then consumer machines. I do recommend that you stay away from consumer models when shopping for refurbs. Examples of this would be like: HP Pavilions, Dell Inspirons, Lenovo Ideapads, or pretty much anything that comes off the shelf at a Best Buy. Instead, find refurbished Dell Latitudes and Precisions, Lenovo ThinkPads, or HP Elitebooks or Probooks on Amazon or eBay. Many companies buy huge amounts of these model machines and then upgrade the hardware 2–4 years later and put these machines out to refurb companies to sell on places like eBay and Amazon. Now when you’re shopping for these, make sure you are looking at a manufacturer certified refurb company, or a Microsoft certified refurb company. They’ll have it indicated on their store pages on eBay and Amazon as well as other sellers like Newegg. Check how many happy customer reviews they have because some refurb shops are sloppy. I always look for certified ones with over a 95% positive feedback rating and they have to have a lot of reviews. Since following these rules for myself, i’ve never had a problem buying refurbished computers. Below are some models i would recommend for general use and 1 or 2 for the more high powered needs. I hope this is helpful. Good luck shopping and in school.

You have an entire agency who’s only purpose is to know -WHO- has -WHAT- physical copy of a classified document -WHERE- that maintains the following chain of custody log, that states who has exactly which copies (they are numbered) and where container security log, that lists exactly which classified documents are inside (the ones not out on a custody log) and sealed with a two signature tamper proof security seal facilities audit log that is two person signed that is checked 3 times a shift to verify that no seals are broken or tampered with copy audit log that tracks exactly how many copies are made (It has a physical counter that can’t be reset) that also logs where each copy is assigned (custody or container log) And folks want me to believe that 15 BOXES existed that NO ONE had any idea what they were or who had them, and went unnoticed for MONTHS with a 3 time a shift security audit being performed… If the files were that OH MUH GERD critical and vital security then why did they not use the logs, find who had them, and retrieve them -MONTHS- ago? If the files were -NOT- that critical and vital to security, then why the sudden ‘accidental leak’ to the media to get outrage about them? If they want to claim that they -WERE- that vital, but haven’t known for months, then why have we not heard about the massive agency purge and convictions of those who were supposed to be maintaining the logs, and performing the security audits for -MONTHS- but were not? So if he was not legally supposed to have them, they would have been noted as being missing, logs shown exactly what documents they were, and retrieved -months- ago, then the obvious elephant in the room logic is that he had them legitimately, provided by the GSA, and they knew exactly what he had."},{"instruction":"the U.S., you need a birth certificate to get your Social Security card, and you need your Social Security card to get your birth certificate, so what do you do if you have neither?","output":"Birth certificates and Social Security cards are issued, by law, shortly after birth.

My daughter in law is refusing to vaccinate her children based on this belief.","output":"Vaccines absolutely do NOT cause autism. Chemicals that got into the mother’s bloodstream, which then got into the fetus’s bloodstream, are the most likely culprit in my opinion. It takes years for brain differences like autism or ADHD or other learning differences to develop. Why are so many cases of autism detected soon after so many vaccines are administered? Before age three, it is not possible for most psychiatrists and other experts to detect the behavioral signs that indicate that a child might be autistic. I have Asperger’s, a form of autism, but I was not diagnosed until I was in my 40’s. Having been born in 1951, doctors did not recognize mental differences like ADHD, Asperger’s, autism, etc. I wonder if chemicals in the environment where she worked in the years before I was born were the cause. She worked for my grandfather, her father, a Lathing Contractor, and I’d imagine that their warehouse and office space often smelled of chemicals that were used in that industry. If you read more about the [LINKED_TEXT: lathing] [URL: https://www.bobvila.com/articles/lath-and-plaster/#%3A~%3Atext%3DDense%20lath%20and%20plaster%20provides%2C%2C%20fire%20resistance%2C%20and%20soundproofing.%26text%3DLath%20and%20plaster%20walls%20provide%2Cone%20room%20to%20the%20next.], you’ll see that chemicals could easily be a part of the problem. I sometimes wonder: Did some types of lathing have asbestos as an ingredient? If my mother was not protected against airborne asbestos in Grandpa’s offices, did the air she breathed contribute to my autism?Did the lead paint (popular in the 1940’s) painted onto the lath surfaces enter her environment? If lead flaked off the walls, could that ingredient have gotten into the food she ate, and stay in her bloodstream long enough to affect my tiny fetal brain when the percentage amount of lead or asbestos or other poison in the fetal bloodstream was much higher than the percentage amount of poisons in my mother’s brain? Of course, parents do not want to blame environmental poisons during pregnancy because that means that some parents will feel guilty, so instead, they blame doctors. Think about it. The amount of chemical in a vaccine is very tiny compared to the size of a three year old child’s brain, but the amount of poison in a mother’s bloodstream, entering a developing fetal brain, is much larger as a proportion. I am very happy that my mother made sure that I got all my vaccines. I did not get polio like one of my friends who was born a few years before I was (who I did not meet until we were both in our 40s). I did not develop any major illnesses for which I was protected.

The Big Bang theory, in spite of the name, makes no such claim. Fourth, and final problem: it has the same shortcoming as my new theory, the Big Beachball Theory: It’s unfalsifiable.

So, he takes care of our children when he comes back home. At night, he gives them a bath while I wash the dishes and tide up. It’s all a team effort and we are both happy. Whenever one of us needs a break, the other one takes care of everything. My advice to all of you who don’t get any help is: Ask for it. You and your husband are both capable of sharing house chores, to give each other a break, and to help around. You need to take a moment for yourself, it is almost a requirement to have a “me-time” in order to be emotionally, physically, and mentally fit. We all do: we all get tired and we all need help.

So we went to this Multiplex called ‘Movietime’ located in Chembur, Mumbai. That Multiplex had around 4–5 screens and was around 5 storeys tall. When we got into our respective screen the experience was just marvelous with a huge curved screen and to add to the natural environment of Wakanda it had Dolby Atmos which gave amazing experience (normally in multiplexes you mostly get Dolby Surround). The experience of watching a movie with Atmos was just serene but only did we know that what did we have in store post interval… Everything was going right when we ended up with this… Everything went blank… they also stopped the AC in the hall which made it quite suffocating for all of us… people were furious over the staff and officials as after all this was completely unprofessional from their side running a huge multiplex. They spoiled the link of the movie as when they tried to resume watching the projector would itself shut down. Regardless to say, our 3:00 PM show ran till 6:30 PM (-_-). If anyone's planning to watch a movie there then please think twice before you go… We further went on to hear it from many mutual friends that it was a common issue with 3D movies in their cinema halls.

Even why you’re speeding. I got pulled over by a Louisiana State Trooper once for 110 in a 60, around midnight. He’d been tailing me (pacing my speed) for about three miles. From the driver’s seat, all I saw was a car staying inches off my bumper for miles and matching my lane changes-a red flag to most. After a while, I decided to speed up and see what he did, figuring maybe he’s following me. I was already cruising along at 75(the roads were mostly empty). I hit the gas to Pass a line of cars then take the exit last second after passing them if he was following for some reason. Sure enough, when I dropped the hammer, so did he! Complete with lights and sirens-oops. Well, he gets to the window and asks if I knew why he pulled me over, and I tell him I fucked up a smidge-didn’t realize it was a cop behind me and thought someone was following me for some reason, dangerously close to my bumper and wanted to get them off my bumper, as, being so dark, it didn’t look like a cop car since I couldn’t see his light bar. He told me he had been pacing me for three miles and had me at 75mph-fifteen over but the roads were pretty clear and I hadn’t seemed to be driving dangerously so he wasn’t going to pull me over-until I dropped the hammer and broke 100mph. But, for all that, he seemed to be in a good mood-or just not feel like doing paperwork-and I guess my story was understandable, being 18 probably didn’t hurt either-who doesn’t do stupid shit at that age? Because he cut me loose with a verbal warning, and told me to “keep it under 100”. My brother, on the other hand, was pulled over by a small town cop for 98 in a 45(clocked, but he went a bit faster than that and everybody knew it, in fact he hit the Governor-which would be 110mph). He was driving flat out, engine screaming, down some old country back roads, when he passed through the main drag, foot to the floor and never touched the brakes. He blew passed the one cop on duty, writing a ticket. As he gets down the road, he realizes he forgot his phone at our cousin’s place back the way he’d come so he turned around and passed through town, again, foot to the floor and blew passed the town’s cop AGAIN, And never even noticed him. The cop, having finished writing his ticket, couldn’t believe the audacity and gave chase to this crusty rapscallion, determined to put a stop to these antics. For my brother’s, part, he’s got the radio blaring some old rock ‘n’ roll, engine screaming, barreling through the turns just as fast as that old truck could bear, and that poor old cop just couldn’t keep up, losing my brother somewhere along the way, having never noticed the cop trying to pull him over since at those speeds, in those roads, he’s so intently focused on the road ahead. He gets to our cousin’s, grabs his phone and what does he do? Passes right through town yet again, full speed ahead, and again, without noticing, blows the door off our old friend, Who we now refer to as ole Roscoe P. Coltrain. From the passenger seat, I suggest we go visit our brother’s and uncle’s grave sites and leave some pot on our uncle’s gravestone for him, as is our old tradition, since it isn’t too far. So we get to the turn where we gotta cross some railroad tracks and he slows down for the crossing. As he does, the cop closes the distance and as he turns in, I catch sight of those old blues and twos turning in behind us. After a brief discussion, we figure he’s close enough that he’ll have the plates to run so we may as well pull over. Pulled over, just across the tracks and the cop gets to the window, and the first words out of mouth are “why did you run from me back there”? To a truck full of dumbfounded teenagers. “Wait, WHAT?!” Well, that old cop follows up, “ look, I’m about to get off and I would hate to have to stay late to fill out arrest paperwork, give me one good reason why I shouldn’t arrest you.” So, quick on my feet, I piped up, pointing out our speed and the narrow country roads, the fact that the radio was blasting and everybody was watching for any cars about to pull out ahead, so nobody would have been looking behind us. That seemed to satisfy him, somewhat, so he cut my brother a break and didn’t arrest him. But he did write him a ticket for 98 in a 45–53MPH over, and a little more than double the speed limit. It was a mandatory court appearance, and did I say this was a small town tree? I meant SMALL town, really really SMALL. He gets to the courthouse and meets with the judge, over a kitchen table and they work it out-judge asks him if he learned his lesson, and my brother replies “no, I’m gonna probably do it again because I’m young and dumb, but I won’t be doing it again here.” Perhaps not the best answer to the question, but it seemed to have earned him some respect in the eyes of this judge for honesty, at least. Judge gave him a break-still a painful one, but could have been a whole lot worse. Fine of 450, plus defensive driving school and, under a deferral program, provided he successfully completed the defensive driving school, the interaction wouldn’t be reported on his record. Judge let him make a payment plan on the fine, and get completed the defensive driving school so his insurance didn’t take a massive hike. now, that cop could have arrested him on the spot, and the judge could have sentenced him to jail or taken his license or imposed much larger fines. That’s just one outcome, much is left to the officer’s discretion on the streets, and judicial discretion in the courtroom."},{"instruction":"Who would win, Itachi Uchiha vs Tobirama Senju?","output":"Let's consider both contestant in their prime stage. Tobirama senju, 2nd hokage, was one of the strongest shinobi at that time. He was considered as father of ninjutsu. He made many jutsus like shadow clone, water style, Edo tensie. He has vast amount of chakra reserves. Itachi on the other hand had fearsome mangekyo sharingan. He was considered as second strongest uchiha after madara. Since we took both in their prime Conditions, let's disregard the health issue of Itachi. Taijutsu With his sharingan, Itachi had plus point in close range combat as he can predict opponent's movement. Not to forget his shuriken techniques are noteworthy. Tobirama had access to shadow clone jutsu, but he wasn't as efficient as Naruto and Itachi could easily find the real tobirama with his sharingan. Ninjutsu. Father of ninjutsu sure has some awesome jutsu in his aresenal. Tobirama is known for his amazing use of water style jutsu. But does he have what it takes to beat Itachi? Well the answer is No. With the help of mangekyo sharingan, Itachi had access to amaterasu, which he can use both of offense as well as defense. Equipping susanoo with yata mirror and blade of totsuka, Itachi is invincible. Tobirama was not much of a strategist, he was offensive shinobi. I believe Itachi would knock down tobirama with ease. Genjutsu. You know the answer there. Tsukuyomi is quite troublesome even for tobirama who had quite some battles with uchihas. Tobirama was immune to genjutsu to some extent, but tsukuyomi is much bigger deal. Chakra reserves. Tobirama had much large reserves than Itachi. Even though we have neglected the health condition of Itachi, he had much less chakra reserves from beginning. Well since this is 1 vs 1 battle, itachi holds slight upper hand. But we can't say about how much time Itachi would hold himself against such strong opponent. Itachi always hated the idea of fighting. But if they are forced to kill one another, Itachi will win."},{"instruction":"What are the responsibilities of a business analyst?","output":"Following are the responsibilities included in [LINKED_TEXT: business analyst jobs] [URL: https://www.itekinsight.com/] : By collaborating closely with IT and financial reporting teams to establish initiatives and strategies to improve importing and optimize costs, BAs are accountable for the creation of new models that support business decisions."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for starting a successful homebased business using social media platforms (like Facebook) for selling purposes?","output":"Starting a successful home-based business using social media platforms like Facebook for selling purposes can be an effective strategy.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Short answer - yes! I had a long debate with my husband when we were deciding the right school for our kids some years ago. We jotted down the pros & cons of different schools and finally decided to go ahead with an international school for the below reasons: Smaller Classes: For the public schools in India, the teacher to student ratio is very high. In the majority of the public schools we checked, the average ratio was around 1:60 due to which the child does not get enough attention. In international or private schools, the ratio is around 1:30, which allows individual attention to the kid's need. Extracurricular activities:Even though the primary focus must be on academics, the child should be equally exposed to other extracurricular activities such as music, dance, sports or arts, which is done more frequently in international schools. Parental Involvement: With private or international schools, you, as a parent get more opportunity to be involved in the activities of your kid. There are more meetings with the class teacher, and you are aware of what your kid is exactly doing at the school. More Exposure: We have enrolled our children in Ebenezer International School in Bangalore, which allows them more exposure to children from different communities across the world, enriching their social skills, which we think would not be possible in case of a regular public school."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

If we make comparison between both the stones then there are following things that can be noticed, and, are helpful for a naive person who has to choose between marble and granite for [LINKED_TEXT: flooring tiles] [URL: https://www.marnite.co/]. Granite Tiles has a very different physical appearance as compared to marble tiles because granite stones has dotted pattern over it because of melted stones within it, and it comes in a variety of colors. Granite is a harder stone as compared to marble thus it is stronger and this hard texture of granite stone gives granite tiles more glossy, bright and shiny look. Granite tile is porous in nature, so it absorbs any liquid spilled on it and thus leave stains. The granite tile is not easy to get damaged like if a chemical liquid spills over it it does not get damaged. Now, coming towards marble stones. The first thing is difference in appearance. Marble stone comes in very typical few colors (solid grayish-white or cream color) and its very rare that it comes in other colors like pale green and pink base. Marble tiles have dark veins like pattern printed over it, because of impurities of minerals. Unlike Granite, Marbles are soft in nature and are easy to get damaged, however, marble tiles are also porous in nature and absorbs any liquid spilled over it. Marble tiles also has low chemical resistance. Therefore, Marble tiles have low durability, due to its ‘softness’ it is recommended to uses unsanded grout with marble in order to increase its durability. However, polishes and sealants can increase marble's resistance considerably. Granite's durable nature makes it suitable for Kitchen counter tops and floors, while marble is more appropriate in areas with less traffic, like bathrooms, where it can be used for vanities, tub decks, shower walls, and flooring. Marble can create a light and unique look and can be good for surfaces that will not get much use, or for people who are willing to put in the maintenance work and do not mind if their surfaces have a bit of character over time. If we talk about Cost then both marble and granite have almost equal cost.

However, as the Kobayashi Maru is specifically designed to be a no-win scenario, it is unlikely that Data, or any other Starfleet cadet, would be able to pass it without violating the rules of the simulation. In the Star Trek universe, the purpose of the Kobayashi Maru is to test a cadet's character and decision-making abilities in the face of a situation that cannot be solved through conventional means. The scenario involves a civilian ship, the Kobayashi Maru, being stranded in enemy territory, and the cadet must make a choice between rescuing the ship and violating the Federation's neutrality or abandoning the ship and leaving the crew to their fate. While Data's advanced computational abilities and lack of emotional bias may give him an edge in analyzing the situation and making the best decision, the outcome of the scenario is ultimately predetermined to be unwinnable. In Star Trek canon, only one person has ever \\"beaten\\" the Kobayashi Maru, and that was James T. Kirk, who famously reprogrammed the simulator to allow for a different outcome.

So this do not let anyone to write the contrary to you. I may try to answer your question by another question: what makes you think so? And second question: You compare Armenia to which other country to make such a judgement / having a such mindset? Your answers to yourself will be the answer to your question. Now let me say some things that can make you see things differently. A country is not a block of marble, all country in the world are just mosaics: they are all composed of multitude of people having different ideas, traditions and way of life. I can not say to any country that it is entirely xyz. Because some people in this country are abc others in the same country are xyz etc. Now on the other side, every countries\`s government in the world, due to historical geographical and many other factor, may act and speak differently in time. That is normal. Some political actions and speechs are bad and some others are good and some others are semi good semi bad. Also a judgement of xxx as \`bad\` by person A, can be judged as \`good\` by B and \`semi bad/semi good\` by C. All 3 say some real/true things, and some unreal/lies. And some others may just express a hope, a dream/ a future strategy. So No one can say that any of them is right and the others are wrong. Read and listen to all the 3 opinions, and make a synthesis by yourself. The good thing in synthesis it makes a mixture of all and just leave some questions. That is a good way to see things. So analyse Armenia using this technic. Just an additional tool to you for seeing that opinion of the same country may change in time too: An X country could have been conservative in its majority yesterday, but today they may become non-conservative in its majority. And tomorrow this may change into modernism and reformism or any other political tendency you can imagine. All are due to many internal and external factors. As you can see it is way too much complex to get a judgement about a country. This may explain you why I wrote the first two question at the beginning of my actual writing. Everything in this world should be seen like ying and yang: you may never judge with black and white but with grey. If you want to know more about any country, so about Armenia, you might read from different source (because when someone talks about a country, there is always propaganda in each writing and speech). So you must read different propaganda writings (even scientists, political researchers, think tanks do propaganda in their writings; that is human nature) and listen the opinion of different political personalities. I lived in Russia and in Kazakhstan about in total 5 years. I met some Armenians there. Communism tendency Armenians think completely different than conservative and modernist Armenians. They all see their country differently. This thing is valid for all the countries in the world."},{"instruction":"What is issuing authority in a passport?

Ok qualitative is by its very nature based on not having a precise scale or point of reference. The water is hot. Qualitative! The water is 47.340 degrees Celsius. Quantitative! Qualitative is your opinion, it is compared in your head to something else in your head. “The joke is very funny” Tell a joke to 100 people and ask them to describe how they would categorise the joke and you actually have 100 non comparable scales being used. Their replies are how they feel and you then have to interpret that information by comparing how you believe they they feel about the joke. However, you yourself are now comparing relative feelings based on your interpretations. A machine cannot do that because it requires perception, machines measure they don't perceive. Look up a 1960’s computer “composing” music randomly in real time. People actually did this and gave their opinion on this new and novel music. It sounded crap, there was no structure at all and it was not by even music by Jazz standards. The point of all this ramblings that if you don't have a scale, a machine cannot give you an answer other than something random. You as a person can compare it to something you like and your qualitative perception is the only non scalar method of measuring it."},{"instruction":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","output":"The only tremendous tip I did was 20.

I am answering from my own experience of an unhealthy and possibly abusive relationship. children. The way the law in my country works I am pretty sure that if we split he would get 50per cent custody of my child at least. While I know that for a child to be in the home of an abusive relationship is damaging I fear that if we split and my partner had 50 percent custody of my child the situation would be worse. His father would become more bitter and angry which would affect my child. I would not be present to intervene when he got stressed and angry at my child. He would be emotionally manipulative and turn my child against me and my family. I have already seen how he manipulates my child and think it would be much worse if we separated. Some people will tell me that my child will realize when he is an adult. I am not confident about that and want to spare him from the stress of listening to his father say bad things about me. As I grew up in a family where my parents divorced I know that divorce (while it may be the best option for some) is not a magical solution that heals all problems and that when parents try to turn their child against each other it can be very upsetting and stressful for a child. I am doing things to try to limit the damage to my child, eg visiting my brother and sister-in-law so my child can see a couple that has affection for each other. you are manipulated by your partner into blaming yourself. One of my partner's favorite things to say to me during an argument is that I should have a long hard look at myself in the mirror. Every time that gets to me and I have doubts about myself. The emotional abuse I got from my partner was a major contributor, I believe, to me becoming mentally sick, although he tells me I brought it on myself. When he told me that I needed to see a psychologist, as a put-down, that was some of the best advice he gave me. When I followed the advice and saw a psychologist she gave me information about abusive relationships.isolation- they isolate you from friends and family who can tell you that the abusive persons expectations are not reasonable.the cycle of violence. I have seen other answers referring to this, using various names for it. You have a cycle where you have bad times, the abuser may apologize, they may act normal and then the abuse happens again. During a good time, you think maybe the bad times are over. You think “well people say there are good and bad times in a marriage”, you don't want to be a fairweather friend but want to be there through thick and thin, etc.religion and your marriage vow such as “for better or worse”. I no longer believe that a loving God would want me to go through the living hell I experienced.economics. The law and social welfare still make it very difficult financially to separate as does the cost of living and buying or renting a house.Fear or rumors and lies partner will spread about me in a small community and how that will affect employment. Sometimes mud sticksperhaps because my parents divorced I hadn’t had enough experience that a relationship could be better. I had also heard divorced and married women complaining about men but didn't hear a lot of positive comments about men so didn't have high expectations of men's behavior. Also as Lori Jones wrote the more committed I became in my relationship or the more dependent I was on him the worse he was. He became worse the week we got married, worse when I became pregnant, worse when I had the baby, worse when we moved far away from my family and friends and I became mentally sick. Having a bit more financial dependence and better health now helps me to stand up more and feel better, as does getting some professional help. As a side note, I hate it when I hear people commenting about all the divorces these days and that people don't try enough anymore. The people who say that should be grateful that they simply have no concept of what some people have been through and how hard they tried.

Japanese pilots were so poorly trained at this point (due to high losses, lack of fuel/aircraft for training) and American defenses strong (combat air patrol, ship screen deployment, proximity fuse anti-air fire) that it was unlikely they were going to score many hits. It’s also in a way, a waste of resources to train them super well just due to the superior American planes and pilots. They’re just too likely to die in a regular dogfight. Let’s say they can drop a bomb and hit a ship 8% of the time- even if they hit it’s possible Americans can control the damage. It’s also highly probable a pursuing fighter or some AA fire will take out the Japanese plane as it leaves. If they fly in and crash the plane directly into a ship- it doesn’t really matter if they take a hit on the way down or not. Let’s say 25% of these kamikaze runs are successful- that’s more than three times as effective and the aviation. fuel combined with ordinance carried would do a lot more damage than the bombs alone.

They have raised you up and surely they do care about you. But in those thoughts never let yourself down.You must know to balance the parents advice and your thoughts. If you have feelings for somebody, please do confess otherwise it might gets late. But be sure you are not totally crazy about the person so that you should not loose your goals. Chase your dreams and believe in your potentials.Believe in yourself and positivity must be always with you. Feel free to talk and never hold your words back as if there arrives the matter that you must clarify. Just go for it. Learn that it's okay to open-up with someone about what you are feeling, just don't deal alone with all your problems, anxiety and depressions. It's okay to take help from others. Never mind what judgemental society and people tells you. Don't let their judgement Confined you. Never give up is something I would definitely choose to advice you. Never feel low just because you are not beautiful than the next girl you visited in your college canteen, you are your own kind of beautiful. Never allow yourself to be addicted to drugs and drinks though your friends are requesting you so hard.Just don't do that. Give more time to yourself than others.

If you ever get over and on top of your stride, then you go, ‘oh wow, I was slowing myself down’. It’s not easy to break the braking habit. People say lift your knees, up your cadence, be light on your feet, land on your forefoot (and let the heel come down as a tap), toe off properly, snap your foot back so you have to snap it forward, etc. But if you can’t get there in your head, you aren’t there, are you? Or as the old camp song says, ‘we’re here because we’re here because we’re here because we’re here!’ You gotta get there from here. Lots of people seem to think that jamming their foot into the ground - with those cushioned, angled heels, is how you’re supposed to land. Uh, no.

People often find it difficult to let go of the past. In the case of the Palestinians, they also have the misfortune of leaders who have gotten rich from the conflict, and therefore have every incentive to keep it going. These leaders also have a reputation for brutality and not tolerating dissent in any form. As a result, Fatah rules the Palestinian areas of the West Bank with an iron hand, and hasn’t held elections since 2005. Hamas was elected to a four-year term in 2006, and hasn’t held elections since then either. Perhaps one day there will be a strong Palestinian leader more interested in a bright future than in rehashing the past.

OBL was internationally designated terrorist and was into hiding while this Masood guy is roaming freely in Pakistan gives speeches etc. So assasinating him should be relatively easy. However it was Mr IK Gujral who shut down all the counter spying wing of R&AW during his tenure and I think we are still struggling from that. This shows we are not having proper resources and assets inside the enemy territory. We should have emulated Israeli model of assasinating enemies deep inside enemy territories like KIDON units of Israel.

So some of the countries where the CIA were operating black sites like Poland and Germany started getting “cold feet” and wanted the sites closed. Others, like Egypt were experiencing political unrest so the CIA’s activities were being curtailed. So Guantanamo Bay was chosen. Here the prisoners had neither legal, or human rights. They could be, and were, tortured. They could even be murdered. Who knows? Maybe some were murdered. Some of those they were holding there wasn’t even who the CIA thought they were.

He had a very aggressive contract that I reluctantly agreed to and I kept to the letter of the contract. As the contract was coming to termination he sent us notification that the rent would be increasing by some insane amount (I think it was between 600 - 900 a month) we politely declined to renew. We asked if he would allow us to extend the current contract for a month so our kids could finish the school year but he was adamant that we be out of the house by a certain date and we agreed. ( I had to relocate my 8 month pregnant wife and our children out of state while we waited for our offer to close on the new home we were buying.) Then he ran into a problem. No one wanted to rent the place at the price he was asking or would agree to his insane contract terms (i.e he wanted family pictures so he could give them to the police if needed.) A week before our contract expired he contacted me and asked if I wanted to continue renting the house at the existing rate. I laughed and thanked him for his call and informed him we were just wrapping up the last few items prior to the final inspection. When he and his wife arrived for the inspection they were surprised at how nice we maintained the house. He tried again, now that the house was completely empty and spotless, to get me to reconsider the lease at the original rate and I declined. A month or so later we found out he hid our trash cans that were supposed to be picked up by trash removal company so I had to go back to the new tenants and help them understand that trash cans they were using didn’t belong to the land lord and they needed to return them to Waste Management.

Digital, low voltage differential signals either get there, or they don’t… these are much cheaper to make than analog cables, which can gradually degrade your signal.

In a minute or two, I can find out exactly how much I should be paying for that new 4K television I’ve had my eye on (hmm… about a grand… it’s been dropping in price!). Your local big box store can’t get away with charging significantly more than an online retailer would charge. But when you buy that TV, you’re going to be anxious to hook it up, maybe add a few accessories. And that’s why these prices are so high. Some stores will make significantly more money on accessories in the typical sale than they make on the main item. And that’s because you’re not paying attention to the price of the accessories… you just dropped a grand or more on that new TV. You’re probably not thinking that you can get the same cable online, in a day or two, for 5 rather than 40. This is actually part of a general sales model these days. Even in Wal-Mart. When you got to a Wal-Mart, there are big signs telling you how much you’re saving on various items. The Wal-Mart people have been studying buying habits in thousands of stores, and they know which items are price sensitive and which are more likely impulse buys. One example: books. Okay, sure, who both shops at Wal-Mart and reads? But seriously… years back, around the time I got my first Android phone, my wife wanted to shop for a few things in a Wal-Mart. I was testing out the new barcode app, which scanned a barcode and gave me a bunch of prices and locations for the item. I was amazed that every book at Wal-Mart was full list price, significantly more expensive than Amazon. Because, of course, no one goes to Wal-Mart to buy a book… but if you see a book while passing the book section, you might just grab it, without price shopping.

It was common for the warehouse boss to hand me the company van keys and a check in an envelope, and ask me to go to the bank and trade it for cash. The boss could then give the cash to the vendor. Checks were usually between 200 -500 dollars - no worries. Stuff it in my pocket and go back to work. One time, the teller looks at the check, and looks at me. She looks at the check and looks at me. She calls for her boss. She looks at the check and looks at me. She then has a hushed phone call, I guessed to my employer. I didn’t take this stuff as an insult. I was working in an un-cooled warehouse in the deep south, and I was a pretty shabby dresser at the time. The teller returns and pushes THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS across the counter to me.

When she wanted to sleep in the bedroom with me and the other cat, I moved the box into my bedroom and she slept in that every night. It was her one place of comfort, that smelled familiar and made her feel safe. Bring the trees with you. Cats often need familar smells to adapt to a new home.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","output":"The number one reason why private schools are “better” are the admission requirements. If you don’t measure up- to a certain minimum, you can’t attend. When you then take averages of the kids using whatever metric you choose, the average of the school that takes the average to good students will be much higher than that of the one that takes lousy to good students. The private schools pick and choose while the public schools are required to take anyone who lives in the local area, no matter their abilities or disabilities. Charter schools play this game all the time. The student that applies for a lottery is by nature a better student than the one who doesn’t care. Will a lazy student attend a charter that requires 8–5 classes, or Saturday classes, or the constant pressures of a place like KIPP? If a student doesn’t measure up at a charter, they are encouraged to switch back before they affect averages or graduation percentages. Second, the tuition and the ability to expel. Again, better students make for better averages. If you’ve let go students who don’t work hard enough, or who do stupid things, your “scores” go up. If a family is mostly well-educated, it usually means that they are also willing to put effort into the things that make up education. If every role model is motivated, educated, willing to work 3 hours a night on homework, then the student probably will too. Selection comes up again with out-of-town students. Public school draws from the local area, good or bad. Private schools draw the best students from a much larger area, and often from out-of-country. If you’re sending a child 12,000 miles and prepaying all tuition/fees/room/board, you’re not sending a dummy. The final reason is that private schools don’t get scored on the same metric as public ones do. A public school is made or broken on the same scale and criteria, while the private school will hire a PR company to showcase them at their best. We have this in Vermont. The public schools use one set of testing, while the private academies may trot out their SAT results or their AP results, conveniently forgetting to mention that 1/2 of their senior class is from other countries, and are re-taking calculus to get the AP credit and learn some English. Maybe the private school talks only about its endowment, or has pictures of its beautiful campus. Here in Vermont, there are four private schools that are also the local public school. Their students take the same standardized tests, but the private schools don’t have to make bad results public."},{"instruction":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test?

To figure out a purpose for your life that you want to devote yourself to, you need to know what you find meaningful. A true purpose is only sustainable as long as it is meaningful to you, because this is the only way to achieve fulfillment. Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl spent his life helping others to create meaning in their lives. The Sources of Meaning There are three main sources from which a person can create meaning in life. 1. Doing something significant (work, good deeds, accomplishments): Meaning can be found in doing something that we consider important and of value, something that improves the lives of others or of humanity as a whole. This is of course very subjective, but you will know deep down if you deem this work as significant and fulfilling. 2. By experiencing something or encountering someone (love, beauty, nature): Experiencing nature, beauty, culture etc. can result in a feeling of awe and give meaning to life. Also love can create meaning, because only through love, one can “grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.” Frankl explains as follows: “By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.” 3. By our attitude in times of adversity (suffering, guilt, death): Meaning can be found even in spite of the “tragic triad”: I) suffering, II) guilt and III) death, through what Frankl calls “tragic optimism”: “(I) Turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment, because in some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. (II) Deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better. (III) Deriving from life’s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.” In general, Frankl suggests the following: “Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. ” Meaning exists as potential. By taking on responsibility this meaning can and should be actualized. But most importantly, the three sources of meaning all have one thing in common. The idea of self-transcendence. Frankl describes the relationship between self-actualization and self-transcendence as follows: I have termed this constitutive characteristic “the self-transcendence of human existence.” It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself — be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself — by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love — the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. This has profound consequences for our understanding of the hierarchy of human needs. The ultimate source of meaning and fulfillment and thus the top of the pyramid is self-transcendence. In “Father Reaches of Human Nature” Abraham Maslow explains: “Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos” So how do you create a life purpose? Gaining clarity about yourself, what matters most to you and what would be meaningful to you. How do you figure out? Well, by asking yourself the right questions and thinking about them. These questions might be something like: “What do I value?”, “What am I good at?”, “What interests me?”, “Where do I find meaning?”, “What are the things I want to do before I die?”, “What do I want others to say about me at my funeral?” “What value do I want to contribute back to the world”? In our busy, hectic daily lives it is often difficult to find the time to think about questions like these. So you inevitably have to make time for them. A good way is to create a commitment by blocking a time slot in your calendar, say one hour every Sunday, just for pondering these questions and thinking. As soon as you get some clarity about these questions (full clarity does not have to be achieved yet), you can establish some kind of long-term vision of how you want your life to look like in the distant future and principles/values you want to live by. Then, take action. Try different career lanes and different projects and see if you resonate with them. Make sure to regularly reflect on these questions and if your current live situations do satisfy them.

The truth is, this just cannot be known. Folks who use a firearm to resolve a potentially criminal situation without firing the gun, seldom report the incident, for fear of unexpected, negative repercussions. I know of a couple of potentially criminal incidents that were ended without the firearm even being presented. The stalkers (can’t call them attackers at this point) were simply made aware of the presence of a firearm. This is just as surely a defensive gun use, as actually presenting the weapon. Since these events never get reported, how can we quantify them? This topic has interested researchers enough that many went to great expense to conduct polls. Surely not the most reliable measure, but just as surely, the only possible way get a sense of just how often firearms are used to stop crime. One poll would not be very revealing, but multiple polls could give us a reasonably accurate sense of the question… the more the better. As it happens we actually do have quite a number of polls asking just this question… Examining the graph, we can see that the most conservative average is, that firearms are used to stop crime about 1.4 million times per year, or almost 5 times as often as firearms are used to commit crimes. Edit 230221: I ran a across recent pertinent information I would like to include. In 2021, Professor William English Conducted the 2021, National Firearms Survey, the most comprehensive ever research on firearms in America, which was published in 2022 by, Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. Unsurprisingly Professor English’s findings were consistent with the above graph… Consistent with other recent survey research, the survey finds an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9%, suggesting that in excess of 81.4 million Americans aged 18 and over own firearms. The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners (31.1%) have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense (used in 65.9% of defensive incidents), and in most defensive incidents (81.9%) no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter (25.2%) of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half (53.9%) occurred outside their home, but on their property. About one out of ten (9.1%) defensive gun uses occurred in public, and about one out of twenty (4.8%) occurred at work. [LINKED_TEXT: 2021 National Firearms SurveyAbstract This report summarizes the findings of a national survey of firearms ownership and use conducted between February 17th and March 23rd, 2021 by the professional survey firm Centiment. This survey, which is part of a larger book project, aims to provide the most comprehensive assessment of firearms ownership and use patterns in America to date. This online survey was administered to a representative sample of approximately fifty-four thousand U.S. residents aged 18 and over, and it identified 16,708 gun owners who were, in turn, asked in-depth questions about their ownership and their use of firearms, including defensive uses of firearms. Consistent with other recent survey research, the survey finds an overall rate of adult firearm ownership of 31.9%, suggesting that in excess of 81.4 million Americans aged 18 and over own firearms. The survey further finds that approximately a third of gun owners (31.1%) have used a firearm to defend themselves or their property, often on more than one occasion, and it estimates that guns are used defensively by firearms owners in approximately 1.67 million incidents per year. Handguns are the most common firearm employed for self-defense (used in 65.9% of defensive incidents), and in most defensive incidents (81.9%) no shot was fired. Approximately a quarter (25.2%) of defensive incidents occurred within the gun owner's home, and approximately half (53.9%) occurred outside their home, but on their property. About one out of ten (9.1%) defensive gun uses occurred in public, and about one out of twenty (4.8%) occurred at work. A majority of gun owners (56.2%) indicate that they carry a handgun for self-defense in at least some circumstances, and about 35% of gun owners report carrying a handgun with some frequency. We estimate that approximately 20.7 million gun owners (26.3%) carry a handgun in public under a \`\`concealed carry'' regime; and 34.9% of gun owners report that there have been instances in which they had wanted to carry a handgun for self-defense, but local rules did not allow them to carry. The average gun owner owns 5 firearms, and handguns are the most common type of firearm owned. 48.0% of gun owners have owned magazines that hold over 10 rounds, and 30.2% of gun owners -- totaling about 24.6 million individuals -- have owned an AR-15 or similarly styled rifle. Demographically, gun owners are diverse. 42.2% are female and 57.8% are male. Approximately 25.4% of Blacks own firearms, 28.3% of Hispanics own firearms, 19.4% of Asians own firearms, and 34.3% of Whites own firearms.https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145#] [URL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887145]"},{"instruction":"w quickly would the world end if all rain became hydrochloric acid?","output":"first of all,all rain,everywhere,in oceans,rivers,channels at the same time???"},{"instruction":"Are Yamaha motorcycles reliable for a new biker?","output":"I think Yamaha bikes are the best and most well built bikes.

If you have sensitive skin, you may want to dilute the aloe vera gel with water before applying it to your face, or look for a product that contains a lower concentration of aloe vera. Additionally, if you're using a store-bought aloe vera gel, make sure to check the ingredients list to ensure that there are no added irritants or chemicals that could potentially harm your skin. It's important to note that while aloe vera gel is generally safe to use on the face, it's not a cure-all for all skin concerns, and you should always consult with a dermatologist if you have any persistent skin issues or concerns."},{"instruction":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","output":"A ‘good leader’ in what area of life? A good leader in war is one that can mislead a group of people to believe that the greater good over-rules individual good for both sides. The leaders soldiers should be willing to die and they should be willing to kill. A good leader in business (for the business owner) finds the top 20% of performers and fires the lower 80%. A good leader in religion is able to create a belief among followers that they are weak and unworthy - but have a sliver of hope if they have faith in what that religion teaches. A good leader in education (for the institution) produces the largest possible financial gain for their organization under the guise that degrees are what makes the world go around. A good leader in government (for one party) is the one that can hold power even when they only have a minority support. A good leader on a hike is one who can read the limitations of people in their group in order to keep them safe while providing a great experience. A good leader as a Human Being is a person that sees each person for the perfection that they are. They create the space for people to become their personal best. We can choose to be led by the needs and greed of government, religion, education or business or we can choose to follow our own gut instinct that we are all born with. ‘Good’ leaders are defined by the number of followers but that doesn’t speak about the quality of the followers. Is there such a thing as a good follower - beyond the reverse definition of each class of good leader? For example a good follower in war is prepared to kill and to die. For a person that becomes their personal best, are they a follower or have they become a leader in their own right? In that case a good leader is one who expands and strengthens diversity of leadership. It could be argued that a follower in war is a leader of sorts. The question is whether war is natural or unnatural. For the answer we look at nature. Does war exist in nature where tribes of a species seek to kill each other? That is unnatural. it doesn’t exist. So with war being an activity that goes against nature, so to, the leaders and followers are engaged in an unnatural activity that is allowed through free will. The real question could be what makes a good leader bad or good?

Many Pakistanis here are cherry picking bad pictures of Bangladesh and good ones of Pakistan. Forgetting that both nations have different demographics and people plus the land area and density. Truth: Bangladesh has better economy than Pakistan, better currency than Pakistan. Pakistan’s infrastructure may slightly be better than Bangladesh’s because while Bangladesh was part of West Pakistan, they looted the resources and used it to modernize West Pakistan, not the East. After independence Bangladesh had to build itself from the scratch. Pakistan gained independence 72 years ago; while Bangladesh gained independence 48 years ago. There has been a drastic improvements in Bangladesh since then; while there are many internal tensions in Pakistan. Bangladesh as a nation is under construction. So one can’t assume which is better and which isn’t. Both countries are at different level. Bangladesh and Pakistan has their own good sides and bad sides. Only the ultra nationalists will show the good side of their own and the bad side of other nation. For couple of years now Pakistan is doing really bad, their currency has taken a dip and their entire Nominal GDP is reducing or in stagnant position. On top of the debts of Pakistan covers a huge chuck of their entire GDP , hence little money left to spend on social welfare. Plus, the inflation rate is high hence the value of PKR is going down, which is taking effects on their GDP. On the other hand, Bangladesh managed to handle it’s money properly, stable inflation and less external debts. Down Below are the stats of each country: Pakistan Area: 881,913 km² Population Density: 255.3 people per square kilometer (661.1/mi2) Bangladesh Area: 147,570 km² Population Density: 1,115.62 per square kilometer,(2,889.45/square mile), Pakistan currency is lot weaker than Bangladesh. Pakistani Rupee is in a free fall. You can see below: Bangladesh maintains highest gender equality in South Asia , ranking 48th. Way ahead of India as well. Bangladesh government promotes gender equality and encourages women to join the workforce alongside men. Bangladesh government spent its money on social welfare such as on building better infrastructure and providing good education. Even in the Literacy rate Bangladesh is higher; Bangladesh: 73% and Pakistan: 58%. This way people, regardless of gender and class, can get their education and help to move the wheel of Bangladesh’s economy. Bangladesh’s population was higher than Pakistan, but now you can look below: Pakistan population: 216 million (2019) Bangladesh population: 163 million (2019) So to those Pakistanis, who is busy saying progress in Bangladesh isn’t as significant and all that let me tell you sincerely that Bangladesh introduced birth control methods as early as 1980s, within few years after independence. Population of Bangladesh and Pakistan in 1970 were: Bangladesh has fewer population than Pakistan + life expectancy rate is higher + lower fertility rate than of Pakistan. So admit it, that even after being independent for 70 years, you guys aren’t doing so well. Whereas Bangladesh who gained Independence from Pakistan 48 years ago doing so well. Life Expectancy Pakistan: 67.79 years (2019) Life Expectancy Bangladesh: 73.57 years (2019) Coming to natural beauties of each countries. Both has their beautiful places. That’s something not to brag about, its all made by the mother nature and not by the people themselves. So it is better to respect the nature regardless where it is located. Here are some beautiful places of both nations. Pakistan: Naltar valley Neelum Valley, Azad Kashmir Gojal Valley Bangladesh: Jaflong, Sylhet.

Firstly, physical appearance and strength are not always the most important factors for success in military operations. Elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo rigorous training programs focusing on functional fitness and endurance rather than just building muscle mass. They must be able to perform various tasks, such as carrying heavy gear, running long distances, and swimming through difficult conditions, which require different training than bodybuilding. Secondly, elite soldiers and Navy SEALs undergo training designed to help them perform their jobs effectively and efficiently rather than bulk up. Having too much muscle mass can sometimes hinder their line of work, as it can reduce their flexibility and agility, which are important for navigating difficult terrain and executing complex maneuvers. Finally, it's important to remember that genetics also influence how our bodies respond to training. While some people can easily build large amounts of muscle mass, others may need help achieving the same results, even with the same amount of training and nutrition. Therefore, it's only sometimes possible or practical for everyone to achieve a bodybuilder-type physique, even with intense training and dedication."},{"instruction":"What different styles of photography are there?","output":"Oh, come on, your having a joke with this question aren’t you.

What is the highest wind speed in which a plane can land?","output":"There is no single maximum wind limit, as it depends on wind direction and flight phase. A crosswind of over 40 mph and a tailwind of over 10 mph can start to cause problems and stop commercial aircraft from taking off and landing. A crosswind can be very dangerous during takeoffs and landings. An angle formed between the wind and the center line of the runway is defined as a crosswind. And there are limits to that component, as well as to tailwinds. Each aircraft has its own established crosswind limitations. Consequently, the maximum acceptable crosswind component is 25 knots. An aircraft has its own movement force, which will always be affected by the wind component regardless of the size or weight of the aircraft , the difference will be the speed with which it moves and therefore the time that the wind affects its movement. motion. For a takeoff or landing to be done safely, the ideal is for the wind to be calm, with a headwind or with a very weak tailwind. While crosswinds or tailwinds can limit maneuvers and be dangerous, since they can move the aircraft sideways and cause instability and loss of control. One of the wind components that pose the greatest risk during takeoff or landing maneuvers is the so-called crosswind, which is perpendicular to the runway and directly affects the direction of the aircraft. During these maneuvers, crosswinds can occur in the form of gusts, gusts, or shear. Being able to generate abrupt and sudden changes, excess speed safety margins and an alteration in the aircraft's ability to accelerate and climb or reduce and descend. Being, therefore, more dangerous the closer to the ground they occur. Aircraft, according to the characteristics given by their manufacturers, have a limitation regarding the crosswind that they can face when landing, which can go, on average, between 25 km/h to 55 km/h.

So with that in tow and for the fact they pull their shit of trying to turn you into the ideal person as if that movie titled stepford wives, or the other the husband of stepford. The worse I saw was a middle aged female, she had fainted it was a co Ed ward the nursing staff left her laying on the floor walked right around her as if she wasn't even there, those fuckers did not even check her vitals. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT. So what I did being the loving and compassionate male I am, even towards total strangers, I approached 2 other male patients and requested their help to get her off the floor and into her bed, we got screamed at by one really mouthy nurse to which she was instructed to SHUT THE FUCK UP BEFORE WE SHUT YOU THE FUCK UP. And we got the patient who fainted in her bed and all tucked in. When she came to about an hour and a half later she was confused a little, asked the nurses what happened to which them dumbass dickwads losers didn't say a word. We told her come on over and sit with us, we'll tell you what happened and who all was involved. The other really bad thing was they dragged some male into this locked room it was always locked, me being nosey when someone did enter it I saw it had no bed or furniture in it. They chained him to the floor and left him there, MY GOD he was sitting with the rest of us watching TV he didn't even so much as saying boo to anybody. Afterwards male nurses would enter one always stood at the door when it was unlocked, and we heard cries of pain coming from that room. What was going on, the nurses were kicking the life out of him, kicking him in his side, his crotch even in his head, when he passed out from the pain out the nurses came and the door was locked.

This would save the money and make things easier than having to paint or remake uniforms and equipment every time they pick a new war. Those nice desert tan vehicles don’t blend very well in green areas any more than green blends in the desert. The problem is, as every grunt knows, the area you are in changes ever few klicks. Plants die. You have to work to stay hidden. So, what works in one area probably won’t work in another that changes altitude or humidity. Even in Vietnam, were the ERDL pattern was developed, we had two variants. Highland and lowland. The lowland was more green as it was more lush. Where I live, we can go from summer with ERDLl to fall with ERDLh and then Alpenflage to a nice brown in winter if not white based. The foliage changes with the seasons. If I go 100 miles north, it changes, just like south. Even in the same season, I can go from woods to fields, towns, and more, all requiring different changes in camo to blend in. But, the digitals I’ve seen are just horrible. Greys and blues especially. Good riddance.

And you might already know that have so many forms and types, such as pure perfume, cologne, and eau de toilette, etc. Sounds exciting right, but have you ever wondered what’s the difference between these forms and types? Well, all fragrances are almost the same when it comes to the texture, but they’re slightly different based on the concentration and consumption of oil in alcohol and water. Well, so many experts explain that “the fragrance” is a term for the use of Unisex purpose, and any smell that contains a certain amount of oil in alcohol and water. For Example- The difference between Cologne, Perfume and Eau de toilette 1. Cologne (eau de cologne) – It is an ancient term to describe Eau De Cologne and the oldest term for perfume, often used for masculine fragrances. The smell is very subtle, fresh and florescent, typically contains two to four percent of oils in alcohol and water. 2. Toilette (eau de toilette) – It is relatively lighter than the other perfumes and colognes, it is a version of a scent that contains a lower percentage of fragrant essential oils than Eau de parfum and cologne. 3. Perfume (Eau de parfum) –This form of fragrance is genderless, and it is often used to describe both men’s and women’s scents which are [LINKED_TEXT: unisex fragrances] [URL: https://www.perfumebooth.com/unisex-perfume]. Usually, it contains about 15 – 20 percent of pure fragrance essence and it lasts for about four to seven hours. 4. Perfume –This one is the most concentrated and expensive of all the other options.

It can last up to 24 hours."},{"instruction":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","output":"If you've seen his movies you will know that Rohit Shetty doesn't really believe in gravity (refer to the flying scorpios and goons in, well every single one of his movies).

Overpowers crocodiles Reaction speed: Dodges an energy beam. From Yeti attacks Durability: Tanks a smack from a power-gem amped Thanos. Tanked from being slammed into the snow. Is unaffected by the cold despite being a frog. Tanks a punch from a yeti. Power and abilities/hax: Creates a tiny rainstorm to follow a criminal. His lightning creates a smoking crater. His lightning creates a small explosion. Sets a Yeti with a miniature fire. Electrocutes an alligator. Has a telepathic connection with Thor. Creates a portal to Asgard.

Yes, I know. Can it get worse? I could tell you about the time ICP came in after a concert one night, how little jerks would come in and throw a ROLL of quarters into the jukebox and force us to listen to Cher’s I Believe all night long, or how customers tried to knife me because I wouldn’t let them eat Wendy’s in the store. But those are too easy. I mean, it was FLORIDA. Stuff like that happens all the time. The scariest and weirdest customers I had were two little old ladies. They had these deathly pale faces and their poofy little old lady hair was dyed dark brown. They had these long teeth and each wore matching magenta lipstick that feathered into the wrinkles above their lips. They looked like cannibals and freaked me the heck out! But they came in every day and ordered the exact same thing. EVERY day at the exact same time in their little polyester pantsuits: a raw steak, charred on each side (I mean really burnt!)a glass of Pepsi with half and half poured in For those who aren’t American or otherwise in the know, half and half is basically creamer. Half cream, half milk. In their soda. With the raw steaks. They would eat this stuff and their plates were covered in blood as they gnashed away with those loooong teeth of theirs.

His decision was utterly idiotic from all possible points of view. It killed thousands of well paying jobs on both sides of the border. It angered Canada and caused major political problems for Canadian liberals including Crime Minister Trudeau. It increases imports of heavy oil from Russia and Venezuela to the expense of American families. So why would “President” Biden do something that stupid? What does he gain from a lose-lose situation? Surprise!!! “Caring Joe\\" did it for dirty, capitalist money. As it stands, for the lack of pipeline, the oil will have to be shipped by RAIL. And who invested heavily in the railways to profit from that? One Warren Buffett. So, screw the American families, screw the environment (railways are a lot more environmentally harmful than pipelines), screw nation's strategic implications!!! As long as Warren Buffett is making money and sharing in his “good fortune\\" with the Democrats. That will also bring us to the larger question, ie. why big corporations support the Democrats rather than the Republicans - an apparent paradox? Simple answer. The Republicans support free competition and competitive economy ultimately benefitting the American consumer. The bigger the corporation, the more it hates competition and strives for monopoly, so it can rip off the consumers. That is why corporations support Democrats. They figured out long time ago, that the Democrats are more corrupt than a hooker on the street corner, hence much cheaper to buy and own and if you grease them properly, they will sell their own country. Just ask comrade Xi why he greased the Biden family to the expense of America. So, 80 million Biden supporters - enjoy Biden's “presidency\\" and expect more to come!!!"},{"instruction":"Can a doctor place a woman in a temporary coma under anesthesia so she doesn't feel the pain of labor during childbirth, and if this is done, can the woman give birth while unconscious?","output":"No. First of all the drugs to do this would be very bad for the baby. Secondly, a woman needs to push to get the baby out. I understand that you are scared. We all are when we face childbirth. You can see a psychologist about it. Hypnobabies classes are also helpful because they help you know what to expect and give you tools to help your mind be sort of elsewhere even if your body is not. ."},{"instruction":"What piece of evidence do we have that reproduction of humans on Earth started with two people?","output":"None… Well… in the strict sense of evidence meaning “ facts presented in support of a proposition”… the people proposing that human reproduction began with exactly two people are usually the followers of an Abrahamic religion, and they present, basically, the fact that the Book of Genesis all but says this in so many words as the evidence. Unfortunately this is such weak evidence that it is as good as no evidence at all … possibly worse (since it potentially undermines the authority of their religion to use the book that way). Therefore it is known as “no evidence”. BY comparison there is plenty of evidence that human reproduction emerged from a general population over time. By the time there were identifiable distinct H.sapiens, there was likely a breeding population in the millions. The way evolution and species works the ancestral chains looks like this: If you were to line up your mother, and her mother, and so on in a long line … you would eventually end up with an animal clearly not a human. Most people get this part … it’s the next part that gives people trouble, vis: There was no disjoint moment where a non-human mother gave birth to a human daughter. At every single individual along the line, mother and daughter to that individual are the same species. You can see it by analogy with a color gradient. Open up your favorite image editor (Photoshop, The GIMP, whatever) and use the gradient tool to make a bar starting with red at one end and blue at the other end. If you zoom in to the individual pixels anywhere on the gradient… pick a pixel… the pixels to either side of it are the same color, yet the pixels at each end are clearly very different colors."},{"instruction":"Do they have stereotypical American food restaurants in other countries, and do they serve any American foods that aren't actual American?","output":"Not counting fast food, yes.

I have never had restaurant ramen, nor been to Japan to try it at a ramen shop there, so my choices are experiments I have done at home with various ramen packs. When using the Nissen Ramen I prefer the Oriental flavor, but use half the packet at most. I will add some broth mix, or Miso, then add some seasoning like rice or black vinegar, or some chili oil or other pepper sauce. I also like adding Schezhuan peppers for it's taste and tingle. I may add Terriyaki sauce, soy sauce, or hoison sauce depending on the flavor I want. The toppings mostly depends on what I have available. I rarely have roast pork but one time has an extra country style pork ribs that I sliced and put on top. Carrot sticks are a good choice, but I am not a fan of eggs so much, so I haven't put boiled egg on it, but want to try it with medium boiled egg, still sort of runny yolk. One thing I do at times is use the noodles with half the broth, some peanut butter, and Terriyaki sauce, topped with sesame seed to make a variation on sesame noodles. I recently found an Asian grocery that I can find different oils, sauces, vinegars and spices, there I found a selection of satay peanut sauces I use instead of just peanut butter. I think it is Thai, so it gives an extra kick. To me Ramen is like pizza, it is just the base for the final product. You can put on most anything you like."},{"instruction":"w can I learn a dance?

Exciting yet nerve-wracking, right? Well, here are a few tips to help you navigate that potentially awkward but hopeful encounter. First things first, be yourself! Yeah, I know it sounds cliché, but it's true. Pretending to be someone you're not won't get you very far. Plus, who wants to start a relationship based on lies? Next, remember to relax and have fun. It's natural to feel a bit anxious, but try not to let it consume you. Enjoy the experience, laugh, and let your genuine personality shine through. And speaking of shining, don't forget to dress comfortably and appropriately. Be stylish if you want, but also consider the venue and the activities planned. Communication is key, my friend. Talk, listen, and show interest in your date. Ask questions, share stories, and find common ground. Remember, it's a two-way street, so let them speak too. Oh, and please put your phone away. Nothing screams disinterest more than constantly checking your messages or social media feeds. Now, don't worry about trying to impress your date with extravagant gestures or an over-the-top dinner. Keep it simple and focus on building a connection. A cozy coffee shop or a casual stroll in the park can work wonders. And hey, if the conversation is flowing smoothly, feel free to suggest extending the date with another activity like grabbing dinner or catching a movie. Lastly, be respectful and considerate. Treat your date with kindness and show good manners. Open doors, offer compliments, and be mindful of their boundaries. Oh, and don't forget to follow up afterward with a text or call to let them know you had a great time. It's a small gesture that can go a long way in making a lasting impression. So, there you have it! Just be yourself, relax, communicate, and have a good time. Remember, the ultimate goal is to enjoy each other's company and see if there's a spark worth pursuing. Good luck, my friend!"},{"instruction":"Was the Galactic Empire in Star Wars the largest and most powerful empire in scifi?","output":"No, not even close.

I’d wanted one for a very long time and had read all I could put my hands on, which wasn’t a lot before the internet! If I knew then what I know now I realize what a poor choice this was, especially for a first dog. We learned a lot together and determination of future pet adoptions were based upon that learning. Because she was pure bred, her breeder required I wait until she had her first cycle before I could spay her in case he decided he wanted to breed her. I won’t ever do that again. Always spay your females before their first cycle. Her behavior immediately after her spay did something weird to her hormones and brought out her Alpha behavior in many ways. I won’t bore you with the details. Huskies need exercise. A LOT of exercise. Destructive behavior ensues when your dog is bored or not “worn out” from exercise, This is exemplified 10x over with a Husky. Digging, tearing up shoes, eating underwear, biting a hole in the waterbed (!). If an Alpha Husky growls, it will bite. Let it growl. We thought teaching her not to growl would stop the snap-biting. It just made her snap without warning. My son got nailed twice, me once. (Some would say that would be the end of the dog. Our pets are family members.) Huskies are bred to run, and run hard. They will take any dog siblings with them that will go, and they don’t stop. We lived near the university sheep pastures at the time. A sign gave strong warning that “at large dogs would be shot on sight”. It was imperative we keep her fenced. I was always scared to death they’d escape and get shot. Fortunately that didn’t happen, although it so easily could have. Once we had to pay a fine and pick her up from the Humane Society. Many trials of fencing (a VERY large yard) failed until we put electrical wire at the top and bottom of the fence (who knew a dog would CLIMB a fence!). Worked great, except…enter a contractor that leaves the gate open. The last time she and her adopted sibling (Husky/Heeler mix, go figure) got out, we were driving out of state and had left them in the care of my daughter and boyfriend. Thankfully after hours of worrying, we got the call that they had been caught about 5 miles from home. We eventually moved out of state, installed a buried electrical fence that worked very well. (Side note: People, if you install an underground electrical fence TRAIN your dogs and train them well!) Best solution ever. I wouldn’t give up the years I had with this beautiful creature. She became the coolest, most mellow old lady and lived to be 16 years old. But she sure was a challenge for a first dog."},{"instruction":"US wars after 9/11, who is on the losing end, the West or the Muslim terrorists?","output":"The Bushes (owe their wealth to the Saudis) set the US up to defend the biggest enemy of the west and freedom of expression.

What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","output":"Ok the main reasons Britain had the largest empire the world has ever known. Britain, traditionally on the edge of the known world, was a technologically backward, damp group of islands that nobody was concerned about. Populated by barbarian tribes that had nothing to do, but farm and kill each other over an insult or land or inheritence laws for most of its history.Because britain was isolated, poor, backward damp and the people that lived there fought each other over nothing, the catholic church had little authority over the kings, leading to prodestantism, and an influx of educated men whom held ideals that opposed some of the ideals of the church. That created a culture of learning not for the sake of learning like the Greeks, but learning about God’s creation for the sake of gloryfying Christ.The British had always been divided, which made them good fighters always at war with each other. (The only thing the white man has ever been better at then anyone else at is killing each other over stupid reasons. No empire has ever controlled all of europe, and noone has built an empire that controlled most of europe for any longer then a few years)The British were poor, they were slow to send ships to the new world. They couldnt afford it. Scotland is actually a part of the UK today because their attempts at a colony in the Americas failed and sent them broke. England bailed out the Scottish economy in return for Union. The English beginings of colonialism in the new world was piracy. They raided Spainish colonies and treasure fleets.Because they were slow to set up colonies, poor, had a different approach to education, were distracted with politics within the British isles they were able to watch what and how other powers set up and ran colonies, and profited from them.The British set colonies up for profit. The government or parliment had nothing to do with it. Parliment allow corporations and private enterprise do the colonizing not the state. Politicians, Lords, and even the Crown invested in these companies and enterprises. Men like Francis Drake and William Jardine, invested and became politicians after successful enterprises.India was conquered by a corporation not the British army or the Royal navy. That act made Britain rich, which paid for more ships for war and trade which led to world domination."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"SindhuTai She adopted 1042 children.

In the early months, as your baby's immune system develops, you'll want to use the mildest cleansers and the smallest bit of lotion. But when dry skin, eczema, and diaper rash appear, it's time to treat those problems. Talk to your pediatrician about when to start using those products. Your newborn needs dye-free, fragrance-free baby skin care products. Read labels carefully. Baby skin care products that contain dyes, fragrances, and chemicals can irritate a baby's skin and breathing. Natural baby skin care products are safe for most infants. But if you have allergies or asthma in your family, your newborn may also be sensitive to botanicals and herbs in some products. The label hypoallergenic can be misleading. The term means that the product is less likely to cause an allergic reaction, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the product is gentler on the skin than other products. Look for products that are phthalate- and paraben-free. Those chemicals are potentially harmful to babies. Cleansers and washes are mild and safe for newborns. But use baby soaps sparingly, as they can dry newborn skin. Helps moisturize newborn skin. Use sparingly on tiny newborns. Can be used to treat diaper rash. It provides baby's skin with a protective barrier against moist diapers. You may be asked to apply it to the healing circumcision site.

As a nazi-praising, tariff-raising, anti-NATO, anti-American president, he set the bar as low as it could go. He’s a president who largely did nothing while 500,000 Americans died of Covid—except pretend there was no such thing as Covid. As a leader and a person, Mr. Trump is somewhat of an abomination. Could Clinton Do Better? Could Mrs. Clinton do better than ‘the worst’? It’s unlikely she would do worse. She understood how the U.S. gov’t worked. She had foreign policy experience. She was sensitive to the challenges of children and the poor. She practiced etiquette and had a sense of decency. In these things, she was positioned to be a better leader, better steward, and to better serve the country. So, of course, she had the intellect and temperament to do better. Easily so. Would she be successful? That’s different though than saying she would have been successful. With the exception of Don Trump, she was the most negatively viewed politician in America. I think if she would have won—she would have faced unprecedented challenges including some form of obstruction and disinformation: The senate, led by Sen. McConnell, was prepared to block her agenda—just as he had done against Mr. ObamaShe would have had a hard time confirming judges to the Supreme Court.With GOP majorities in both houses of congress, she would have had a VERY difficult time passing significant legislation Having Said That There ARE things she would have accomplished: Stronger NATO: Trump divided NATO and the U.S.’s standing across the world plummeted. Clinton would have worked better with foreign allies.Russia faces consequences: Russia DID tamper with our elections. If elected, Clinton would have called them out and punished them. Not bowed down at their feet. She would have also had the world’s support (See #1)Different tariff policy: Clinton’s tariff policy would have likely been different. Tariffs are paid for by Americans in the form of higher prices for goods/services. Clinton would have saved each U.S. family about 1,000/year.Covid: While there’s no way to say that Clinton would have reacted faster, she would not have pretended Covid didn’t exist either. I think we can say that the U.S. response would have been more coordinated, less expensive (agencies not bidding against each other), and we would have provided more leadership worldwide. Trump gets credit for developing the vaccines…but otherwise, his Covid response was a failure and is largely the reason he lost re-electionNo praising Nazis: Clinton would not have excused Nazi behavior. Nor stoked it. As a result, many of hate groups (Proud Boys etc.) would be much less powerful and less a threat to the countryFunctioning Gov’t: Trump left many vacancies in many departments…basically crippling them and making them unable to function. Most notably, the U.S. Post Office, the I.R.S. and the State Department. Clinton would not have impaired basic government functionLess Corruption/Graft: No administration is corruption-free, but Don Trump’s was the most corrupt in our history…by far. Along with his family’s self-dealing, he had the most corrupt campaign staff, the most corrupt cabinet, and the most corrupt administration. Worse than Nixon. Many went to jail, were forced to resign, or were ethical failures. Trump’s family used the positions for personal profit.Less disinformation: Clinton would have faced disinformation from Fox and Facebook…but she would not have stoked it, energized it, and made authoritarianism a tool in the playbook.More stable America: If Clinton had won in ‘16, much of the destabilization of our country by Trump (Jan. 6 and the anti-democracy members of the GOP) would not exist…or at the very least been delayed by 10 years or so.Better immigration: For 20 years, America had its lowest levels of immigration into the country. Then Trump lied about there being a crisis and set up detainment camps…Unnecessary. With Clinton, immigration is actually dealt with—more effectively and without traumatizing kids and embarrassing the nation Verdict Much of Clinton’s positives would have been addition by subtraction. Maybe she doesn’t have a ton of legislative or judicial accomplishments, but she does help the country side-step the disaster that was Don Trump. She was competent, knew and respected our history, and would have strengthened our foreign relationships. She’s not perfect. According to reports, she can be indecisive and vindictive.

In the event your brakes are cut without you knowing somehow, you'll want to downshift and apply the parking brake but not all the way or you can lock up the rear tires unintentionally. If you're driving a manual then you know how to downshift but in an automatic, look at the options on your gear lever. On my Ford Ranger, I've got P, R, D, 2, 1. Some will have a 3 or maybe even a 4 additionally. If you are going like 40–50 mph and you realize the brakes don't work, pop the gear lever into 2 and slowly apply the e brake, you'll slow down faster than you think. When the revs get too low, pop it into 1 and give it more e brake and hopefully you'll stop in time. Good luck to you if that happens."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","output":"If you are a beginner and you have just started learning basic Data Structures and Algorithms then this answer is for you. Most people out there will begin answering this question by telling you to make an account in Codechef, Codeforces, or some other platform. It’s okay to some extent but definitely, it won’t help you in the long run if you are an average guy. Let me summarise all the steps and precautions that you should always keep in mind: Choosing a language is an independent decision, but for competitive coding, it’s better if you go with C++ or Java.As a beginner, your whole emphasis should be on LEARNING and PRACTICE. You should participate in CONTESTS only when you are done with your milestones for LEARNING and PRACTICE.You must keep in mind that throughout your CP career you need to maintain a ratio for LEARNING TIME, PRACTICE TIME, and CONTEST TIME. The order would be:LEARNING TIME >= PRACTICE TIME > CONTEST TIME (Beginner)LEARNING TIME = PRACTICE TIME >= CONTEST TIME (Intermediate)LEARNING TIME < PRACTICE TIME <= CONTEST TIME (Advanced) There are numerous youtube channels that will definitely help you in your learning progress. It’s recommended that you learn through watching videos as it will provide faster progress.For beginners, it’s strongly recommended that you start practicing from HackerRank. HackerRank has a very user-friendly UI. You only have to implement the function that will do the job you have been asked. Although, you should avoid sticking to HackerRank for much longer. As soon as you think that you have conquered the fear of writing codes and got comfortable with your thought processing, you should stop using it. You should visit it when you learn a new concept and want to implement it.Now it’s time to focus on practicing. GFG and Leetcode are highly recommended places for practicing. GFG is the encyclopedia for competitive coders and Leetcode contains almost every standard question that you will face while learning DS and Algorithms. Although you can practice on CodeChef, Codeforces, or wherever you want. You should also start participating in contests by now, but keeping the following points in mind.Always try to read and try developing an approach at least if not the complete solution for every problem in the contest.Go through the editorials after every contest. It’s really important because it will help you in developing the skill of reducing a complex problem into a simple problem.If you are not able to understand the solution, then there are numerous YouTubers who stream their solutions. Refer to those videos. In the end, it’s all about practice. It’s about how much familiar you make yourselves to the question so that when you see a familiar question next time, you would be able to recognize it. If you think that Competetive Coding is all about developing your logic and problem-solving ability then you are wrong, it’s a lot about memorizing the type of the question and developing the ability to identify when you see a similar one again. And you can develop that only by practice and facing varieties of different problems."},{"instruction":"What are some examples of arguments against the existence of an afterlife?","output":"How can you argue faith?"},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"A 14-year old child hung herself from the shower rod with a bed sheet.

Will I die or severely hurt myself if I smoke cannabis while on 30mg of Vyvanse?","output":"Yes, it’s gonna make you feel really good. Too good, it can be (extremely) addictive, if the amphetamine is still active, so avoid weed when youre drinking and peaking when on vyvanse or adderall as that can lead to a rocky road. If it does help your sleep and adhd symptoms, a slow therapy can help, as you build a light tolerance and that can counteract addiction, since the “high” isn’t as euphoric. it works extremely well with alcohol too, a peak with adderall/vyvanse, cannabis and alcohol can cause intense euphoria as it synthezises and builds a triangle-like high. Be cautious with it, the shit is just too good. It’s probably not far of what meth would feel like. (im just guessing, but it’s probably comparable) Meth is the most addictive substance on earth, for many people, it even beats heroin once youre into it and youre creating a comparable feeling. I’d imagine it works something like this: Vyvanse can’t reach peak-levels comparable to meth, which is why it’s so much less dangerous. (aderall CAN and works faster, which is why i think it should only be used for heavy adhd but what do i know) With weed, i’d imagine that “protection” goes straight out the window, due to intense dopamine-blood-levels, especially when combined with alcohol. Be prepared to be so addicted that you potentially cant stop using for years. Weed is extremely strong when destroying thought loops, as it makes you feel extremely numb, but still conscious, a feeling of all your negative emotions being completely numbed, which is also an intensely addictive thing. it can make you feel MUCH number than alocohol can even at relatively high dosages and if you combine the two. Alcohol makes you forget everything, but weed+alcohol makes you remember the intense eophoria and numbnessness, carelessnes to all your deepest worries. My god, don’t do it. It’s just way too good. I haven’t smoked in years and i still deeply, honestly very much so miss the feeling, as it truly can treat and even cure adhd like nothing else can.

For being captain, For debates, competitions, organizing events, anchoring, writing, sometime studies too. And I started these things from 6th standard. To be honest No one liked me. Not even my so called best friend. I was always considered the odd one out. The main reason was jealousy and arrogance towards me. And it increased after SOTY trophy! So, I left school with no actual friends, who used to show that they are my friends. . And I know as I have seen this normally, one day when you actually become successful and big, people start needing you or maybe the financial help from you. The same faces who turned their back, now are ready to kneel down! Actual success brings a lot of people around you. Because you start earning money and fame when you are adult and successful! And that what matters more than anything. . The only advice I would like to give is, In your teenage don’t be so mean to someone better that you. The person you left in jealousy or arrogance Can be the same person who could have been you best friend forever. Can be the same person from whom you’ll have to ask help in need. Can be the same person who can be so heartless that they will not even recognize you. Teenage is pretty normal stage to be jealous of someone better than you, but don’t ruin friendships. Because till the time you realize, it might be very very late. . PS- I am 3rd category person, I don’t recognize anyone.

However, there is also a certain element of bias and emotion in choosing one school over the other. It can be difficult to account for all these factors in making your decision about which school or type of school is best for your child. Many parents want to send their children to private schools but are afraid that they won't get a good education. This is a bit confusing as most people don't know the difference between public and private schools. There has been much comparison about private schools and public schools, whether it be the teachers, education system or the curriculum. Private schools are very useful in improving a child's grades with various levels of difficulty from math to history classes. For decades, many families have chosen to send their children to private school. Some choose to do so for financial reasons, others for the extra curricular activities.

Andy Dufresne being raped by Bogs Diamond could also be a source of inspiration for negative memes. Anything can be spinned and flipped from good to bad. It is harder once it is established, but it can be done. How many opportunities for making fun or negative spinning are offered in IMDB Top 100?

Subject wise analysis and type of preparation you can think ofStudy Techniques I have used during preparationRevision Techniques I have used during preparationWays to tackle Test SeriesWays to tackle previous year questionHow to incorporate standard text books during preparation Subject wise analysis and type of preparation you can think of Aptitude :- Aptitude in GATE not so difficult compared to exams like CAT and other. There will be about 10 questions of aptitude, a normal student would able to attempt around 9 questions find and might feel little hurtle to attempt one question but, with little consistent practice you would be able to attempt that one question also. What to with respective aptitude…This is not just my advise, it a common statement from all the toppers to dedicate 1hr for aptitude from day 1 of your preparation until the exam day.If you think you are great with aptitude during your last days of preparation you can think of practicing alternative days.Make sure you solve all the previous year papers. Mathematics :- I am from mechanical background so, from my perspective I can break down this subject into 2 distinct categories.Common preparation point about mathSome problems might be easy focus on the tougher ones the one which you fail. practice all the problems at least twice. If you got the answer still skeptical about the topic please go back and understand the topic.No matter how fearful about math you are math itself would constitute majority of the weightage in gate so, in no way you can ignore it must and should you should learn.If you find the model typical make sure you try to tinker the values given in the question and play around with the problem and make yourself comfortable with the problem concept. Engineering Mathematics consists of linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability statistics. These three subjects are common for many branches of engineering not just computer science so if you open previous year papers of computer science you would find around 300 to 500 problems in Linear algebra and calculus and 300 problems in probability alone so all together around 1000 problems.Learn the concept then practice previous year problems, by practicing the previous year problems for these three subjects would be enough since, for Mechanical and civil people the questions would asked in depth. Discrete Mathematics consists of Graph Theory, Set theory, Propositional Logic and CombinatoricsGraph Theory learning the concept and doing previous paper is a must, the question is asked for chromatic number of regular graph of 6 vertices (K6) you would get the answer but please don't leave the problem there, you yourself take the remaining type of graphs and adapt the question. like…..what is chromatic number of circular graph?….what is chromatic number of wheel graph?….what is chromatic number of bipartite graph?……I would like explore the question this way and take the given values to its minimum and maximum and explore and understand the concept especially for graph theory. Make sure you practice previous year question twice in graph theory.Set Theory one of the easiest subject, relation is most scoring part, don't ignore lattices dedicate special time for lattices so that if a question comes from lattices you should not miss it. Practice previous year questions twice from set theory also.Propositional Logic In no way you should miss this chapter, because no matter how tough the question is everyone who so ever is writing gate will never leave a question from this topic. In fact, this chapter don't need any lectures also. You just need lot of practice in this topic. The more you practice this topic the better you get at it. As usually practice the previous question paper twice. This particular chapter our lectures have taught us as way of solving the question by disproving the options rather than searching for the right option. This kind of approach really works.Combinatorics There is lot of scope to ask tricky questions here. The only way is to tackle the topics from this subject is to segregate them.1. De-arrangement 2.Combinations 3.Permutations 4.Combinations with repetitions5.Permutations with repetitions6.pigeon hole principle 7.functions8.many more minute topicsAs I am concerned, if I was able to segregate the problem to which topic this belong to then I would try to solve the problem with the concerned formula. Most of the time I usually get the right answer Digital Logic :- Don’t even dare to loose a mark in this subject (if the model is repeated).Counters is the most stressed topic.Remember the circuits of half adder and full adders and other important, you should be able to draw them when ever requiredPractice more than 20 problems of K mapDon’t ignore digital codes and conversions (BCD, grey..etc…)Most tricky part is 2′ complement. Computer Organization and Architecture I have no idea why all computer science people consider it as most difficult topic. For me its a fun oneRead Carl Hamcher for each topic. Line by Line and understand the way in which the author is looking at the subjectPipeline and cache is the most important chapters, I would ask you to do previous paper at least a 5 times from Pipeline and cache.When it comes to secondary memories, be sure you are using right formula and your calculations are rightInstructions and addressing modes read it as many times as possible you will get a grasp of itRemember, if a hard problem is given from this topic, its not just tough for you, its tough for AIR 1 too.. Programming in one word pointers.. pointer it is pointers… pointer… pointer… are you hearing me or not ….. pointers it is….Solve as many problems as possible from pointersThis is only subject you need to use your computer for. Don’t just solve the problem on paper. You should code the same exact thing in the computer and make sure you are getting the same output there.Would like to listen to a cheat code here, I am giving you the best cheat code for this subject, If you have good IDE for C you are most welcome to debug the code, keeping track of live variables and checking is your working on the paper matching with debugging.Recursion is place where tricky question are given, 30% of people won’t attempt it and 30% would get the answer wrong So, I think you know which part of percentage you are suppose to be …..In the final exam, I am in the 30% which you got the answer wrong, I made a mistake in indirect recursion I got AIR 7 if I would have made this question right I would have been AIR 3 … So, now you know what kind of questions are game changers….. Data Structures Practice problem a lot … from this chapter it’s not only for GATE, I would be useful for Interviews too..Stacks and queues… you need to be well versed with the code. There are many standard questions with respective stacks and queues you need have those questions on finger tips.Binary Tree…. rather than remember the formulas try to take examples and disprove the options given in the question.Make sure what is being asked is itBinary TreeSkewed Binary TreeComplete Binary TreeFull Binary TreeBinary Search TreeHeapMin HeapMax HeapAVL TreeThere is a lot of difference between all of these.. most of the time mistakes are made like, if asked binary tree in the question we would interpret as binary search tree… Be sure you are answering what is asked for…Graphs… Have a great clarity on DFS and BFS … you need to know differences,code and applications of DFS and BFS… there are hundreds of questions that can formed only with these two topics. Algorithms even though this one of the subject you need to be good at I am not well equipped with the subject So, I would only write about what I knowMake a cheat sheet of time complexitiesWhen ever you are reading about a standard algorithm… make sure you are in a position to analyse about time and space complexitiesWhen questions are given based on notations make sure you don’t miss them …. those can be the easiest questions from this topic.Dynamic programming is not just for GATE, its highly required for Interview.Minimum Cost Spanning Tree and shortest path are such topics which is appearing in every year GATE paper. Not understanding and not practicing it will be a blunder.Practice more… Corman seamed little high standard for a mechanical guy like so I followed everything from sahani. Theory of Computation Overall Idea about this subject is highly important. When a question is given in this area you should be able to distinguish boil it down to the specific sub sub topic it belongs to, either DFA or DCFL or CFL or CSL or Recursive or TM, Segregating which particular sub concept the question paper setter is trying to touch itself is a game changer.Construction of DFA is a must (this is one of the easiest topic In which I lost marks I am not proud of it).Differentiation of CFL and DCFL … have a great clarity on it.There is nothing more important that closure properties…. I will give you another cheat code here…. Instead of remembering what all closure properties hold for what all languages…. Insted remberWhat are closed for all langsWhat are not closed for all langsWhat are not closed for regularsWhat are closed for DCFLwhat are not closed for CFLwhat are not closed for RecursiveWhat are not closed for REL Undecidable read it from peter Lintz, remember standard problems of undecidablility…Have a matrix for each lang(y axis) and each problem (x-axis) and filling decidability or undecidablity in the cells.If you want to dig deeper have a fine distinction of Recursive, Semi decidable and Not REL’sFor turing machine and halting turing machine, remember all the problems … In exam under pressure you might get confused. If you have understood well enough you can solve it in the exam. Pumping lemma… people ignored it that no question is coming from topic since ten years … all of a sudden there was a question in 2019 … guess who solved the question… the ones who didn’t ignore… It hardly takes an hour to learn and practice this topic. Compiler Design :- touch this subject only after you are done with TOC or when TOC is going on….Have a clarity on various types and sub types of parsers. Initially categorize into Top down and Bottom Up parser then categorize into remaining parsers, when a question is asked you write down on scribble pad about what parser you are solving the question for.Syntax Directed Translation.. do all the previous paper question 4 times… the question paper setter really can’t confuse you here… only your computations and interpretation matters.Understand the distinction between L-attributed, S-attributed, Inherited attributes and Synthesized attributes.Don’t read the dragon book line to line… only refer it when are stuck at a particular topic. Operating System one of the toughest subjects of all time .. but with right techniques and tactics can be made into a easiest subject of all time.Read GALVIN Line to line, you are most welcome to read it twice. (only required chapters don’t read the whole book).In CPU Scheduling problems, Most of time, most of the people, make a computational mistake. Your computations are highly important in this particular subject.Short tricky and theory oriented topics like inter process communication and synchronization should never be skipped. Read and practice all the codes required. Properties like Bounded waiting, Progress and Mutual Exclusion are of deadly importance.Concurrency is a topic such that if you dedicate 5hrs to understand and practice it you will surely attempt the question and get it right if the question appears in final exam.Deadlock … just a concentrated 10hrs preparation and practice is enough 2–4 marks are in your account. It is one of the easiest topic in OS.Virtual Memory …. practice harder problem in this topic .. there had been a gradual trend of problems becoming harder and harder year by year… and there is an increasing hardness in this topic… I lost marks in this topic just because I didn’t practice harder problemsPaging… draw diagrams even if it is not required and redundant …. diagrams in paging would give a you a great clarity. Have a good distinction between all types of paging. For example, can you answer as of now difference between Segmented Paging and Paged Segmentation……? can you…?File systems and disk scheduling …. again there is no way question paper setter can trick you … only possibility of going wrong your computations. Databases.. its free given marks, if a question is asked from this subject. One of the biggest technique in this subject is (if you have a little time) solve the question by taking sample database and discarding options.ER Diagrams, don’t you dare solve the problem without putting pen on paper. Never do it with your eyes. Please do write down tables with primary keys underlined on paper then and only then you answer the question.Relational Algebra and tuple calculus…. there is a lot of scope of harder problems being asked from this topic so, practice more. One tactic is (if you are good with SQL) writing equivalent SQL query, sometimes it might work, it might not work. Take sample database and discard options. Don’t search for right answer instead, eliminate wrong options.SQL…. you should have practiced SQL before in some project or other. This is only best way to master it. If you have not done it there are tutorials on internet to practice SQL please do that. Unless you have experience writing SQL queries before , its very hard to solve the problems.Indexing…. your computations are at most importance …. models are being repeated in this topic for years….. only way you loose this question is if you don’t practice or make a computational mistake.Transactions and concurrency control…. Serilizability is the only topic you need to understand good and make sure you identifying the conflicts right. Computer Networks ….. having a little more syllabus that usual subjects… but with repeated revision you can handle this subject..Read forouzan for the topic that are there in the syllabusHave a great understanding of layers, gives you a over all idea about the subjectFlow and Error control.. practice previous problems and make sure you make no mistake in computation. Have in mind what exactly being asked in the questionRouting… if you spend 3hrs on this topic you can sure shot attempt this questionThere are only five application layer protocols given in the syllabus it might take only 2hrs to read about each one of themIf the question paper setter want to ask a logical and computation intensive question from this subject only area he could touch cryptography. There are only a handful of cryptographic algorithms to be learnt and it hardly takes 3hrs to learn and practice each one of them.Learn front and back of TCP, UDP and difference between them.Finally Most important, Most Expected Untapped Area Questions to be asked on toipcs are WIFI and IPV6. These topics have been included in the syllabus 3–4 years back but not a single question is posed on them so, you can expect question from these topics. I have only commented on most important thing with respective every subject, it is to be noted that every topic in the GATE syllabus is important and every topic in GATE syllabus is worthy of question being asked from. I have given you main points but, no topic to be ignored. Study Techniques I have used during preparation Most of my study techniques won’t be any different from any topper but still I would like to list out for your reference Pomodaro is how I used to count study hours daily. A detail explanation is given in my talk about pomodaro and if you google about this study technique you would get a lot of information about this technique written by scholars. I have used a app called Flat Tomato [LINKED_TEXT: ‎Flat Tomato (Time Management)] [URL: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flat-tomato-time-management/id719462746].Everyday post class I would revise what ever taught in the class and I used to redo whatever problems taught in the class.Never skipped a class. Due to dengue fever I had to skip 1 week classes then after in order to recover those classes I have to go to management take a letter and attend those classes in some other batch.Used to write notes in the class. These coaching lectures notes are complied and easier version of Standard Textbook. The soft copies of these notes are available online.Wrote short notes to all the subjects. Instead of making short notes smaller version of normal notes, I tried my level best to make my short notes contain a list of my mistakes.Solved Previous Paper twice, but I would advise you solve it thrice.Practice ACE Academy material, The material is good but there are lot of typos in it , It’s not only case of ACE Academy, Everyone’s material in the market have lot’s and lot’s of mistakes ). Anyway, its up to you to solve the material, there is nothing you would lose by solving the coaching material.Test Series ……… one and only way to evaluate yourself. Believe me, there is no other way.There are many more study techniques I have given in my talk including techniques like pomodaro, it comes around 17:41. I have given a link to my talk at the end of answer. If you want to know a little more about my study techniques I have written in another answer also I have written the way to use the study resources………[LINKED_TEXT: Phani Madhusudhan Thontepu's answer to What was your GATE (CSE) preparation story?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-was-your-GATE-CSE-preparation-story/answer/Phani-Madhusudhan-Thontepu?ch=10&share=13ae2926&srid=npmQz] Revision Techniques I have used during preparation.. My Vajrayudham (greatest weapon) was spaced repetition. See, there is no need for this particular techniques to help you in your preparation. I am saying it helped me I might or might not help you. Spaced repetition was only for revision, remembering and retaining purpose, I have done it in two phases. To describe……Learning Spaced repetitionThis used to go with classesEvery day what ever taught, came back home and read those what ever taughtWhatever problems taught in class, I used to do it back on the same day in the evening.Then yesterday topic revision.Then one week back revision.Then one month back revision if necessary (usually I sometimes skipped it because I didn't have time) Revision 1 Time Spaced Repetition (What you actually see in the photos I have attached)Noted down late date on which topic is completed.Form last date, 1 week after I wrote date then, I used to study whole subjectForm last date, 15 days after I wrote date then, again I used to study whole subject.From last date, 1 month after I wrote date then, again I used to revise whole subjectFrom last date, 2 months after I wrote date then, again I used to revise whole subject (this only I used to do for hard subjects, you can find the date in compiler design and computer networks) See techniques are to bound to you, you are not bound to techniques, please mould them as per your requirement. The ultimate objective is to learn subject and attain marks. Every time I take a test, If some question has gone wrong, I used to take a look at that topic from short notes this used to be a kind of mini revisionTest are a kind of revision .. during taking of a test.. your mind would be concentrated on retrieving a topic .. this would stress you brain and neurons patterns which have learnt the topic would be reinforced which helps the subject to be retained betterI have given a clear explanation of my revision strategy “Forgetting curve and Spaced Repetition”. In my talk, It comes around 8:32. I have given a link to my talk at the end of answer. Ways to Tackle Test Series doesn’t matter how good you are, You need to take test series. The one and only way of evaluating yourself is through test series. please do enroll in at least 2 and at most 3 test series. Don't over whelm yourself in enrolling in more than three test series. Make a schedule on how to attempt the test from test series and follow schedule carefully. Don't get demotivated when you secure a very low score in test series and overconfident if you score well. This is the one and only way to evaluate yourself. My testing schedule was different, Instead of telling you what I did for testing I will tell you what I think is best for taking test. I would ask you to take a look at test series, you would find 25m test (30 min), 50m test (1.5hrs) and full length test. Don’t delay giving tests, thinking that after I have completed all my studies I would be giving tests.I would advise anyone to take 25m test as soon as they are done with studying the topic (Let it what ever month it is), as soon as you think you are done with the topic please try to attempt 25M test that would given you an idea about how far you have learnt the topic, you can also analyse how good you have learnt the topic with respective to GATE.I would advise anyone to take 1.5hrs tests during their revision times in the month of October and November. This will give you an idea of what your weak topic and what your strong topic as are, you would encounter models now repeatedly, this would tell you what all models you need to be thorough with.I would advise anyone to take 3hrs tests during the last few months before test, namely December,January and Feb. This would tell you where you are lying and what all you need to improve at and how to tackle the actual exam.See, the 3hrs test thing, various toppers have various perspective on it, some say you need to give full length test every week from the starting of preparation and there are many more views on full length test, I gave you mine. Ways to tackle previous year questions at least 3 times every single question There was a time when solving previous GATE questions was enough to get a reasonably good rank but, times have changed. If you actually see through the past 5 years question papers, I think you will find new questions appearing every year and question being asked from untapped areas. So, there is huge possibility that you might miss these questions if you are only solving PYQ’s. While solving previous year gate questions, please keep these in mind…. If a model is appearing more than once, this is only indication that its a important model. By tinkering the values given in the question make sure that you know this model front and back.There is no certain year from which you need to practice the questions from why would I say this because there has be n number of instances where a model resurfaced after many years. Examples…In Theory of Computation, There was a question on pumping lemma in 1990's then after there was never a question on that topic, again one question appeared in 2019 paper.In computer Organization, There was question about gates to register function while execution of instruction, I still remember that topic in coaching classes was taught but not with much emphasis (because questions stopped coming from that topic since last ten years) but, when I was solving PYQ's I came across this model and even though it was a model of 1989's I still spent an hour reading that topic from carl Hamacher (it was not in detail in the notes). My luck had its way, a question from exactly that topic appeared in GATE 2020. If you have committed mistake while working out a PYQ, make sure you mark it and solve it later point of time, by later point of time I don’t mean in the evening or 2 hrs later, because you will remember the mistake, solve it after a week then if you didn’t get the mistake again you got the concept right, if you committed the same mistake again then you are fooling yourself saying that you understood the topic.If you repeatedly making mistakes in a particular question, take the reference book read that topic and learn the topic again from the scratch. You should have a mistake tolerance for PYQ’s (no of times you can acceptably get wrong answer to a question). How to incorporate standard text books during preparation do not ignore standard textbooks. The list of standard text books are going to be same there are not going to differ from topper to topper. I would like to list of my standard textbook list for only those subject which I read….Computer Organization - Carl Hamacher (only difficult topic)Operating Systems - Galvin (read line to line)Computer Networks - ForouzanAlgorithms - Sahani (only required Algo’s)Theory of computation - Peter Linz (if and only if I didn’t understand the topic)Databases - Korth (only for certain chapters)Compiler Design - Ullman (only for a couple of parsers)See there are lot more standard textbooks in the market if its recommended by a professor they are goodThe way you need to read a standard textbook is different, you can’t just read it like a newspaper, In other answer, I have explained in detail about the way to read a standard Text book [LINKED_TEXT: Phani Madhusudhan Thontepu's answer to How do I read a standard textbook effectively?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-read-a-standard-textbook-effectively/answer/Phani-Madhusudhan-Thontepu?ch=10&share=f308fd53&srid=npmQz] Most of the techniques during preparation which are to be stressed a lot are given in my talk … Finally, what ever I wrote above are my personal opinion and my advises, it up to you to follow these or there is no necessity that these will be true for your case too. A little boasting of my preparationThe pens I have kept track of from day 1 to final exam day, My study rack, consisting of Standard text books, notes, Rough notes and other books I read for fun…. Hope this helps :-)Madhusudhan"},{"instruction":"w realistic is a Thorium based nuclear reactor?","output":"They're perfectly realistic, we have built them after all. There are advantages and disadvantages of using them. For example thorium can't be used in existing reactors, which means we can't simply switch from uranium to thorium without massive investment into refitting existing power plants. On the other hand, thorium can't be used to make weapons grade nuclear material, so would prevent or at least reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. I think we'll eventually build commercial thorium reactors, but for the moment there's little economic value in doing so.

It primarily consists of quartz, feldspar, and mica, with other minerals present in smaller amounts. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock formed from the recrystallization of limestone or dolomite minerals under intense heat and pressure. It is predominantly composed of calcite or dolomite minerals. Appearance: Granite typically has a granular and speckled appearance due to the interlocking crystals of different minerals. It comes in a wide range of colors, including various shades of gray, white, pink, black, and even blues and greens. Marble often exhibits a smooth and veined appearance, with distinctive patterns and swirls caused by impurities and mineral deposits. It comes in various colors, such as white, beige, gray, green, and black. Properties: Granite is known for its durability and hardness, making it highly resistant to scratches, heat, and chemical damage. It is commonly used for kitchen countertops, flooring, and outdoor applications. Marble is softer compared to granite, making it more susceptible to scratches, etching from acidic substances, and heat damage. It is commonly used for interior surfaces, such as countertops, flooring, and decorative accents. \\"JK Stone\\" is mentioned in your question as a [LINKED_TEXT: natural stone manufacturer in Bhopal, India.] [URL: https://jkstones.in/natural-stone-manufacturer-in-bhopal/] As a manufacturer, they likely specialize in sourcing, processing, and supplying various types of natural stones, including granite and marble, for construction and decorative purposes.

This unique quality of honey is attributed to its chemical composition and the conditions in which it is stored. Honey has a relatively low water content, typically ranging from 14% to 18%. Bacteria and other microorganisms require a higher water content to grow and multiply, making the low moisture level in honey unfavorable for their survival. When microorganisms are exposed to honey, the water present in their cells is drawn out through osmosis, effectively dehydrating and killing them. In addition to its low water content, honey has a relatively high sugar content, primarily consisting of fructose and glucose. Sugars act as natural preservatives by reducing the availability of water for microbial growth through a process called \\"osmotic pressure.\\" The concentrated sugar solution in honey creates an environment where microorganisms are less likely to thrive. Furthermore, honey has an acidic pH level, typically ranging from 3.2 to 4.5. The acidic nature of honey further inhibits the growth of bacteria and other spoilage-causing organisms. This pH range is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of most microorganisms. To preserve honey's longevity, it is crucial to store it in a sealed container in a cool, dry place. Exposure to heat, moisture, and air can degrade its quality and potentially allow for microbial contamination. When stored properly, honey can remain edible and retain its flavor and nutritional properties for an indefinite period. The discovery of jars of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs, still in an edible state after thousands of years, is a testament to honey's remarkable preservation qualities. It serves as a fascinating example of the natural resilience of certain substances and their ability to resist spoilage over extended periods of time."},{"instruction":"Which angel is more popular, the Angel Michael, or the Angel Gabriel?","output":"Chriss Angel?

We’ll include some of those on the list, but we’ll start with other “investments” that are also important for your long-term wealth. Top Off Your Emergency Fund Risk level: Low If you don’t have a fully-funded emergency fund), this should be your top investment priority. According to a well-publicized 2018 survey from the Federal Reserve, four out of 10 people wouldn’t be able to cover even a small 400 emergency in cash — and that was well before the pandemic even started. If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that your entire financial life can be upended overnight. When that happens, your emergency fund is literally your financial lifeline. A good place to keep your emergency fund is in a high-yield savings account. A savings deposit account lets you easily access that cash. It’s also recommended to keep some of it in cold, hard cash — say, 500 or 1,000 — in case of an emergency that shuts down the electrical grid (and ATMs with it). The only downside to this approach is that right now savings accounts aren’t paying a lot of interest. On the flip side if you keep some of your emergency fund in cash at home, it won’t pay any interest at all and you run the risk of losing it or having it stolen. Nevertheless, having an emergency fund in some form or other is a non-negotiable for financial stability. We recommend you check out CIT for your online savings needs. Hire a Financial Advisor Financial advisors can perform many different roles in your financial life. If you really couldn’t care less about how your investments are managed, hiring a financial advisor might be your best choice. They are available to manage your investments and answer your questions throughout the entire process — of course, this is usually the highest-cost option.

You don’t need to choose one option at the expense of all of the others. You can choose bits and pieces from this list: use a bit to top off your emergency fund here, buy some index funds within your IRA there, and so on. Ultimately, you’ll need to decide which of these choices is the best use of your extra cash, based on your short- and long-term goals, But to avoid much loss in the market, you need to have a professional analyst like Victoria Grace Lindsay managing your portfolio.

If you are struggling with the same issues, here are few helpful reminders: 1. Their opinions are not paying your bills. - The biggest realization you can have is that your family is depending on you to make your business/career/life successful. You have bills to pay and mouths to feed. There is no shame in paying your bills through a legitimate, legal business or Job! 2. Is this EVEN true? Ask yourself this daily. - Did someone actually say this or are you making it up in your head? 3. If they don’t support you, they’re not a true friend. - A confident, happy person will be cheering you on. If they’re not, don’t waste your energy worrying about it. 4. They’re not ready yet. - Very rarely does someone become successful overnight. Gary Vaynerchuk and Ankur Warikoo put out content for so many years before they became well known. Some may not understand the benefit of your product/service quite yet. Keep marketing and growing your business and serving your audience because they will get it eventually and may come back. 5. YOU have to live with your decisions, not them. - As Rachel Hollis says, “Don’t let someone in the cheap seats have an expensive opinion on your life.” As you know, 90% of start-ups fail within 5 years. So being an entrepreneur is supposed to be hard! You must be confident and have thick skin. Stay consistent, keep putting yourself out there, and believe in yourself!

Angular, a popular open-source framework by Google is written in Typescript. It helps developers to create web apps. The front-end developers use frameworks like Angular for manipulating and presenting data efficiently. Besides this, Angular comes with new versions very often and the new versions are much more efficient than the older ones. What is Angular JS? AngularJs is a top Javascript-based open-source framework used by front-end development companies to create single-page web applications(SPAs). This framework is continuously expanding and growing. This means that the developers keep getting better ways to create SPAs. It has the capability to change static HTML to dynamic HTML. In addition to this, Angular comes with features like dependency injection and dynamic binding. Difference between Angular and Angular JS in terms of: 1- Mobile support Angular supports mobile. AngularJS does not support mobile. 2-The architecture of Angular vs AngularJS Angular is a framework that uses components that are directives with templates. Two kinds of directives in Angular are Attributive and Structural directives. AngularJS is a framework that has a model-view-controller (MVC). It acts as the central component as it manages the logic, data, expressions, and rules of the app. 3-Performance and Speed Angular is a framework that is upgraded to a better structure and this enables it to offer improved performance and speed.

The small ones are 2–3 bottles worth, and break down into nothing. You can chop them with scissors and take those out with the bag in your pocket and cardboard box taped around your body, under a shirt. Plus, boxwine is what someone would get for a party, or strategic alcoholism; getting a 5-day jug, every day from different stores. That doesn’t solve the problem of the bottles you already do have, of it you just love your one brand. Level 1; Juvie style. If the person you need to get past is in a back room, drop the bottles out a window, and pick them up to put in the next bin, or throw in the ditch if you must. You can also start drinking a lot of soda, so the wine bottles just happen to get thrown away, still in the big garbage bag. Just trying to save face, this works well enough. Pro-level is replacing beer cans in the soda case. Level 2; Spouse’s side-eye. You can find a way to wrap it in laundry, a toolbox, gym bag and get it from the attic hiding spot to the car. Build a pile behind the shed that gets too big to move. An advanced delinquent skill is holding things against one’s chest in a coat, through the coat pockets. Don’t take Ritter’s lesson this time and do allow some leeway because hiding your front at all costs is a dead giveaway. Level 3; Failing rehab. You go back to jail if they bust you in the halfway house. That’s when you make a sacrifice. Those bottles are going in someone’s shoes or hanging clothes’ pockets. They’re getting chucked in the crawlspace, inside the recliner. Will you get caught? Of course, but you got away with drinking one more day, and that’s all that matters and is a clear definition of “having a problem.”"},{"instruction":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","output":"I don’t think so.

And this same Bean Bag, I’ve bought for Rs. 99/- and today I’ve got the delivery also. Now do you think Flipkart fooled me by selling me the same Bean bag at Rs. 99/- when they are selling it for Rs. 854/- in normal days? Here is the SS that I’ve bought it for Rs. 99/- This is just an Example. There are so many items that are came into an Insane Price this year.

If you want to know which people are closest to Early Medieval Turks both culturally and genealogical, than it are Kazakhs (and Kyrgyz), partially also Bashkirs, Karakalpaks, or Yakuts. As a whole, Kazakhs were those people who lived the nomadic life in the territory of Kazakhstan. Kazakhs were those people who always remained “true to the heritage of their ancestors” and did not revert to a settled form of life. Of course, the Uzbeks, Turkmens, Tatars, Uyghurs, etc. are also Turkic peoples. But in terms of continuation of our ancient culture, we Kazakhs are far closer. Tuvans can be regarded as Turkic source population, representing the earliest stage of Turkic nomadic peoples. Finally, an extensive study of the genetic legacy of the Turkic nomads across Eurasia based on autosomal dna analysis reveals that the source populations for the Turkic nomads who spread 'Asian genes' to non-Turkic peoples were (the ancestors of modern-day) Tuvinians, Mongols and Buryats, despite the fact that the latter two are Mongolic (Yunusbayev et al. 2015).81 In sum, one should note that the early eastern Turkic peoples were in all likelihood genetically closer to their neighbouring Mongolic peoples than to various later Turkic peoles of central and western Eurasia.

It forms from the cooling and solidification of molten magma deep within the Earth's crust. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock that originates from limestone. Through intense heat and pressure, the minerals in limestone recrystallize, resulting in the formation of Marble. Appearance: Granite and Marble have different appearances due to their distinct mineral compositions. Granite often features a speckled or mottled appearance with a variety of colors, including shades of gray, black, white, pink, and green. The individual mineral crystals in Granite contribute to its unique and textured look. Marble, on the other hand, typically exhibits a smoother and more uniform appearance. It is renowned for its veined patterns, which can range from subtle to bold. Marble is available in various colors, including white, gray, beige, and even vibrant hues like green and red. Durability: Granite is known for its exceptional durability, making it highly resistant to scratches, heat, and stains. It is a popular choice for kitchen countertops and high-traffic areas. Marble, although beautiful and elegant, is softer and more porous than Granite. It is susceptible to scratches and can be damaged by acids, including those found in many household cleaning products. Consequently, Marble is often used in areas with less wear and tear, such as bathrooms, fireplace surrounds, and decorative elements. Maintenance: Granite requires minimal maintenance and is relatively easy to clean. Regular sealing can help enhance its stain resistance. Marble, being more porous, requires more maintenance. It is essential to seal Marble surfaces regularly to protect against staining and etching. Additionally, Marble surfaces should be cleaned with gentle, pH-neutral cleaners to prevent damage. Application: Both Granite and Marble have a wide range of applications in construction and design. Granite is commonly used for kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, flooring, and outdoor paving. Its durability and resistance to heat make it suitable for kitchen environments. Marble, with its elegant and luxurious appearance, is often used for bathroom countertops, wall cladding, flooring, and decorative features like statues and columns. It adds a touch of sophistication to any space. Cost: In general, Granite is more affordable than Marble. The price of both stones can vary depending on factors such as color, quality, and availability. However, Granite tends to be more cost-effective due to its widespread availability and durability. Marble, being a more luxurious material, is often more expensive. In summary, Granite and Marble differ in terms of their composition, appearance, durability, maintenance requirements, applications, and cost. Understanding these differences can help you make an informed decision when choosing between the two for your specific project or design needs."},{"instruction":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","output":"How about boosting your productivity with the most used tools?

I remember the first boat show I went to there was a really nice sailboat there for 5 million. IIRC it was around 70 - 80 feet long. It had a Jacuzzi on deck in front of the mast, a double curved stairway to the main salon, a crystal chandelier and all sorts of other niceties. To me that seemed like a super yacht. A few years later I went to a boat show where there was a big power boat. It had twin diesels and a separate cabin for the captain. Oh yeah, it also had a dance floor, a bar, perhaps 6 or 8 staterooms, a helipad, davits for a 30 foot motor launch and quarters for the 10 crew and other officers. The twin diesels were each 12 cylinders (or maybe 16?) and were each almost 10 feet high. The ‘yacht’ was over 200 feet long and had 3 covered decks not including the open decks on top. So which was the super yacht? The 5 million sailboat or the unknown-priced power boat? Without a definition of ‘super yacht’ there are so many variables that it’s really impossible to answer. Power boats (big or small) use a lot more fuel than sailboat which by definition don’t use much fuel because they’re sailing. I haven’t spent more than about 10 in fuel in a year for my sailboat while I know people with powerboats 2/3 the size who burn over 200 of fuel per weekend. Of course my boat engine is diesel which is a lot more efficient than a gas engine but as a sailboat I only use the engine coming in and out of the dock on almost every trip. So is your super yacht a power boat or a sailboat? And is it gas (petrol) or diesel? It makes a huge difference. Do you need a crew or can you handle the boat yourself? Obviously if you need a paid crew you have to add a reasonable salary per person. Are they live-aboard or is it just a day job? Is your super yacht 70 feet long or 210 feet long? Most marinas and yacht clubs charge by the foot so 210 foot long boat will nominally cost 3 times as much to dock as a 70 foot boat - except that not every harbor can handle 210 foot boats so there might be a premium for docking spaces that long. What that means is that instead of paying say 2 per foot per night for a 70 foot boat you might pay perhaps 5 per foot per night for a 210 foot boat - much more than 3 times. But where is that dock? Costs for a luxury location like perhaps Marseilles, France will likely cost more per foot than a not-so-luxurious spot like perhaps Anchorage, Alaska. Is the boat in salt water or in fresh water? Salt water corrodes the metal parts on a boat a lot faster than fresh water, the topsides as well as under water. Are you in tropical waters with intense sunlight beating down on the woodwork or a temperate climate where it’s not nearly as harsh? But then in tropical areas the boat can stay in the water all year round whereas in northern climates the boat may have to be hauled for the winter. There’s lots of other variables as well. Is the boat fiberglass, wood, steel, aluminum, ferro-cement? How much woodwork is there? I could keep naming them off but the main point is that the question is too vague to answer."},{"instruction":"What is the most shocking substitution in a football match?","output":"05/07/2014, Netherlands v Costa Rica, Due to 0–0 scoreline in the full time, the game headed towards the extra time.

DON’T DO IT…….UNLESS you like hefty repair bills that FAR EXCEED the pittance you’re going to save by running inferior octane gasoline!!!! High octane fuel is rated higher by the fuel’s ability to resist detonating. in other words, 93 octane fuel is less apt to pre-ignite than than 87 octane…..The fuel’s ability to resist igniting prematurely is HUGE! In a high compression engine, low octane fuel ignites BEFORE the spark plug fires simply due to the higher pressures/temperatures created by a high compression of forced induction (supercharge or turbocharger) which creates WICKEDLY increased cylinder temperatures and pressures….ESPECIALLY if detonation occurs!!! The reason you’re engine has a high octane requirement is due to the compression ratio, induction method etc. The engineers who developed this engine KNOW what they’re talking about! When you run a lower than recommended octane, you’re almost certainly creating detonation (look it up) which essentially means the air/fuel mixture is igniting, due to heat from high compression/forced induction, which creates a separate “flame” and the two “flames” collide with each other. In other terms, you’re creating excessive pressure and heat which not only causes “pinging”, it very well can and will cause burned valves, burned pistons (I can’t tell you how many times I tore an engine down to see holes melted in the top of the piston(s)….. On modern, computer controlled engines, your ECM (computer) is going to detect the “knock” created by “pinging”. this immediately results in retarded ignition timing, which this alone will dramatically reduce the power output of the engine, causing you to depress the gas pedal even harder, compounding the situation because the detonation will worsen according to engine load/RPM , forcing you to go harder on the gas which is going to wipe out any savings at the pump b y dramatically reducing your fuel mileage. I can go into the engineering behind this, but all but the most educated people aren’t going to understand what I’m saying anyway…so i am not going to waste my time to type it out. I tell my customers BEFORE THEY BUY A VEHICLE to RESEARCH items such as “vehicle requires PREMIUM fuel”, minimum 91–93 octane as this is not put on the vehicle for anyone’s health, other than the person buying the car. IF YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO RUN THE PROPER FUEL, YOU CAN’T AFFORD TO OWN THE VEHICLE!!!!! I CAN’T EXPLAIN THIS ANY BETTER…and I don’t say this to be “mean”. I’ve been a MASTER tech for over 30 years now….and trust me, the old adage “You can pay me now or pay me later”….either way matters not to me. I make a hell of a lot more doing heavy engine repair than i ever will maintaining your vehicle.

Paganism is an umbrella-term. Another fine colonial-era invention. It used to mean Europeans that practiced folk religion, then they started tossing all polytheistic worldviews into the bag. If you want accuracy, you’re going to have to compare Christianity to each worldview called ‘pagan’. I believe Buddhism is ethically superior to Christianity. I believe one wouldn’t have to look very close or far to make that deduction. I acknowledge though that not all polytheistic religions and philosophies seem ethically superior to Christianity. I don’t think it’s ethical or conducive to the end of suffering to have blood games and human sacrifices like the Meso-Americans did> just for example. Christians like to accuse ‘pagans’ of things they made up themselves sometimes. Like saying ‘pagans’ go to Friday Sabbats to sacrifice babies and children to the horned-god. The fact of the matter is, most polytheistic societies were strongly family-oriented, and those kinds of accusations are propaganda bunk. Many of the notions we today value concerning humanism and virtue came from the Greek philosophers.

Top 10 Importances OF On-Page SEO in Digital Marketing: 1. Keyword Research: * The act of finding the precise words and phrases that people use while looking for information, goods, or services on search engines is known as keyword research. It is an important aspect of search engine optimization (SEO) and helps website owners and marketers understand the language and topics their target audience uses. * Identify relevant words and phrases that people will probably type into a search engine when seeking information about your website. To locate high-volume, low-competition keywords, use keyword research tools. Here are some steps involved in keyword research: * Define your goals: Determine the purpose of your keyword research. Clarifying your goals will help you focus on relevant keywords. Brainstorm topics: Start by brainstorming broad topics related to your business, industry, or niche. Think about what your target audience might search for when looking for information related to your offerings. * Use keyword research tools: Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz's Keyword Explorer for keyword research. These tools provide data on search volume, competition, and related keywords. Enter your brainstormed topics or seed keywords into these tools to generate a list of potential keywords. * Analyze keyword metrics: Review the data provided by the keyword research tools to evaluate the potential of each keyword. Look for keywords with a high search volume, low competition, and relevance to your business. Consider long-tail keywords (phrases containing multiple words), as they tend to be more specific and have a higher chance of conversion. 2. Title Tags: Each page should have a unique and descriptive title tag that includes the primary keyword. Keep it within 60 characters to ensure it displays properly in search engine results. An HTML element called the title tag is used to specify a webpage's title. It is displayed on the browser's title bar or tab, and it also appears as the clickable headline in search engine results pages (SERPs). In addition to its SEO value, the title tag also serves as a crucial element for the user experience. It helps users quickly identify the content they're looking for when browsing multiple tabs or bookmarking pages. 3. Meta Description: Write compelling meta descriptions that summarize the content of each page. Although meta descriptions don't directly impact rankings, they can influence click-through rates from search engine results pages (SERPs). A meta description refers to a short HTML attribute that provides a concise summary or preview of the content of a web page. It is typically displayed in search engine results pages (SERPs) as a snippet below the page title and URL. 4. Heading Tags: Properly structure your content using heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to indicate the hierarchy and importance of different sections. Use relevant keywords in your headings to signal the topic of the content. Heading tags are HTML elements used to define the headings or titles of sections within a web page. They provide structure and hierarchy to the content, allowing both users and search engines to understand the organization and importance of different sections. * In HTML, there are six levels of heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest. 5. URL Structure: Create clean and descriptive URLs that include relevant keywords. A well-structured URL makes a website more accessible to users and aids search engines in comprehending the page's context. * The term \\"URL structure\\" describes how a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the address used to find information on the internet, is organized and formatted. The URL structure is composed of various components that help identify the specific webpage or resource and its location within a website. Both consumers and search engines should be able to easily read and comprehend a well-structured URL. It should ideally include relevant keywords, reflect the website's hierarchy, and be human-readable. A clear URL structure can improve the overall user experience, help search engines index and rank the website's pages more effectively, and make it easier to share and link to specific resources. 6. Content Optimization: * Produce original, valuable material that is of the highest caliber and relevance to your audience. Incorporate target keywords naturally into the content, headings, and meta tags. Several techniques can be employed for image optimization, including: * Compression: By eliminating extra data and compressing the image data, one can shrink the file size of an image. There are lossless and lossy compression methods, with lossy compression providing higher levels of compression but potentially sacrificing some image quality. * Resizing: Scaling down the dimensions of an image to match the required display size can significantly reduce its file size. This is particularly important when displaying images on smaller screens or mobile devices. Format selection: Choosing the right image format can contribute to optimization. JPEG, PNG, and GIF are popular formats that each have their own advantages and ideal applications. For example, JPEG is suitable for photographs, while PNG is ideal for images with transparency. 7. Image Optimization: Optimize images by reducing file size, using descriptive file names, and adding alt tags. Alt tags provide text descriptions that help search engines understand the content of the image. * The technique of lowering the file size and enhancing the quality of photos on websites or other digital platforms is known as image optimization. It involves various techniques and strategies aimed at reducing the file size of an image without significantly compromising its visual quality. 8. Internal Linking: Internal linking helps search engines discover and navigate your site, improving the overall crawlability and indexing of your pages. * Internal linking refers to the practice of linking web pages or content within the same website. It involves creating hyperlinks that connect one page to another page on the same domain. 9. User Experience (UX): Internal linking refers to the practice of linking web pages or content within the same website. It involves creating hyperlinks that connect one page to another page on the same domain. These links, which can be text- or image-based, are frequently included in the body of web pages. * Ensure that the website is user-friendly, simple to use, and loads rapidly. A positive user experience can indirectly impact search engine rankings, as search engines prioritize sites that provide a good user experience. 10. Mobile optimization: Mobile optimization typically involves various techniques and practices, including: Responsive design: Creating a flexible and adaptable design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations This ensures that content remains readable and accessible across a range of mobile devices. * Fast loading times: enhancing the website's or app's functionality to load more rapidly on mobile devices, as these consumers frequently have poorer internet connections than desktop ones. This involves minimizing file sizes, optimizing code, and leveraging caching techniques. * Touch-friendly interfaces: designing user interfaces that work well with touch inputs like pinching, swiping, and touching Elements like buttons, menus, and forms should be appropriately sized and spaced for comfortable interaction on touchscreens. Simplified navigation: Streamlining the navigation structure and menus to accommodate smaller screens and limited space Mobile-optimized websites often use collapsible menus, hamburger icons, or prioritized content to improve usability.

I love some of the answers here and Jim White hit the nail on the head! There is evidence of life after death, or an afterlife…plenty of it. The problem seems to be that no one does any research on it. They just repeat what others have said, which is “There is no such thing”, yet they have zero experience to base that on. I’m not going to talk about a religious afterlife. To me, that’s a bunch of hooey, made up to make people feel better and act accordingly. First, it is not a proven fact that our consciousness resides strictly in the brain, contrary to what someone else here wrote. We don’t completely understand consciousness and there are several theories regarding consciousness not being entirely a brain function. So, that excuse is out. Regarding paranormal events (like ghosts, etc) there actually is a lot of evidence that “something” *is going on with unseen and/or seen apparitions. The problem with this evidence is that it’s easy to dismiss and can’t be repeated in any sort of scientific manner, although people are trying and making some headway. Photos, videos and evps can all be faked, so skeptics would rather just throw the baby out with the bathwater. It’s unfortunate there are people who think it’s funny to fake these things, b/c it just muddies the waters for serious researchers and of course, ruins any chance of being taken seriously. I’m sure there are a lot of people rolling their eyes by now. To that, there’s nothing I can say to change their minds. Just because they haven’t experienced something doesn’t mean it’s not real. The one thing that keeps me going, of my research, is an EVP that a friend and I got one night. We were all alone in the country at an old church at night. I had the tape recorder going and said something to the effect of “If anyone is here, please say something”. We got an immediate response of a man’s voice. He sounded like he was in an echo-y area, sounding differently than my voice on tape. He said “Are you listening?” The word “listening” went up in tone as if for emphasis. And the fact was, we weren’t listening or paying attention. We just figured nothing would happen, so we didn’t even check the tape until weeks later. There is no mistaking the man’s voice, there is no mistaking he replied directly and in context to the question, there is no mistaking the fact that no man was present or anywhere within miles of us. At this particular church we had a lot of inexplicable incidents that I haven’t written about yet, but this one is a solid example of a disembodied voice responding to me. Of course, no one else will take this as evidence b/c they weren’t there, etc, but I know it happened. I’m not a gullible person and I have done a lot of research in this subject. There is a lot of misinformation out there by supposedly legit ghost hunting shows that also works against any serious research, but that’s life."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","output":"what is the difference between perfume and cologne Perfume Perfume, also known as Eau de Parfum, is the most potent oil concentration. Typically, a bottle of perfume has an oil concentration of 20%. Any perfume user will find that the fragrance they choose will last from morning to evening. But as the days go by, the smell fades. Fragrance should be present at full strength for 6-8 hours. This is the longest lasting of all types of perfume. Due to the high concentration of oil, perfume is usually the most expensive option. Also, people with sensitive skin often choose perfumes because they are lower in alcohol and therefore better for the skin. The low alcohol content does not dry out the skin as much and causes much less irritation for people with sensitive skin. In most cases, perfumes are aimed at women. cologne Cologne, also known as Eau de Cologne, is a type of fragrance with a much lower concentration of fragrance than perfume. A bottle of perfume can contain 2-4% concentration of fragrance. This is why it is much cheaper than perfume and lasts about 2 hours. The defining feature of Cologne is its frequent use of traditional recipes or ingredients, such as herbs and citrus notes, and little attachment to base notes. Also, these types of perfumes are often reused throughout the day. Common perfumes used today include citrus, sea, wood, and leather. In most cases, colognes are marketed to men. difference between perfume and cologne Perfumes have a stronger scent than cologne, due to their higher concentration of essential oils and are generally less expensive. Cologne on the other hand is mostly marketed towards men, however they are unisex, and a lot of women enjoy using cologne rather than perfume. What are the pros and cons of perfumes and colognes? Each type of smell has its pros and cons. Here are the pros and cons of perfumes and colognes. Perfume Benefits - Perfumes have a stronger smell than colognes because of the high concentration of essential oils.- It doesn't take a lot of nostalgia to make a big statement.- The fragrance is versatile and can be added to the bath, hair or skin depending on your intentions.- Some perfume bottles are very portable.- For users with sensitive skin, the lower the alcohol content, the better.Conss of Perfume- Perfume can be quite expensive, which sometimes puts the average user off.- Those with a sensitive nose can feel the overwhelming scent with an extremely pungent scent.Cologne Benefits. Cologne is for men but unisex and many women prefer cologne instead of perfume.- Premium colognes use premium ingredients that provide a much longer-lasting fragrance.- For convenience, the fragrance is available in spray or spray form.- Cologne is often more reasonably priced than perfumes with high concentrations of essential oils.- Colognes has a subtle scent that won't overwhelm or attract unwanted attention.Cons ofCologne- Cologne bottles often have odd or bulky designs, making them less suitable for travel. if you know More information click the link ::[LINKED_TEXT: Operfu] [URL: https://operfu.com/difference-between-perfume-and-toilette/]"},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"My understanding of “bulking up” is that it is a process of adding fat as well as muscle."},{"instruction":"What numbers of replications of an experiment would make the results most conclusive?","output":"What numbers of replications of an experiment would make the results most conclusive? This isn’t really the right question. Yes, experiments must be replicated in order to be considered valid. That is absolutely correct. But, the strength of a scientific understanding comes from scrutiny, and consensus - versus a formulaic number of repetitions. This scrutiny includes… Can it be replicated (as you’ve asked about?)This usually implies, replicated by someone else. This is needed not just to avoid outright fraud by unscrupulous scientists, but to ensure quality in the performance of the experiment (see number 2.)Is the experiment well designed and performed? Simply repeating a badly designed, or badly performed experiment will confirm the same bad results. Part of what peer review is supposed to do, is flesh out experiments that are inherently flawed in their design (so they give skewed or meaningless data) and experiments that are well designed, but badly executed (I.e. your process inadvertently introduced or destroyed protein products that would significantly alter the results, etc.)Do the data warrant the conclusions made? One must remember, experiments only generate data. Then the significance of the data, and the conclusions from the data must be deduced. Significance of the data takes two forms: Statistical significance, and (for lack of a better word) meaningfulness. Statistical significance is usually annotated by a [LINKED_TEXT: p-value] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value] which (simplified) means “We see a difference between the [LINKED_TEXT: Hypothesis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis] and the [LINKED_TEXT: Null Hypothesis] [URL: https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/]. But what is the statistical probability that (in this one experiment) this difference may have occurred just by random chance, even if there’s really no difference?” Normally a p-value of 0.05 or less is considered “statistically significant.”The “meaningfulness” is more subjective. As an example, you do an experiment to see if drug A is different (better?) than drug B. You do the experiment, and you see a statistically significant difference in “factor X” between the two drug’s. But so what? While the statistical significance of “factor X” is certain, does this difference actually change how the drug works? Is it scientifically significant? As for “how many (validations)” … this also is not really the best way to look at scientific validation. In addition to all the above formal ways, science is validated by the practical use of it. When a paper describes a new scientific conclusion, other scientists will build on that conclusion. They will recreate the experiment exactly as a form of validation, but they will also perform new research that builds on the previous discovery (which, defacto, determines if the previous discovery is “correct.”) For example, a scientist may conclude that inflammation is associated with chemical “Factor Y”. So others look at her/his paper, and agree that the experiment was well performed, and the conclusions seemed reasonable to the data. So, they start working on a drug to interfere with “factor Y” - with the assumption that removing factor Y should reduce inflammation. But, while they successfully removed factor Y with the drug, the inflammation does not decrease. So…Even though the experiment (at the time) was reproducible, and the design, execution, and conclusions were all well done … it turns out they were wrong. Maybe because of something they didn’t know yet. Maybe there is a “co-factor Z” that has to be involved too. Maybe for some other reasons. Maybe because the experiment was just wrong. But, the nice thing about science - is these things get teased out eventually. A lot of people (mistakenly) think that, “If it’s published - it’s just a scientific FACT!” But this is an oversimplification. Even if the experiment is reproducible, and the paper is well scrutinized - if enough people find the conclusions simply to not work in the real world, the “conclusion will be scrapped or otherwise altered to match what’s actually happening in the lab.” And this is wonderful because figuring out the details of why something does, or does not, work - simply leads to a better understanding of the something. There are no “failed experiments” because you always learn something from them…even if it’s that, “This means nothing. Move on. ”"},{"instruction":"What is your opinion on Facebook trying to buy major shares of Reliance Jio?","output":"A lot of experts have analysed this deal and a lot of them have got it wrong.

A REAL CASE OF REINCARNATION OF A MUSLIM MAN INTO A HINDU FAMILY - Year: 1980 Place: Kakori, a village near Lucknow, UP The story in brief: Mushir Ali, son of Haidar Ali, was born in strict Muslim family. Mushir was the sole bread winner of the family - selling fruits on cart. When he was 25, he met with an accident - his cart collided with a tractor and he died to severe rib injuries. Less than a year later, he, now named Naresh, was born in Bazbazar in Lucknow district. When he was two years old he started praying like Muslims do during Namaz. He would also speaking in Urdu, a language his current parents or family members did not speak. When he was around four, he narrated his story of previous life to his father, Guruprasad, and mother, Bishwana. Naresh remembered his father visiting Bazbazar every Thursday to pray for other Muslims and earn his living through it. Naresh would follow Haidar and call him ‘Abba’ (Dad). But Haidar Ali refused to talk about Naresh because his religion prohibited him from acknowledge reincarnation. But Guruprasad was convinced that Naresh was Mushir Ali in his previous life. Naresh finds his Past Life Home and Identifies Past Life Relatives & Friends Guruprasad, Naresh’s father, finally decided to take him to Kakori. They were accompanied by some friends. Once in Kakori, Naresh led the group to the house where Mushir Ali lived. Inside the house, he identified several objects that belonged to Mushir, including Mushir’s cap and contents of Mushir’s suitcase. Naresh also recognized and named members of Mushir’s immediate family, relatives and friends. He also accurately told the Ali family about a bank account that the family had at the time that Mushir died. Further, Naresh mentioned the name of a person who owed money to Mushir, which the family verified. The Ali family added that this individual who owed money paid it back after Mushir’s death. And, Naresh was born with a birth mark on his chest - the spot where he was hit during his accident in his previous life. Haidar Ali accepted Naresh as his dead son Mushir’s reincarnation.

Would you mind terribly if I told more than one? OMG, what a question. My time in the IDF mirrored nothing less than the movie, “Forrest Gump”. I had some amazing experiences and very close calls, too. Looking back, I know now that G-d was definitely watching over me. Paratroopers in my time did X months of basic, (ours was shortened because of the war), including ‘sadeh’—in-the-field at the infamous, treacherous Hamam el Maliach in the summer, X months front line, X months winter training, X months front line again, X months Sergeant’s Course, then off to other places such as Rabatim, G’dud, and ‘parts unknown’. The longer you go back in time in the history of the IDF, the more you’ll see how austere and utterly harsh the conditions were for combat soldiers. During basic, in Sanur, or while in-the-field ‘somewhere in the Biq’a’, many guys could not cope any longer. I remember thinking to myself, “Wow….look at this guy. He’s a gorilla, 10x stronger than me….” But physical strength is not mental strength. So lots of those guys asked to leave, or simply disappeared ‘nifkad’. You had to be able to suffer mentally or you weren’t going to make it. You had to learn to cope with always being hungry, filthy, exhausted. Sleep deprivation is a form or torture, for sure. Sometime towards the beginning of October, after 5 grueling months of basic, our platoon filled a bus and traveled to the northwestern-most corner of Israel and crossed into Lebanon. This was our first ‘front-line’ duty. We traveled north and hooked a right at _____, then we were in the mountains. Everybody was trying to kill their neighbor. What stuck out for me was the enmity between the Christians (Israel supported) and the Druze (they serve in the IDF with honor). They were constantly ambushing each other with terrible consequences. Until you see this with the eyes in your head, you cannot comprehend it. Your mind has certain defenses so you won’t be affected by people butchering one another. All this goes out the window in Lebanon. During that time, one weekend after a Shabbat rest in Israel, I missed our bus in Tel Aviv that was going to take us back to ____ in the mountains. I got there a little late and my platoon left without me and the other stragglers, still unknown to me. So I had to hitchhike all the way to Rosh HaNikra, cross to Naqura, then somehow get to ______. I caught a tremp with some reserve-niks in a jeep. “How far are you guys going?” I asked. “Beirut”, they said. “Can you give me a ride to Sidon?” “Yallah, hop in.” When we arrived in Sidon, I got out with my Galil (my bestie at the time) and my chimidan. The jeep left. I didn’t see an IDF checkpoint. Nothing in sight. I was at the place I last remembered turning towards the mountains, but I was utterly alone. Just me and the bad guys. I already had a bullet in my chamber, but I ‘chambered’ once more, just so anybody that was watching (everybody) saw that there was a bullet ready to fire in my magazine and that I was not fucking around. I walked to the side of the road where an Arab was selling cans of pineapple juice. Then I waited eagerly on the coastal road. About 10–15 minutes later an IDF jeep pulled up. When they saw me, they asked, “WTF are you doing here alone???!” I told them what happened. Thanks be to Allah, they were continuing in my direction, east and up to the _____ . I jumped in and thanked G-d many times for saving me from what could have been a very nasty kidnapping. Although there was no Hezbollah officially at the time, I always thought that maybe the bad guys just didn’t have enough time to contact their superiors and tell them that there was an Israeli soldier alone in their village. I have other crazy experiences, we all do…..saved for another time. Unfortunately, all of these ‘happenings’ are imprinted in our memories forever. Mine were light compared to others before me. *** I have almost 200 answers on the subject of Israel.

The reason I say tobirama is 2 reasons: flying raijin and his knowledge. Let’s start with knowledge. Tobirama has more knowledge about uchiha than any other uchiha that has lived after the uchiha and senju arc. He studied the uchiha to understand what exactly makes them unique and where their power comes from. He had done many things that perfectly prove my statement like how the police precinct was so far from midtown of Konoha, how Hashirama would constantly tell him to stop hating on Uchiha, how he almost killed sasuke (yes he would have killed sasuke easily if hashirama wasn’t there but of course he can’t do that anymore). He completely understands extensively how exactly the mangekyou and normal sharingan works and how to counter it. itachi’s tsukyomi wouldn’t work first of all because he would never look in his eyes, nor any other move with eye contact. He also understand that people with mangekyou have specific powers including the susanoo so he would keep his guard and distance from him imuntil the perfect time in case of anything (like Amaterasu). Next, because of flying raijin. If you don’t know how it works basically he puts a mark on anything of matter like a shuriken or a tree and he can summon himself to where the mark has been put. Of course itachi never let anybody come in actual contact with him like taijutsu unless he is going easy (like sasuke), so tobirama couldn’t be able to put it on him, but itachi also has no knowledge of flying raijin so tobirama could then again just throw one at him and kill him. Yea funny. I know itachi would probably use genjutsu on him and once he sees his move he would completely understand it, but that doesn’t stop him. Tobirama firstly probably has very good counters for genjutsu from his knowledge plus anywhere tobirama travels he could put markers and he could put infinite and itachi just couldn’t keep up. So all his moves could not work, except maybe susanoo, but then again he can’t keep it for long. Let’s say he could keep it for 5 whole minutes. Tobirama would just keep using flying raijin to escape until his susanoo runs out. Anything itachi does is useless, plus tobirama’s huge arsenal of water type moves to counter his fire balls, and use the mist just like he did with madara’s brother. So itachi’s fire style is out, is sharingan is out, what else could he do? Not much. Don’t get me wrong itachi is very very VERY smart and strong but his arsenal is too small, he has low chakra, and he’s up against a hokage that has studied his whole life on how to stop him.

In small print, I wrote in the binding those formulas too long to easily memorize. Almost everyone in my dorm did this. NONE OF THE FORMULAS WERE OF USE ON THE EXAMS. I think all this was done on purpose. Almost all of us threw out the written-in math table books, bought replacements, and gave up on cheating. Late Junior Year we had an exam from a prof everyone feared and who changed rules frequently. The subject had a reputation of having a very tough Final. At the last class before Final, someone asked, “Professor, will this be Open Book?” “You can bring along a Visiting Professor for all the good that will do you.” That reply became famous and was repeated for years. When you had profs like that, you did not cheat, you STUDIED. And yes, I passed his Subject, but barely. Is there cheating at MIT?

In fact, some studies have shown that microwave cooking can actually preserve nutrients better than other cooking methods. For example, one study found that microwaving broccoli preserved more vitamin C than boiling or steaming. Microwaves work by emitting electromagnetic radiation that causes water molecules in food to vibrate, which produces heat. This type of radiation is non-ionizing, which means it does not have enough energy to break chemical bonds in DNA. This is in contrast to ionizing radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, which can damage DNA and lead to cancer. There have been some concerns that microwaves may cause cancer, but these concerns have been based on animal studies and have not been shown to be true in humans. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that there is no evidence that microwaves cause cancer in humans. Of course, as with any cooking method, there are some potential risks associated with microwaving food. For example, some plastics can leach chemicals into food when heated, so it is important to use only microwave-safe plastics. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. In fact, microwaving can be a convenient and healthy way to cook food. Just be sure to follow safe cooking practices and use only microwave-safe materials. Here are some tips for safe microwave cooking: Always use microwave-safe dishes and containers.Stir food halfway through cooking.Do not use metal or foil in the microwave.Avoid microwaving plastic containers that are not labeled as microwave-safe.

I love reading good questions about economics, and writing about economics when I can. I’m a numbers guy and I’m fascinated by the flows of currency and how it drives our economy. But I’m disheartened by the partisan nature of much of the discussion. (Can we separate economics from politics? It’s hard.) I could probably show that you are incorrect in your assertion, but that’s not what I intend to answer. For one thing, fiscal policy is managed by Congress, and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The President has only indirect influence over both. For another thing, fiscal and monetary policies can influence the deficit but the deficit is really not directly attributable to Congress. There are other factors including trade and economic performance. We know that federal income taxes make up a large portion of government revenue, and taxes are reduced whenever unemployment is high. And when we have a trade deficit, more dollars are flowing out of our country than back in. As a matter of accounting, they have to be replaced somehow. (Typically, as with China, they “lend” us those dollars back by purchasing securities.) And finally we have ask ourselves whether a deficit is a bad thing. Many pundits assume it is without questioning why. Much of the public believes it will result in higher taxes, but there’s little historical precedent for that. To get to the question, let’s take a glance at the history of US sectoral balances [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #OdzfI]:The red line ([T]axes - [G]overnment spending) is the topic of this question, positive when in surplus, negative in deficit. The last surplus was year 2000. The green line represents net private savings. Blue is the foreign sector, basically trade (i[M]ports - e[X]ports). All three sum to zero, as a matter of accounting. So if Congress has their finger on the red line, and is able to move it to zero through policy, what happens to private savings and trade? How are they impacted? This is an interesting thought experiment, but cannot quite play out in reality. When discussing macroeconomics, I’m often reminded of Newton’s third law from classical physics: “Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” Similarly here, we can’t move one sector without affecting others. Reducing spending would immediately shrink the economy and raise unemployment, reducing taxation, pushing the deficit upwards. The one constant in the chart above is trade, which has been in deficit since the early 1990’s. There are some shenanigans here, and it involves the Asian economy. The US likes cheap labor, and China has their currency pegged to ours (they buy US debt to maintain the exchange rate). This trade policy isn’t partisan though, it’s how US business operates. No matter whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. It’s also due to consumer preference. US consumers like cheap goods. They flock to stores like Walmart and buy cheap LED television displays for under 200. We are also a smartphone culture now, with one Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy or similar for almost every American, and we are accustomed to replacing them every couple years. Could we bring back the manufacturing of these goods to the US? Yes, we could. Would we pay double the price? In short, as long as we want cheap goods from Asia, we’ll probably always have a deficit. No matter who is elected to office. (Tariffs might have an influence on this but it’s too early to tell.) Stop importing goods, boost domestic manufacturing, increase our tax base, shrink unemployment to zero (and boost immigration so we’ll have the labor we need). Boom, deficit goes away (or shrinks to match private savings, but the private sector is cyclical). But is that what we really want? For a majority of Americans, I’m guessing the answer is “no”. The US is a service and consumer economy. China has a manufacturing economy. Americans enjoy a high standard of living. (We see similar divisions in Europe, where Germany for example is a strong manufacturing economy, while other EU states run a deficit.) So let’s stop pretending this is a partisan issue, please. Until and unless there is a major trade war and/or collapse of our currency, the current status quo is unlikely to change.

Let me put it this way you want to be that star surgeon who does many surgeries day to earn about 2 to 4 lakhs a month or run a star facility without fretting so much and earn 30 lakhs per month? Welcome to skills seller rather than skill seller Dont focus on learning a skill , rather learn a skill of catching such skilled people, motivating them, branding them, praising their success and sell that success at premium. You don't need to be a salesman, that's what leadership is , that's where true wealth is. Just think if bill gates had been debugging and fixing windows 3.1 himself, would Microsoft empire been formed???

Muhammad ibn Sa'd ibn Mani' al-Baghdadi or Ibn Sa'd (Arabic: ابن سعد‎), born in the year 168AH/784CE) and died in 230AH/845CE wrote Kitab Tabaqat Al-Kubra which was a compendium of biographical information about famous Islamic personalities in 8 volumes. He (lbn Sa\`d) said: Hishám Ibn Muhammad Ibn al-Sa'ib al-Kalbi informed us on the authority of his father, he on the authority of Abu Salih, he on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas; he said: Adam was cast down in India and Eve at Juddah. Then he came in her search and reached Jam'a; then Eve joined him, and so the place was known as al-Muzdalifah, and they had come together at Jam'a so it was known as Jam'a.

At-Tabarani, Abu Nu'aim and Ibn Asakir all related from Abu Hurairah (ra) that the Messenger of Allah (saws) said \\"Adam (as) descended in India.\\" And At-Tabarani related the following narration from Abdullah ibn Umar (ra): When Allah made Adam (as) descend, He made him descend in the land of India. He then went to Makkah and afterwards went to Ash-Shams, which is where he died. 5. कुरआन के प्रसिद्ध भाष्यकार इब्ने कसीर ने मुस्नद ए अब्दुर्रज़्ज़ाक़ को उद्धृत करते हुए अपने भाष्य में लिखा है कि ‘‘ह. आदम अ. भारत की भूमि पर उतरे थे। उनका क़द बहुत लम्बा था।‘‘ ईशदूत ह. मुहम्मद स. के सत्संगिंयों तथा अन्य मुस्लिम संतों और इतिहासकारों की एक बड़ी संख्या से यहीउल्लिखित है कि पृथ्वी के पहले मानव ने, जो ईश्वर के पहले दूत भी थे, अपना पहला क़दम भारत में रखा। उन्होंने अपनी संतान में ईश-प्रदत्त सनातन धर्म (अरबी भाषा में दीन-ए क़य्यिम) का प्रचार प्रसार किया और बाद में समय समय पर संसार के विभिन्न भागों में ईशदूतों ने उसी एकईश्वरीय धर्म को पुनर्जीवित किया। आदम या आदिम शब्द, जिसका अर्थ है ‘‘सबसे पहला‘‘, भारतीय मूल का होना भी यही सिद्ध करता है कि आदि मानव भारत में उतरा। उसी को बाद में भारतीय साहित्य में आदि मनु या स्वयंभू मनु कहा गया। स्वायंभू मनु अरू सतरूपा।जिन्ह तें भै नरसृष्टि अनूपा।। दंपत्ति धरम आचरण नीका। अजहुँ गाव श्रुति जिन्ह कै लीका।। (रामचरित मानस, दो. 141, चौ. 1) अर्थात स्वायम्भूव मनु और उसकी पत्नी शत्रूपा जिन से मनुष्यों की यह अनुपम सृष्टि हुई, इन दोनों पति पत्नी के धर्म और आचरण बहुत अच्छे थे आज भी वेद जिनकी मर्यादा का गान करते हैं। In the above Hindi Quotation – Ramcharitmanas – revered book of Hinduism speaks about Adam, and his wife Hawwa. It is important to mention that hadees speaking about Prophet Adam’s descent in India has been declared weak by Muhaddesseen (those who collect Hadees); but few points that are important are: a) We don’t find any Sahi Hadees contradicting this. b) Weak / dhayeef Hadees does not mean unauthentic but absence of a few chain of narrations; lesser number of people narrating Hadees etc. c) Moreover we have seen lot of other proofs and will see further that gives strong indication towards Prophet Adam being in India.

However in the war, 200b will not last long. The Russian economy is being hit by inflation and production shortages. There is high unemployment.

There are a variety of methods one can use to reduce face fat, including diet and exercise, facial exercises, and even some lifestyle changes. 1. Diet and Exercise: Eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise are essential components of reducing face fat. Eating a diet that is high in complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats will help to reduce overall body fat, including facial fat. Additionally, engaging in at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise five times per week will help to burn calories and melt away fat. 2. Facial Exercises: There are a variety of facial exercises that can be used to help reduce face fat. These exercises include things like puckering your lips and making exaggerated facial expressions, or simply massaging the facial muscles in a circular motion. Doing these facial exercises for five to ten minutes each day will help to tone and tighten the facial muscles, which can reduce the appearance of fat in the face. 3. Lifestyle Changes: Making a few small lifestyle changes can also help to reduce face fat. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary beverages and processed foods will help to reduce overall body fat, including fat in the face. Additionally, reducing stress and getting adequate rest will also help to reduce facial fat. 4. Skin Care: Taking care of your skin is also important when it comes to reducing face fat. Using a good facial cleanser and moisturizer will help to keep the skin healthy and hydrated, which can help to reduce the appearance of facial fat. Additionally, using a good sunscreen can help to protect the skin from sun damage, which can also help to reduce facial fat. By making a few changes to your diet and lifestyle, and incorporating some facial exercises and skin care, you can reduce face fat and achieve a more sculpted and toned facial appearance. With a little bit of dedication and effort, you can reduce face fat and be proud of the results. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

I haven’t even heard of one project she’s been in since the end of GoT. No disrespect to her though, as she was great in GoT. Richard Madden, however, who plays Robb Stark, has been more successful, I’d say. There’s a picture for the girls and gays to enjoy. Even as a straight man, I can see the appeal. Richard Madden seems to be popping up in all manner of places from films such as Eternals to TV shows like Bodyguard and Medici (outstanding in Medici and very good in what I’ve seen of Bodyguard). A very prolofic actor starring in some big-name films. But I think we all know there’s only one winner of this matchup (as much as I like Richard Madden). Pedro Pascal. He’s the star of the Mandoverse, star of the new Last of Us show, star of Narcos.

Generally, the roads may get blocked due to heavy rains and landslides. Moreover, you may not be able to trek anywhere. So, the best duration to visit the beautiful kingdom is between October and February. Arrangements to be done beforehand while travelling to Bhutan: Booking a Hotel & Vehicle through Agency.During peak season, it’s very difficult to get hotels and vehicles on arrival. So, it’s better to book in advance at a nominal price; to be precise, decent budget hotels will charge around Rs 1,500 to 3,000 and for vehicles, it’s Rs 3,000 per day.

I knew that the society's advice: \\"go to school, get a job, work hard, get out of debt and save money\\" is BS and no one ever got rich by following this advice. AND I didn't want to work a job for 40 years to stay just above broke and settle for mediocrity, just because everyone else does. I wanted to escape the rat race and be financially free! So, One Day I woke up and promised myself that in few years I will become so filthy rich that whenever I go out whether with my friends or to buy something I do not have to look at my bank balance before swiping my credit card . I still remember that day, 26 May 2015 when I made this promise.

Since the point is to face a no-win scenario, it’s very hard to fail. In the scenario, the prospective captain is in a situation where there appears to be a Federation civilian ship in the Neutral Zone, and it is asking for help. You need to determine whether or not to rescue the people, and how. So what happens if you turn and run? That’s actually the logical thing to do; the ship is within the Neutral Zone, you can’t find it on your sensors, and the opposing power has cloaked ships. But it is likely that doing so is the only way to “lose.” If you go after the ship, you will end up outnumbered and outgunned, by a significant margin. Your choices are to surrender, abandon ship, or fight to the death. (I think fighting to the death is probably another way to lose.) Data, when we first meet him at the start of TNG, is somewhat naive but looks mostly to logic. Most likely, he would follow the same path as Saavik in The Wrath of Khan, and end up abandoning ship. He would know the capabilities of his ship and the opposing ships, and would conclude that fighting is not going to work. He might keep the shields up inside the Neutral Zone, though, which might increase the survival time. But, yes, I assume Data could pass the Kobayashi Maru, by facing a no-win scenario."},{"instruction":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","output":"Fear, the morons who run everything, lack of funding for R&D on cool inventions, laws of physics (these are movies after all)."},{"instruction":"Why am I not making any money on my affiliate marketing?","output":"Its probably your traffic its not targeted enough.."},{"instruction":"What puzzles you most about humans?","output":"They fight over which religion is the right one"},{"instruction":"have OpenSUSE 11.3 and Linux Mint installed on my computer, but openSUSE won't boot from the GRUB menu and just shows a black screen.

I guess that you installed OpenSuSE first and then Linux Mint, and something in the install process of the latter overwrote the part that booted OpenSuSE. I’m not suggesting that you necessarily did something wrong, but rather that the installation of Linux Mint was slightly too easy. It should have dealt with this setup more properly, stopped and waited for your input. But I suppose Linux Mint gives you advanced tools for managing GRUB, and you have to use those and hopefully you remember at least something about where you installed OpenSuSE, so that you can point GRUB to its root partition!."},{"instruction":"have scoliosis, how do I ensure that both sides of my lower back will be engaged equally during a back squat?","output":"I wouldn't advise doing a squat bilaterally because of the uneven curvature causing elongation and shortening of the muscles. Therefore, one's going to be more activated than the other, and one will more likely develop spasms. I would recommend that you start strengthening the concave side of the scoliosis and stretch out the convex side to reduce the curve of the vertebral column. Additionally, depending on the severity and condition (heredity vs. imbalance), you'll need a brace or surgery to fix it.

Dennis's history document which others point, describes the sequence in detail. The summary is this: C itself is a descendant of the language B, originally created (as others have suggested) for the PDP-7. The first C compiler was written in something (short lived) that Dennis called NB or NewB. NB was written on and targeted to the PDP-11 not the PDP-7. NB was created because of deficiencies the team had run into when they moved their B code to the PDP-11. NewB was written in B, because by that time B had been written in itself. That said, Thompson original B compiler was written in PDP-7 assembler. NB was refined and gave birth to C. C itself was refined by Dennis multiple times (again described in his document). If you want an interesting project, look at the wonderful work Warren Toomey and team did with its restoration of 1st Edition UNIX can be found at [LINKED_TEXT: unix-jun72 - Restoration of 1st Edition UNIX kernel sources from pdf document. - Google Project Hosting] [URL: https://code.google.com/p/unix-jun72/] There is an early C compiler and a good deal of B and assembler code there. BTW: The Portable C Compiler (aka the Johnson Compiler) referred to by others, was not the first C compiler to be retargeted. Dennis's compiler and (what was called \\"typesetter C\\" when it was released independently from UNIX itself) was the first to be retargeted. That compiler, which was approximately the version of the Ritchie Compiler that was used in UNIX/TS (aka 7th edition) was retargeted to a Honeywell machine and the IBM 360 before PCC. I believe it was also retargeted to Interdata system when the first UNIX \\"port\\" was done. Plus many people outside of the Murray Hill, such as myself, retargeted it to the then newly emerging microprocessors to support projects we had. The first one of these I saw was a Z80 compiler from the Teletype folks circa 1977/78. I did one for an experimental chip what would become the M68000 (it was not yet named when we started the profile), although my compiler sucked at code generation (it worked good enough however). I quickly switched to a more complete implementation of the V7 C compiler that the MIT RTS guys created a year or so later. About 10-24 months after that, was when the first version of the Johnson compiler began to appear outside of the labs."},{"instruction":"What is a candid picture?","output":"the best pose you can give for a photo is not to give a pose. that is exactly what a candid is. when you frame the subject in this case a person without his or her knowledge. but its not necessary that a candid is always a person’s photo. sometimes you are just checking your camera with some random shots and you get a picture which you never expect. i like to call that a candid too. like this"},{"instruction":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","output":"“oh, i see you gave it a crew cut”"},{"instruction":"As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.

I had been living in my apartment for 9 years and was really struggling financially. I had found a place much farther from my job that was going to charge me 50 less. I was in a pretty dire situation and 50 was literally a “make it or break it” amount. I asked my landlord to come over and we sat down and I was able to negotiate with him to take 50 off my rent so that I would not have to move. He could very well have made more money if I had left, but I had been one of those good tenants that never caused trouble. Since I had rental assistance his check was on time every month, and I did many of the minor repairs in the place without him having to deal with it. A few years later he hired a property management company to take over all of his rental units and they bumped my rent up by 350. I wasn't in quite the same financial distress as I had been previously, but it was still enough that I had to eventually move. I was there 17 years in total. I had begged him to not put my unit on that contract because there was no management required, but he did it anyway and he lost a good tenant over it."},{"instruction":"Why is there so little trash on the streets of Vancouver, British Columbia, relative to any other city, such as San Francisco?","output":"Pride"},{"instruction":"Are atoms observable? If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","output":"I am shocked that a thread like this does not mention Earnest Rutherford. So, at the risk of coming (very) late to the party and being completely ignored, let me comment on what “observable” means and why the neat images we can make today are redundant to Rutherford’s 1909 experiment. If your definition of “observable” is narrowly defined as “human observable,” then the answer to your question is “no,” and always will be, regardless of technological advancement. Atoms cannot be resolved by human eyes. You would also be classifying most modern discoveries as technically unobservable. If you have a more reasonable definition, and accept “images” like those produced by an AFM, STM, or similar, as an observation, then the answer is “yes.” But these advanced imaging techniques “observe” the surface of a material in the same way that all experiments work - they exploit a naturally occurring phenomenon to measure something useful. They don’t fundamentally add anything that Rutherford’s gold foil experiment didn’t already, as it pertains to your question. In fact, Rutherford’s experiment is somewhat more direct because he observed the nucleus, whereas modern scanners only interact with the electron cloud of the sample. What scanner do add is spatial resolution and sensitivity that Rutherford could only dream of during his time."},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"My family has always had cats — sometimes dogs, too.

But, this time, I was the President of the fraternity, and when there’s a bunch of college-aged guys in a public park at night, well, some people will think the worst. I saw these two women across the street, peering towards us in the darkness. I thought, “I should go reassure them that we’re not doing anything illegal, immoral, dangerous, etc. because I don’t want them to call the cops and ruin the ceremony.” So, I walked towards them. They saw me coming a long way away. But when I got within maybe 50 feet, one of them yelled, “Run!” in fear and they took off and ran into a nearby house.

I am writing this answer considering you have one year of time for next NEET exam. Your strategy should be very clear. Devise a weekly study plan and then divide it to make a daily schedule.First make a reading from your NCERT BOOK to develop basic understanding of this book.(skimming is needed at this stage, understanding the headings).By the end you should know about the topics you have to read.Now go through your allen or aakash study material (whichever u like more do it first ). By now you should have understood your theory part.Now you solve all the numericals from the study material.(This is very important to clear your concepts). If there is any problem then refee to Ncert or your study material from allen or aakash.Now solve the numericals and examples fron the NCERT book.This should be sufficient to develop your basic understanding of your topic. Now you should be able to apply your knowledge of theory to solve numericals. For biology, you need to focus specially on NCERT.(Read it again and again) Now comes the hardest part where you need to retain the huge volume of information. You will need to revise the topics again and again. Try to complete your syllabus atleast 2 times. By now you should be able to answer majority of questions asked in exams. But this is not enough. You should enroll in test series of allen/ aakash. This will give you a study schedule to prepare accordingly. At the same time you will be able to solve new pattern questions which will keep you updated and give you much needed confidence.(After all the battle is not won in battlefield, but in the mind) If you have some time i would like to recommed you some books to boost your preparation during your final stage(few months before exam) For biology- Solve Ncert at your fingertips(This will help you retain huge amount of information from your NCERT book) But use this book only in final stages. For Physics and Chemistry, solve Universal self scorer from the beginning(only if you can manage that time). This will give you an extra edge over others.(i guess it is all about that extra edge in this cut throat competition) In last months you should give major test series of Allen and Aakash also.(many of questions are repeated from these) Remember as soom as u give a test, come home and solve the paper again. Then go to the theory part when you face difficulty in solving a question.

Not unless you are both very diligent and lucky, and you have to remain just as diligent for the long-haul. Research indicates that people who lose weight at a rate greater than 1 or 2 pounds per week are likely to re-gain much of, if not all, of that weight in the following year or two. Let me add one clarification: If you are severely obese, as I was, then it is both possible and fairly common to lose weight faster than 1 or 2 pounds per week at first. There is no downside to that, apart from the hard work that you have to do in order to achieve it. The work becomes harder and harder, however, the closer you get to your target weight. It can still be done, but that is where the likelihood of rebounding back in the other direction as soon as you become less diligent about your diet and exercise regimens kicks in. If you want to know the story about how I did that work and took off weight quickly, read on. I lost 100 pounds in 12 months. I didn't set out trying to lose weight that fast, but I was pleased that it happened. I can tell you how I did it, but you should take it only as general advice, not a specific plan, because we are all different. You (the OP of the question that I originally answered, before merge-mania took hold) asked about losing weight twice that fast, and I cannot recommend that you try that unless you are able to (a) dedicate yourself nearly full-time to the task, and (b) have medical supervision at every step along the way, along with a significant amount of help from a nutritionist and personal trainer. I started by seeing a nutritionist. She helped me by giving me three dietary guidelines, a goal for working out, and two pieces of valuable advice. The three guidelines were: cut my grain intake by 50%, double my fruit and vegetable intake, and stick to a daily calorie count of 1800-2000 per day. (The calorie goal was personalized for me, based on what my BMR would be as I approached my target weight.) The workout goal was 3 times per week, for a minimum of 30 minutes of cardio. The valuable advice was to use a program on my phone to track my calories and workouts, and to use sugarless gum as a diversion from my \\"nervous eating\\" habit. What I actually did was to cut my grain intake by more than 50%, and more than double my fruit and vegetable intake. I probably cut my grain intake to somewhere between 10 and 20% of what it was. Rice several times per week went to a small serving once a month. The same was true for pasta. Bread went down to one sandwich per week. I probably quadrupled my fruit and vegetable intake. Raw snap peas and carrots became my go-to snacks. Apples, citrus and melons became my regular desserts, apart from a once or twice per month small serving of ice cream. (Ben & Jerry's makes single-serving containers!) I used MyFitnessPal as my tracking program, and I chewed a lot of sugarless gum. The idea behind the nutritional guidelines was that they were loose enough to allow me to find what would work for me. My nutritionist's philosophy was that as long as I stuck to the calorie target, cut my grains and increased fruits and vegetables, everything else would work out. I would quickly learn how to manage my portions at meals, and what I could get away with (e.g., in terms of snacks, carbs and fatty foods) without either blowing through my target of 2000 calories or being hungry all the time. And the idea of staying above the minimum of 1800 calories per day was that I would be getting what my body needed in order to keep my metabolism from slowing down drastically. As for working out, I also went beyond the target. Instead of just 3 times per week for 30 minutes, I ended up working out five times per week for 45 to 60 minutes. It was actually easier that way, because in order to do that I had to make working out part of my routine, and if I missed a day I had to make it up right away instead of just shrugging it off. I initially intended to swim at the YMCA for my cardio, because I was afraid that my feet and knees wouldn't hold up to other types of exercise. It's very important to take any physical limitations you may already have due to your weight into account! I found, however, that I had no endurance in the pool. I could barely swim one length of the pool and back. My next choice was to try an elliptical machine, which is also relatively easy on the knees and feet, and I found I had much better endurance at that right from the start. That's not to say that I could immediately do 30 minutes at an intense pace, though. I got to 15 minutes on an easy setting the first day, and I worked up from there, getting quickly to 30 minutes, then worked my way up to 45, and eventually got to 60 - and occasionally beyond that (when I had the time). While increasing my endurance, I was slowly increasing the difficulty settings until I could do 60 minutes on a program called \\"Fat Burner\\" (on Precor elliptical machines) at a very intense rate. My knees and feet didn't give me problems, and what surprised me the most was that my asthma didn't either. My point is not, though, that you should go jump on an elliptical machine. It's that you should assess your condition, and try different workouts until you find something that you can do, and which you can push yourself to get better at. And my larger point is that you need to learn what works best for you. We are all different. Asking for advice is great, but don't seek out a step-by-step prescription that tells you exactly what to do. Learning from the advice you get, and from listening to your own body is the real key. It's doubly important because learning becomes part of your motivation. Each day is an experiment, and you are both the subject and the scientist! It's a continuous process. Things will change along the way. For example, after I got to the point where I could do an hour of intense working out on the elliptical, I tried swimming again. I found that I was able to do about 10 minutes without stopping, and I was able to build that up over a couple of months to being able to swim for an hour. It’s now more than two years later. I did a good job of keeping the weight off for a year, but it has started creeping back on. I’m still more than 80 pounds lighter than at my worst point, but I’d like to be doing better. Bicycling is now my main source of exercise. In fact, I’ve become somewhat of a fanatic about it, having ridden more than 10,000 miles in the past two years, including a seven-day / 550-mile charity ride this past summer, and I’m signed up to do it again next year! But my diet habits have not been as diligent. My late-night munching problem is my major problem in that respect. I know I have to take it on, and I know I have the wherewithal to do it, but it’s been a struggle lately. And again, I have to say that I would not try to do this in six months. That's too fast. You can't (or shouldn't) cut your calorie intake drastically below what I did, so you would have to be working out at least three times as much as I did, and that will be very hard to do. It will almost certainly be impossible, and quite dangerous, to do it on your own."},{"instruction":"w do I train a migraine alert dog?","output":"Most of those dogs respond to issues genetically.

At that point in time, Jane Austen went ahead and boldly wrote about the way the institution of marriage worked in the 18th century.

Either way, the bloke proceeded to speak with great wisdom: “Nah mate. I know with you folks, you’ll grant me a wish alright, but sooner or later it’ll come back to bite me in the rear.” “I give you my word that shall not happen.” The genie rumbled solemnly. “If it does, I shall compensate you with another hundred wishes.” The bloke thought this over carefully. “Alright then,” he said finally. “I wish for a boomerang with teeth.” Silence ensued.

Why do folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand think that they are entitled to free healthcare?","output":"Let’s get the easy part of this answer out of the way first then address the your blind commitment to a stone-age principle. Universal healthcare in NOT free, it is paid for through taxes. In the case of Canada, those taxes, the overall tax burden of Canadians, is lower than that of the U.S. That being said, the per capita cost of healthcare in Canada is half that of the U.S. which is the highest in the world with the poorest outcomes. With that point out of the way, let’s get into your comments. First, the United States does not have a healthcare system. It does have an insurance risk management system that provides healthcare. Huge difference! Second, let’s have a look at the health outcomes this “best” system provides for Texans and Americans generally. American life expectancy is the lowest of the developed countries. The average Canadian, with universal healthcare, will live an average of seven years longer than a Texan and that life expectancy is getting shorter. In 2021 CDC dropped American life expectancy by a full year. (Normally, changes in expectancy are in fractions of a year. In 2021 it was a full year.) Keep in mind that as a person ages their bodily systems begin to require more attention. 80% per cent of Americans get their healthcare insurance through their employers. When you retire, when your healthcare needs increase, will you still have healthcare insurance? Or will you have to pay for healthcare out of your pocket? If you still have insurance, will you have the money to pay the monthly premiums, co-pays, or deductible?The American infant/maternal mortality rate is the highest of the developed countries, 77th in the world. Like American life expectancy, the mortality rate is rising. Again, the CDC released a report in March, 2023 that found the infant/maternal mortality rate is continuing to rise. If your wife, your daughter is pregnant their life and that of their baby is on the line. Of course you will be happy to pay for the best prenatal care for your wife until, uh oh, at one of her ultrasounds they find your son has a birth defect. You live in Texas so an abortion is out of the question but that’s okay, the doctor says the problem can be taken care of surgically after he is born. Some states have an infant/maternal mortality rate equivalent to third world countries. Your wife/daughter might as well be in The Lebanon giving birth because they or their baby are as likely to die while giving birth in Beirut as in Big D.Over 600,000 American families, families just like yours, are bankrupted annually by medical expenses. Canada, with its universal healthcare, has no healthcare-related bankruptcies. Will you be able to pay for that surgery your infant son will need? Just be aware, as your wife’s doctor has told you, there are two possible procedures to deal with your son’s condition. The one he needs will give him a normal life but it is more expensive than the other option. That other procedure is all right but it will mean he will probably need other care until he is about five years old. You want the best so you’ll go with the first option. Problem is your insurer won’t pay for it, they’ll pay for the other procedure. If you want the first option you’ll have to pay for it. This is your son; have you got the money? Warning, the cost is way more than the cost to have a cavity filled; like three more zeros in the fee. If you had universal healthcare you would be worried about two people, your wife and son, not the cost of providing them with the best healthcare. So how do you like your “best system” so far? Let’s look at another real scenario. Your son is grown, living a good productive life, you love him. He is just a little more precious because he survived that surgery you paid for. You’ve forgotten that the cost bankrupted you but you still love him. Besides you and your wife have built back. It’s been tough because your monthly healthcare premiums are almost equal to your wife’s salary. Oh well, in a few years you guys will be able to retire comfortably; do some travelling, have a good retirement together. You deserve it. Your wife sees her doctor pretty regularly. Women have a more complex system. Boy, you never thought you’d survive her menopause but things are going along fine now. Well, sort of fine. Your doctor wants your wife to have some tests and they find she has cancer. Back into the hospital. With the treatment regime and chemo she should be fine. Problem is, her chemo is expensive and with hospital costs the insurance company is telling you your coverage will soon run out; the costs will be up to the million dollar cap in your policy. Then there is your 100,000 co-pay. If you want your wife to live you will have to pay for her chemo out of your pocket. Take her home and arrange for homecare none of which is covered by your insurance. All that money you saved for retirement is starting to disappear. Your son wants to help out but he just got laid-off. He has no insurance and your grandson needs surgery after breaking his leg.

None of this will happen to you even though it happens to hundreds of Americans every day. No, you are a Texan, it won’t happen to you. You and the missus head out for an evening to celebrate your retirement. It’s Texas and some yahoo with an open carry permit walks in and shoots up the restaurant, theatre, concert venue, whatever. You and your wife are hit. Both are pretty serious but after surgery, by trauma surgeon, and a few weeks in hospital you are both out. Now, you need rehabilitation that is going to be expensive. How much will your insurance cover? Anything? You and your wife are alive and looking at your second bankruptcy filing in your life. As you fill out your bankruptcy forms I bet you feel fabulous knowing that the executive at your insurance company is comfortable pulling down an eight-figure salary and “the best system . . . allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.” Oh, before you and your wife start looking for jobs, because there is no way you can afford to retire, don’t forget to sign the bankruptcy forms. It’s too bad you had to sell your house but this apartment is cheap. Besides you can go over to your son’s place this afternoon and play with your grandchildren. Life is good with the best insurance system. I wonder why Canadians, Brits, and everyone else don’t have the same system? I wonder if that is why we see so many Canadians down here in the winter?

What makes the Sámi so distinct from Europeans is not that they are mostly East Eurasian in ancestry (though they have a lot more of that than most other Europeans, with the exception of some other Uralic as well as some Turkic-speaking ethnicities from Western Russia). What really makes them stand apart is a profound effect of genetic drift (especially via genetic bottleneck followed by a large population boom, causing a drift by local founder effects) , just like what makes Finns split away from other Europeans despite a mostly very similar genetic makeup. Drift causes even similar populations, with the same origins, to become more and more different through random internal processes not mixture with outsiders, and it may be particularly fast in populations like that of the Sámi and other Northeastern European ethnicities, which seem to derive from very small groups of people that only boomed demographically in the last few millennia. To that add a distribution of genetic ancestry components that betrays a very distinct history in the lands that the forebears of the Sámi inhabited since at least 8,000 years ago in Northeastern Europe: 1) a lot less influence from the spread of cultivation and stock breeding enacted mostly by Anatolian farmers throughout most of Europe starting in ~7,000 B.C. in Greece; and 2) despite significant, but recent, genetic mixing with Norse and Finnic peoples, a lot less influence from the massive Indo-European migrations related to the Yamnaya culture of the Early Bronze Age Pontic-Caspian steppe, a long-distance movement of semi-nomadic pastoralists that expanded dramatically throughout Europe and much of Asia in several waves roughly between 3,400 and 2,500 B.C. ABOVE: Amidst more than 300 averaged population groups, these are the 25 populations that are most closely related to the Sámi. Note that no population is really close to the Sámi, probably due to strong genetic drift (the closest, the Udmurt one, has a genetic distance of 5.55%, much higher than the distance separating the English from the Germans and similar to the distance between the English and the Slovenians). The Sámi genetic makeup is to be expected if they always lived so much to the north and east of Europe, away from the best arable lands and herding pastures. A hunter-gatherer lifestyle could remain more competitive where they lived. Thus, they have a lot more European hunter-gatherer ancestry (especially Eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also Western-Central European ones), while differently most other European peoples’ genetic makeups are heavily defined by their farmer ancestry (of Anatolian background) and Indo-European herder ancestry (of Pontic-Caspian background), both of which are also a part of the origins of the Sámi, but much less markedly than even in the neighbors of the Sámi, like Norwegians, Swedes, Finns and Estonians. In the autosomal ancestry admixture graph below, notice that, apart from most Finnish individuals, virtually no other European individuals in the set have any East Eurasian-related admixture (namely, linked to the Neolithic Balkal region and the Neolithic Devil’s Cave in easternmost Russia). Conversely, they have a lot less Yamnaya admixture and Neolithic Anatolian (Barcin-N + Tepecik-Ciftlik_N) admixture. Instead, they have a lot of Eastern European hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, shown by both EHG samples and the Eneolithic Pontic-Caspian steppe samples from Khvalynsk, who were still about 80–85% EHG and only 15–20% derived from Caucasian hunter-gatherers and early pastoralists. So, the Sámi distinctiveness does not rely only on their much higher East Eurasian ancestry (mainly related to Eastern Siberia), but also on their much lower ancestry from Indo-European Yamnaya-related pastoralists and Anatolian farmers, therefore the West Eurasian part of their ancestry is also pretty distinctive."},{"instruction":"What are the disadvantages a person can have after becoming a member of a Freemason?","output":"I can think of one great disadvantage of becoming a Mason, especially should you happen to be a Scottish nationalist.

This is a thing that a lot of people find hard to comprehend, because we tend, naturally, to think of an “observer” as a “person looking at something.” In physics terms, an observer is anything whose state depends in a thermodynamically irreversible way on the state of the thing being observed. If you use an instrument to measure a particle, the instrument, not the person looking at it, is the observer. And it gets worse. Buckle up, Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye-bye. It’s not that we can’t know the absolute position and absolute momentum of a particle at the same time, it’s that a particle doesn’t have absolute position and momentum at the same time. Nothing in the macroscopic world acts like this. You probably think of a particle as a little tiny ball like a marble. It’s not. It’s fuzzy, spread out in space. It has a wavelength.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"There is no clear answer to the complex topic of whether [LINKED_TEXT: private schools in Toronto] [URL: https://rutherfordschool.ca/] are significantly superior to public ones. Different variables, such as unique situations, particular schools, and individual preferences, influence how the two types of schools are compared. When comparing the quality of education offered by private and public schools, it's critical to take many factors into account. Smaller class sizes are common in private institutions, allowing for more individualized instruction and attention. This may help certain students achieve higher academic results and a more personalized learning experience. Additionally, private schools frequently have more control over their finances and curriculum, which can result in specialized programmes, challenging courses, and improved facilities. Public schools do, however, have their own advantages. They provide opportunities for kids to interact with peers from all backgrounds and learn crucial social skills as they cater to a diverse student body. Public schools frequently offer a broader variety of organizations, sports teams, and extracurricular activities, fostering a more all-encompassing educational experience. It is important to remember that government rules and policies have an impact on curriculum selections and leadership decisions because they apply to public schools. Private schools, on the other hand, have more freedom in putting together their curriculum and can accommodate particular educational ideologies or religious connections. In the end, whether a school is public or private, the quality of the education is determined by the dedication and expertise of the teachers, the resources available, parental involvement, and the culture of the school as a whole. Families should extensively investigate and tour potential schools, consider their unique requirements and objectives, and then decide which option best fits their priorities and values."},{"instruction":"it acceptable for German actors/actresses to play a role as Nazis in a movie?","output":"Of course, it's also acceptable for non german actors/actresses to play Nazis in a movie.

You should realize that smiling is the key to success if you're dating and want to do everything you can to get a date. [LINKED_TEXT: Whiten Your Teeth Professionally Save 60% Real White Teeth Whitener] [URL: https://cutt.ly/V5v8xPt] And it's a secret that a lot of people aren't even employed. A sociologist who works at Bumble (and formerly worked at Tinder) claims that smiling makes you more approachable to potential dates. And this is just one piece of the expanding body of studies demonstrating the importance of having a beautiful grin when approaching potential dates. Why Grinning Increases Your Dateability According to Dr. David Carbinetto, smiling, has a built-in backdoor that allows you to get past a person's barriers. People typically smile back when they notice you grinning. And when they do, the activation of the grin muscles causes the release of feel-good endorphins. They will therefore be more inclined to want to spend more time with you since they identify you with feeling good. According to Dr. Carbinetto's research, smiling \\"significantly\\" affects whether or not someone is swept right. Why Don't People Smirk, Then? It's difficult to imagine that most people aren't smiling because it seems like such a natural reaction, but Dr. Carbinetto claims that this is the reality. She claims that one of the issues is that models have influenced society to believe that frowning is more appealing. There is some evidence to support this, especially for guys, and it isn't necessarily erroneous. [LINKED_TEXT: Whiten Your Teeth Professionally Save 60% Real White Teeth Whitener] [URL: https://cutt.ly/V5v8xPt] You come off as snobbish and unapproachable if you don't smile. Because of this, models in Britain began doing it more than 100 years ago. Designer Lilly wanted her models, many of whom were street people and other members of the underclass, to appear as though they belonged to the social elite so wealthy customers would want to imitate them by purchasing. It worked and still does, especially if you want to appear alluring while being by yourself. This expression may make you appear more alluring, but it can also make you appear haughty, distant, and otherwise NWTE (not worth the effort). Therefore, you should smile if you want to get dates rather than frowning if you want to look good. This is crucial for guys using apps like Bumble, where they can't initiate contact with women and must instead entice them to do so. What If You Dislike Your Smile, though? Dr. Carbinetto is unaware of the fact that many people avoid smiling because they dislike how their grin appears. They don't really have the option to smile, or at least it doesn't feel like one. People may be concerned (or may already have experienced this) that when they smile, other [LINKED_TEXT: people will be put off by their teeth] [URL: https://cutt.ly/V5v8xPt]. What is the most effective strategy to enhance your attractiveness and attract people's attention on any given day of the week? TRY LAUGHING! The upward curve of a smile is universally regarded by both sexes as the facial feature that has the greatest overall impact on a person's level of attraction to them! Women reported that they believe a person's smile to be more responsible for attractiveness when it comes to facial attraction. When men were asked what they found most attractive, a grin came in as a close second. However, the data gathered showed that hair and eyes were also top contenders when men are choosing a person's facial/aesthetic magnetism. According to the data, the grin accounts for 69% of the variation in facial attractiveness in women. On the other hand, men discovered that the heterogeneity in the evaluation of structure and facial captivation was only 49% explained by the grin alone. Men primarily focus on the combination of all these factors when evaluating face beauty, with the eyes and hair playing a significantly larger influence. According to the data, the eyes account for around 20% of the diversity in face appeal and the hair for only 6%.

Alex had always been an enthusiastic soul, known for their passion for adventure and trying new things. However, as the years went by, their weight began to take a toll on their confidence and vitality. Determined to make a change, Alex embarked on a transformative journey that would lead to shedding an astonishing 40lbs through the power of keto meal plans. Alex's story began with a realization - they needed to adopt a healthier lifestyle to regain their vigor and zest for life. After much research and consultation, they stumbled upon the ketogenic diet. This low-carb, high-fat diet intrigued Alex as it promised to put their body into a state of ketosis, where it would burn fat for fuel instead of relying on carbohydrates. With renewed determination, Alex set out to revamp their eating habits. They meticulously planned their meals, ensuring each dish was rich in healthy fats, moderate in protein, and incredibly low in carbohydrates. Their breakfasts transformed from sugary cereals to hearty omelets filled with avocado, spinach, and cheese. Lunches consisted of crisp salads topped with grilled chicken and a variety of nutrient-dense vegetables. And for dinner, Alex indulged in succulent salmon drizzled with olive oil and a side of roasted broccoli. While the beginning was challenging, with cravings for carbs occasionally testing their willpower, Alex persevered. The results started to show. Slowly but surely, the excess weight began to melt away. As the scale numbers decreased, Alex's energy levels soared. They found themselves more focused at work, and their adventurous spirit rekindled as they tackled new activities with newfound confidence. But the transformation wasn't just physical. Alex's relationship with food evolved too. They learned to appreciate the richness of natural flavors and the benefits of nourishing their body with wholesome ingredients. Snacks that once consisted of processed chips were now replaced with handfuls of nuts and slices of cheese. As the seasons changed, so did Alex's perspective. They realized that this journey was about more than just losing weight; it was about embracing a healthier way of life. The path was not without its challenges, and there were moments when doubts crept in. But Alex's commitment and the remarkable progress they had made kept them moving forward. Through their determination and the power of keto, Alex's story reached its climax - a triumphant loss of 40lbs. Their physical appearance had transformed, but more importantly, their self-confidence had soared to new heights. Their story had inspired friends, family, and even strangers who had witnessed their remarkable journey. With a heart full of gratitude, Alex embraced their new chapter. They continued to savor the delicious keto-friendly meals that had become their staple, forever thankful for the positive changes the diet had brought into their life. And so, Alex's story served as a beacon of hope for anyone seeking transformation, reminding them that with dedication, a healthy lifestyle, and the right mindset, remarkable changes are possible.

Some of the most well-known ones are: Iron Dome — A short-range system that intercepts rockets, artillery, and mortars fired by Hamas and Hezbollah. It is developed by two Israeli firms with support from the U.S. David's Sling — A medium-range system that defends against cruise missiles and lower-tier ballistic missiles. It is also developed by Israeli firms with U.S. assistance. It was deployed in operations for the first time in May 2023. SPYDER - A short and medium range system that uses Python and Derby missiles to engage aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. It is developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with assistance from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). But comparing Israel's systems, which are customized to their specific needs, to the best air defense systems in the world, depends on many factors such as performance, reliability, cost, availability, and integration. Different sources have different opinions and rankings based on their own criteria and data. According to some efforts, the best air defense system in the world is the Russian S-400 Triumf, followed by the Israeli David's Sling, the French-Italian SAMP-T complex, the U.S. Patriot, and the Chinese HQ-9. However, other sources rank the U.S. Patriot as the most effective air defense system in the world, followed by the Russian S-400, the Israeli Iron Dome, the French Aster 30 SAMP/T, and the German MEADS. There's systems have various versions and upgrades that adapt then to anticipated applications and threats so it is impossible to give a definitive answer to this question without more specific criteria and threat environment information.

This trend is anticipated to last well into next year. To lower global inflation to pre-pandemic levels, however, the currently anticipated trajectory of interest rate increases and other policy interventions may not be sufficient. Investors anticipate central banks to boost global interest rates by more than 2 percentage points over their 2021 average through 2023, to about 4 percent. The study concludes that central banks should continue their efforts to keep inflation under control since it is possible to do so without causing a worldwide recession. However, it will demand coordinated action from a range of policymakers: Central Banks - must transparently convey policy decisions while maintaining their independence. This may serve to stabilize inflation expectations and lessen the amount of tightening required. Central banks in advanced economies should be aware of the consequences of monetary tightening on other countries. They should tighten macroprudential rules in emerging markets and developing economies and increase foreign exchange reserves. Accounting authorities - will need to calibrate the removal of financial support measures with care, making sure it is consistent with monetary policy goals. It is anticipated that the percentage of nations tightening their fiscal policies in 2019 would increase to its greatest level since the early 1990s. The effects of monetary policy on growth can be amplified as a result. Additionally, decision-makers should implement dependable medium-term economic plans and offer vulnerable households specific assistance. Additional monetary policymakers - will need to join the effort to combat inflation, especially by making significant efforts to increase global supply. These consist of: - Reducing labor market restrictions Policies must work to lower pricing pressures and boost labor force participation. Policies affecting the labor market may help reallocate displaced workers. - Increasing the supply of commodities globally. The availability of food and energy may be increased significantly with global cooperation. Politicians should propose steps to cut energy usage and hasten the switch to low-carbon energy sources for commodities like energy. - Enhancing international commerce networks. To ease supply constraints around the world, policymakers should work together. They ought to be in favor of a global economic system founded on norms, one that protects trade networks from further disruption caused by fragmentation and protectionism.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","output":"My dear friend, with all due respect I believe it is a propaganda in order to save themselves from a shame of accepting their flows, heavy blow to their egoistic beliefs and losing power due to conversion from Ambedkar and their followers. In my personal opinion, Ambedkar not only rejected Hinduism, but he rejected religion all together. I understand it is A DIFFICULT concept to handle, when he himself converted to Buddhism but let me explain this a bit Depressed class was denied basic right under systematic oppresion in Hindusm.They lost thinking and organizational power altogether.They were too backward to accept No religion.They were systematically kept poor and depended by showing them wrong God and leaving all such fears wasn't possible without any other God.Even depressed class follow untouchability amongst themselves and few consider themselves above others which is why they were hesitant to leave that even if they could.Ambedkar realized the fact organizing and agitating them is not possible without GOD. That is the sole reason he studied all the religion stumbled upon Buddhism which is Most humanistic religion ever born. In My Personal opinion if one study any religion not only Hinduism, every single religion fails on the current social morals. Buddhism is a futuristic religion based on equality and humanity. which is the sole reason he accepted it as a compramise and way out of hindusm. if it were to ambedkar and ambedkar only, he would have rejected religion altogther."},{"instruction":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","output":"Disk information is retrieved by capturing latent magnetic images from the surface of the drive.

However, determining the \\"most advanced\\" technology can be subjective and depends on various factors such as the field of application, complexity, and impact on society. Here are a few technologies that are often considered as some of the most advanced inventions of all time: Internet: The Internet is a global network of computers that enables the exchange of information and communication across the world. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and learn, and has connected people from all corners of the globe.Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, and decision-making. AI has transformed industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, and is poised to drive significant advancements in the future.Quantum computing: Quantum computing is a new type of computing that leverages quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform complex computations that are not possible with classical computers. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization.Space travel: Space travel involves sending humans and machines beyond the Earth's atmosphere to explore and study space. It has enabled significant discoveries and advancements in astronomy, astrophysics, and other scientific fields, and has paved the way for future exploration and colonization of space. Overall, it's difficult to determine the most advanced technology as there are many different types of technologies, each with its unique capabilities and potential for impact."},{"instruction":"Was it just me, or did the Martian Manhunter scene at the end of the Snyder Cut of Justice League feel unneeded?","output":"Personally the way i see it it’s the Martian Manhunter trying to manipulate the situation He masquerades himself as Martha to get Lois to get back to work, and eventually being there in the park when Superman revived. If Lois wasn’t there, Superman would’ve raged further and killed many people to the point of no return Thanks to Martian Manhunter, Lois got out of her house and shows up at the right exact moment to save Superman’s mind. How did he know? In the comic, one of Martian Manhunter’s senses is Precognition My guess is that he foresaw this event, and knows what he must do. So how does this connects to his appearance at the end of Snyder Cut? Another one of Manhunter’s powers is telepathy and projection. Before MM arrived, Bruce had a nightmare of a future world Then he wakes up to see MM in the front door My theory? all those nightmares aren’t nightmares, they are telepathic projection. Bruce saw what Manhunter wants him to see. a vision of the future that he foresaw. All the Knightmare sequence he kept seeing in his dreams are all Martian Manhunter’s doing. And he conveniently shows up at his front door, and tells him this and again, conveniently offered his help. He was manipulating Bruce to accept him to the Justice League, and possibly look for more defenders. Was it unneeded? in a sense that it sets up a sequel that we will never see? yes. But in a grand scale of things, it’s somewhat of a bonus reveal. that Martian Manhunter was behind mostly everything. But then again, it’s just a guess. I’m not sure if this MM has the same powers as the comic version."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"There are several good cars under 10 lakhs in India, and the best one for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

Let me cite it with a true example. My father is a shop owner in india(tier 3 city) and whenever I visit my town,I sit with him for 3 hours daily just to help him with his work. Ours is a wholesale shop and there is lot of scope for bargaining and we decide the price according to personality ,body language, and style of talking and our relations with our customer.Suppose a candle is priced 20 1. A customer comes to buy 12 candles.I will see the way he talks,and how confidently he talks. If he is a regular customer of ours he will talk in a very confident way bcoz he knows the price which I will charge him that is 16 for one candle. So 16 × 12 = 192 for 12 candlesHe seems to be normal and has no anxiety on his face and body language seems to be alright so I judge him believing that he is our regular customer and he knows the price so I cannot charge him anything more than 16.So I charge him 16. (I visit my hometown only twice a year so I dont know who really our customers are,I have no other option rather than judging them based on their body language and confidence) 2. Comes a 2nd manHe asks for the price of 12 candles..I say him 18. He then bargains, to which I very politley deny selling beyond 17.5Looking at his personality and confidence in his voice, I judge him that at what price I can settle the deal and accordingly I settle it.Since I found this man grtting confused in his own tone.Rythm of tone varying and is not firm at his price, it seems he just wants to bargain and that too he doesnot appear to be good in bargaining. I quote my final price of 18 an he has nothing but to accept my quote.And ends up paying. All the prices that I offer are based on the person's confidence and body language.Sometimes I have to sell lesser than my least price 16.5 because the customer talks me in such a way ,denting me impressed and confused. Self confidence helps you a lot for your business to grow and will give you some added benefits which others dont seem to enjoy. If you have nothing but confidence on self, you can do anything.People judge you by your self confidence. The world is stereotypical and judgemental. The first and the foremost thing people will judge you will be based on your body language. Your body language is representation of your confidence. Your walking style,position of head, placement of shoulders,eye contact, feet movement. All represent your confidence. Self confidence results in positive body language and positive body language results in greater self confidence. **FAKE IT TILL YOU BECOME IT**- amy cuddy Check out TED TALK OF AMY CUDDY Self confidence will help you in every aspect of your life.Be it cracking deals, proposing your dream girl, talking a stranger, landing a job or whatever be it.

Water is also very dispersive and lossy. Here is a plot of the complex dielectric constant as a function of frequency [math]f[/math]. Your AM radio frequencies are around 0.5 - 1.6 MHz so that puts you almost exactly at the far left side of these plots. This was taken from Kaatze U 1997 The dielectric properties of water in its different states of interaction J. Solut. Chem. 26 1049–112. It says that the complex permittivity for AM radio frequencies is [math]epsilon_{rm{r}} = 80 + i7[/math] Assuming a negligible permeability, the complex refractive index is [math]n = sqrt{epsilon_{rm{r}}} = 8.95 + i0.39[/math] The real part of the complex refractive index is called the ordinary refractive index [math]n_{rm{o}}[/math] and is what most people say when they say “refractive index.” This quantity describes the speed and phase accumulation of a wave as it propagates through the medium. The imaginary part of the complex refractive index [math]kappa[/math] is called the extinction coefficient. This quantity describes the loss, or decay, of a wave as it propagates through the medium. Based on these quantities, the amplitude of a wave as it propagates through the medium is [math]E(z) = E_0 e^{i k_0 n z} = E_0 e^{- k_0 kappa z} e^{i k_0 n_{rm{o}} z}[/math] [math]k_0[/math] is the free space wave number. You can take this a bit further and look at the skin depth [math]delta[/math], which is a measure of how far the wave will penetrate into the medium. This is calculated from [math]kappa[/math] according to [math]delta = frac{1}{k_0 kappa} = frac{2 pi f}{c_0} kappa = frac{2 pi (10^6)}{3 times 10^8} (0.39) = 8.2[/math] mm So AM radio waves will not propagate very far in water! Sea water is even worse. EDIT: It appears I goofed and mixed up 1.5 MHz for 1.5 GHz.

They relied on a study that showed that any random pattern was enough to break up the human body, it didn’t need to duplicate the background. Based on that, they thought they could do reduce the number of camouflage patterns needed. Why are they getting rid of it? Because it turned out that the study they based digital camo on was garbage. The US Armed Services have since changed to Operational Camouflage Pattern which is much closer to traditional camouflage."},{"instruction":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","output":"Sure, here are some tips on how to earn 1,000 or more per month as a freelancer: Identify your skills and services: Start by identifying the skills and services you can offer as a freelancer.

The sheeple believe that their country is ruled by a legitimate government based on a mandate from the people. Sovereign citizens know this is false, the government got bankrupt in the Great Depression or following one of the World Wars or whatever and shadowy bankers foreclosed on the country, including the citizens. Well not exactly, the bank owns a person’s strawman, a legal entity associated with the person. And laws apply to the strawman not the person. And all judges know that but they are an active part of the charade. And one way they fool people is by having admiralty courts judge matters over which they have no jurisdiction. This is betrayed by the fact that there is a tassled flag in the court. Dizzying, right?

We had a big Halloween party and when everyone left I went to check on my 14 year old daughter… she’s not in her bed. I tear the house apart looking for her, she’s nowhere. I call her dad (I’m divorced) and he searches the woods by our house and after about an hour of making sure she’s not in the house, and me finding her phone outside in the grass, I call police. They search the house, I’m sure assuming I’m drunk and just lost a kid. I tell them several blankets and pillows are missing but my daughter is very ocd, there’s no way she brought her blankets to the forest. They tell me she probably ran off with a boy or whatever and I’m over here like not my kid, she wouldn’t have left her phone, she’s not in the woods she’s afraid of the dark still.., I’m hysterical thinking someone wrapped her in her blankets and kidnapped her, dropping the phone on the way… I’m a mess! Nope… apparently the party was loud, so this kid unscrewed the wood slats in her bed and turned it into a coffin and slid the mattress back like nothing. She was inside of the furniture!

No, Izuku is nowhere near Goku's power, even on Izuku's best day and Goku's worst. However, the very nature of Goku's power means that he could reduce it as much as he wants to at any given time. If he can reduce it so much that he can be bruised by a bullet from a pistol, he can absolutely choose to lower it to the point where Deku could one-shot him. I am in no way saying that Deku is stronger than Goku, in fact if you actually read the answer I'm saying the exact opposite. Edit 2, copied from an earlier comment: Hopefully I won't have to clarify this again on this answer but I'm not arguing that Deku would beat Goku, because he wouldn't and not by a long shot. Rather I'm saying that there is a specific circumstance entirely within the power of both characters where Deku could beat Goku, and that difference is important. Whether they know they're fighting each other, want to fight each other, or have the ability to quickly raise their defenses is irrelevant to the conversation. The question was about a possible scenario, not a probable one, and that's what I answered. It'd be dishonest for me to deny it just because I like Goku more than Deku. The real answer begins below. ——————————— Goku is naturally very strong even at rest, but his defenses weaken significantly when he's off guard. This is because he lowers his power when he believes the battle is won, in order to avoid exhausting himself unnecessarily (and probably also to avoid destroying his surroundings by accident). He has, in the past, acclimated to an elevated state (Super Saiyan during the Cell saga) to the point where the form didn't stress him at all, but he still reverts back to normal and lowers his power to this day. Now to be clear, in his base form Goku is still many times Universal level, but even after achieving this power he's shown to take damage from weak attacks if he's goofing around. Examples: bruised from a normal round from a pistol after catching a full clip from an assault rifle with no issue. And of course, being injured by Sorbet's Bad Ring Laser after having a universal level fight with Frieza. Now to be fair, Sorbet's Laser was made with some of the most advanced technology in the known universe, but that doesn't discount the fact that this only worked after Goku relaxed from fighting Frieza. Goku could be “off guard” and reduce his power to such a level that anything could hurt him. That includes Deku, especially using the powers of One For All. ——————————— Postscript; hopefully the final edit. If you've finished reading the answer, I ask that you read it one more time and really think about what is being said. A lot of the comments are either completely misinterpreting what I'm saying, or are showing a lack of understanding of a basic element of Dragon Ball's power system. Either way, I'd rather not have to keep coming back to clarify. The important parts are in bold."},{"instruction":"Why does the UK want the Scilly Islands?

If the answer is a government office, they will be interested in you paying for the license, and will not care whether you are a theist. As far as the actual marriage ceremony, all States allow this to be done by others than religious figures. Depending on the State, this could be a judge, justice of the peace, CPA, or certain elected officials. In some states, a friend can obtain status as a wedding officiant without having any religious connection. And in a few States a couple can simply marry themselves in front of witnesses without the involvement of anyone. In short there are plenty of non-religious legal options to be married.

There was no such thing as GPS or “glass” with moving maps and such. So, to my point, in a high-workload environment, automation is a godsend for pilots—if you are not fumbling for charts, plates or turning several knobs, you can focus your attention elsewhere. As another mentioned, the auto-pilot mostly flies the plane today because it can do a better job than the pilot. For example, I believe a couple of major airlines require the autopilot to be engaged by 500 feet on departure. The downside is that many believe automation can also be negative. An example is USAir Flight 427 where the crew experienced an uncommanded roll and the plane basically flipped on its back. The crew was unsuccessful in recovering from the unusual attitude. From what I hear, there was more panic on the flight deck than there was a “raw skills” attempt to correct the situation—but I wasn’t there. In contrast, look at the “Miracle on the Hudson.” In this situation, the crew relied on basic flying skills to land the aircraft as they did. The captain at the controls was a former Air Force F-4 fighter pilot and no doubt his raw flying skills came into play for the successful outcome. The one thing I do know is that most incidents involve complacency of some sort. Sometimes, pilots (rarely) become too familiar with the standard routine of the airplane doing the flying for them. Here, when faced with an unusual situation where they have to override automation and revert to basic flying, there may be some room for improvement in their ongoing training."},{"instruction":"What is the strangest convention you've ever been to?","output":"Actually it was one I stumbled upon.

Although it could, of course, have been written in languages like Fortran, Algol or Pascal (unlikely) or assembly (a far bigger job than BCPL) I think not. Although Algol and Pascal would certainly have been feasible, they are from a completely different branch of programming linguistics and I don’t think they were probable choices. BCPL, although different from C, is at least based on similar premise, and would be a logical choice I think. Of course, having done this kind of thing myself (writing a compiler for a language in another one at first) it is highly likely that your early goal with the compiler would be to get to the point where you can translate your compiler source code into your new language, and verify (to some extent) the validity of your language and compiler design by compiling your compiler in itself, and so to ensure that your compiler, written in its own language, works correctly (eating your own dogfood).

The highest speed before disintegration is unknown. The engine inlets are temperature limited and the SR71 without the Digital Autopilot had a propensity to pitch up. It came apart and left the flight crew literally in a flight over the United States. The guy in back was found to have a broken neck when the stabilizing and main chutes brought them down. I think the fastest reported was 2400 temporarily retreating from interceptions before they brought back the throttles.I don’t know what Mach that is for them that day because I don’t know the altitude or OAT. That was not a sustained speed. 12 aircraft were lost Nd none to ground fire. 4 were to unstarts which were very violent events. The faster the aircraft goes the more violent the unstarts and so itwas playing with Fire. The sustained record was 2092 mph for an official speed record. It is interesting to note that at Mach cruise fuel consumption goes down the greateryou go up in speed. Although people would say the SR71 was needed for faster positioning than satellites it took many hours to process film and go over it ONCE ITGOT BACK to a suitable lab. And remember there are 3 entities producing thrust per side. The inlet, the engine, and the turkey feather nozzle, seperate from the Afterburner nozzle. Since the inlet produces most of the thrust, if you lost a shock wave and had an unstart you might exceed the ability to recover at some point. Again 4 aircraft were lost to unstarts alone.

What to do?","output":"When I was dealing with this I just inundated myself with positive audio. What we hear and see affects us whether we realize it or not. I have to be careful about what I watch and listen to, including show/movies that might be well made but not beneficial. I listen to audiobooks on mental health (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is my fave), positive music, and have an app called Meditative Minds. These are great tools that help. Also, try to identify things that drain you. Often times you can do that just by thinking of someone or something and taking note of the emotions and physical responses to those thought. I had to cut things out of my life to see an improvement. You can also tell your brain what to do. Looking in the mirror and saying things out loud will allow your brain to see and hear you saying positive things. It will create better internal dialogue. Sounds silly but it works. I’ve even cried in front of a mirror before telling myself it’s ok to cry and that I accept the sadness. Being mindful about what effects you is half the battle. It’s hard to learn to swim when you are drowning. Practicing these things in better times will prepare you when the harder times hit. Also, David McPhee’s answer is wonderful as usual.

No they do not. MREs are field rations, and fill the same role that C rations did in the past. While the two differ a lot the basic concept is still the same. The origin of the term C ration will explain the way the military handles rations. The term C ration came about just before World War II and was used until the 1980s. A rations were food cooked in the mess hall with mostly fresh ingredients. B rations were cooked in a field kitchen so they were mostly canned and dehydrated C rations were rations that the troops carried with them on their rucksack and prepared themselves with minimal equipment in the field. In the early 1980s, the C ration started to get replaced by the MRE and the military started eating dehydrated bagged meals out in the field. On base there is more to eat than rationed food.

A series of explosions shook the city of St. Louis on March 16, 1972. The first building fell to the ground at 3 p.m. that afternoon. In the months that followed, more than 30 buildings would be turned to rubble. The buildings that were destroyed were part of the now infamous housing project known as Pruitt-Igoe. When the Pruitt-Igoe housing project opened in 1954 it was believed to be a breakthrough in urban architecture. Spanning 57 acres across the north side of St. Louis, Pruitt-Igoe consisted of 33 high-rise buildings and provided nearly 3,000 new apartments to the surrounding population. Pruitt-Igoe was designed with cutting-edge ideas from modern architecture. The designers emphasized green spaces and packed residents into high-rise towers with beautiful views of the surrounding city. The buildings employed skip-stop elevators, which only stopped at the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth floors. (Architects believed that forcing people to use the stairs would lessen the foot traffic and congestion in the building.) The buildings were outfitted with “unbreakable” lights that were covered in metal mesh and intended to reduce vandalism. The floors featured communal garbage chutes and large windows to brighten the corridors with natural light. On paper, Pruitt-Igoe was a testament to modern engineering. In practice, the project was a disaster. The Pruitt-Igoe Failure Once the troublemakers of the neighborhood heard that the light fixtures were supposedly unbreakable, they accepted the challenge and threw water on the lights until they overheated and burnt out. Next, they busted the garbage chutes and shattered the windows. According to one report, the bright new corridors had so many broken windows that “it was possible to see straight through to the other side.” The St. Louis Housing Authority had planned to use rental incomes to pay for the maintenance of the buildings. In the years after the massive project opened, the population of St. Louis began to drop as people moved out of the city. With fewer tenants than expected and increasing rates of vandalism, the buildings were left unfixed. Soon the modern design of Pruitt-Igoe began to accelerate its downfall. Suddenly, the skip-stop elevators became a danger to well-behaved citizens who were forced to walk through additional corridors and risky stairways just to get into and out of their apartments. As criminal activity rose, more things were broken, more people moved away, and less money came in. In 1972, less than 20 years after the project had opened, the St. Louis Housing Authority scheduled a demolition and blew up the entire 36 million complex. This iconic image of the Pruitt-Igoe demolition with the St. Louis arch in the background became a symbol of the failure of modern architecture and urban renewal. (Image Source: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) Old Ideas Are Undervalued The sprawling 33-building, 57-acre layout of Pruitt-Igoe ignored the traditional knowledge about how cities grow and develop. Nearly every thriving and successful city on our planet was built organically and unpredictably. Buildings popped up as needed. City blocks expanded gradually. There is a reason we tend to undervalue old ideas: At first glance, we just see an idea that has been around for a long time. We incorrectly assume that familiar ideas provide average results. “Everyone does it this way, so it can’t be that great … right?” What we fail to understand is that the fundamentals are not merely a collection of good ideas. The fundamentals are a collection of good ideas that outlasted thousands of bad ideas. For example: Fitness. Decades have seen the rise and fall of countless exercise fads. New training styles come into vogue, only to be replaced by another a few years later. In our quest to get fit we chase the latest and greatest offering even though boring fundamentals like lifting weights three times per week or going for a daily walk have outlasted all the previous fads.Entrepreneurship. Simple fundamentals like making more sales calls can be the difference between success and failure as an entrepreneur. As Patrick McKenzie, CEO of Starfighter, says “Our secret weapon is patient execution of what everyone knows they should be doing, because that actually is a competitive barrier.”Reading. Half of this year’s best-selling books are filled with ideas that may seem intelligent today, but will be proven wrong in the near future. Only a handful will still be read consistently a decade from now. These books—the ones that stand the test of time—are the ones you want to be reading because they are filled with ideas that last. This is why old books can provide incredible value. The Power of Inherited Knowledge Across the street from Pruitt-Igoe was more traditional housing complex named Carr Square Village. Unlike Pruitt-Igoe, Carr Square Village was a smaller, low-rise complex and featured more traditional designs. It was built 12 years before Pruitt-Igoe, but despite its older age, Carr Square Village outlasted Pruitt-Igoe and boasted lower crime and vacancy rates all while being in the same neighborhood. Is this evidence that we should abandon creative thinking and innovation in the name of sticking to the fundamentals? Of course not. But I do believe the Pruitt-Igoe story is one example of our tendency to undervalue inherited knowledge. Furthermore, I’d like to propose that sometimes the creative thing to do is to actually practice the fundamentals more consistently than everyone else. Most people don’t fully use the knowledge they already have. “Everybody already knows that” is very different from “Everybody already does that.” ATB!"},{"instruction":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","output":"MacArthur Park sung by Richard harris"},{"instruction":"Which DTH offers more Tamil channels, Sun Direct or Tata Sky?","output":"Off course [LINKED_TEXT: Tatasky DTH] [URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=Tatasky%20madhapur&oq=Tatasky%20madhapur&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i13j0i8i10i13i30j0i8i13i30l3.18143j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&tbs=lf%3A1%2Clf_ui%3A4&tbm=lcl&sxsrf=ALeKk00PD5ecyPqgB3Hcr7cC35_SQWpoWA%3A1610421187712&rflfq=1&num=10&rldimm=17406506020080055358&lqi=ChBUYXRhc2t5IG1hZGhhcHVyIgOIAQFI95LDmIqvgIAIWiEKB3RhdGFza3kQABgAGAEiEHRhdGFza3kgbWFkaGFwdXI&ved=2ahUKEwjt3tO2tpXuAhWGwTgGHQSvAQ0QvS4wAHoECAIQIA&rlst=f#rlfi%3Dhd%3A%3Bsi%3A14941416542606852730%2Cl%2CChBUYXRhc2t5IG1hZGhhcHVyIgOIAQFaGwoHdGF0YXNreSIQdGF0YXNreSBtYWRoYXB1cg%3Bmv%3A%5B%5B17.5438416%2C78.5014472%5D%2C%5B17.3294796%2C78.346029%5D%5D] is providing more south Indian channels like Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and kannada channels.

The lock gates are closed. Suddenly, the crew of the barge go completely mad and throw the iron pellets into the water. The water level does not go up. In fact it goes DOWN. The reason is that when something is floating it displaces its own weight in water but when it is submerged it displaces only its own volume in water. Since iron has a density of about 7.9 grams per cubic centimetre and water has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimetre, when the iron is floating it displaces more water than when it is at the bottom of the lock. So the level of the water in the lock goes down."},{"instruction":"Are atoms observable? If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","output":"Are atoms observable?

Superpowers and influential countries exert considerable political, economic, and military influence on global events. Multinational corporations, especially those in industries like technology, finance, and energy, also wield substantial power due to their global reach and economic impact. These companies can influence governments, drive economic policies, and shape consumer behaviors. International organizations such as the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Health Organization (WHO) play essential roles in promoting global cooperation, setting standards, and addressing global issues. In addition to these institutional entities, influential individuals, such as billionaires, philanthropists, and media moguls, can also have significant impact and reach in shaping public opinion and influencing various spheres of society. It's important to note that power dynamics can be fluid and subject to change over time. Different regions, industries, and historical contexts can lead to variations in the sources of power and influence in different parts of the world. Ultimately, the question of who truly \\"runs\\" the world is complex and multi-faceted, and there is no single entity or group that holds absolute control. Rather, power is distributed and dynamic, shaped by a combination of political, economic, social, and technological factors."},{"instruction":"plan to represent myself in court and consider myself extremely versatile so I should be able to win it. However, if you could give me one piece of advice, what would it be?","output":"Are you innocent? Are you right in your argument? Do you know whom you are up against?

Who warns us to beware of the fitnah, ie, hardships, tests, trials, etc. that does not only affect the guilty? And The God has also given us that which we need to form a decision about anything, it's called istaqara prayer: (Jabir bin Abdullah said: The Prophet used to teach us to seek Allah's Counsel in all matters, as he used to teach us a Surah (chapter) from The Qur'an. He would say: “When anyone of you has an important matter to decide, let him pray two Rak'ahs other than the obligatory prayer, and then say: (O The God, I seek the counsel of Your Knowledge, and I seek the help of Your Omnipotence, and I beseech You for Your Magnificent Grace. Surely, You are Capable and I am not. You know and I know not, and You are The Knower of the unseen. O The God, if You know that this matter – (mention the matter, in this case, you representing yourself) – is good for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare in the life to come in both the short term and the long term – in this life and the afterlife – then ordain it for me and make it easy for me, then bless me in it. And if You know that this matter is bad for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare in the life to come in both the short term and the long term – in this life and the afterlife – then distance it from me, and distance me from it, and ordain for me what is good wherever it may be, and help me to be content with it)) (source - Al-Bukhari 7/162, Al-'Imran 3:159-Doa & Zikr (Hisnul Muslim): ([LINKED_TEXT: Doa & Zikr Hisnul Muslim - Apps on Google Play] [URL: https://goo.gl/IFvgJW]) And the words speak for themselves, that one totally puts their trust in The God to make the best decision.

Facilitate my affairs in the right way. Lay not on me that which I can not take. Guide me through this. To see clearly. Protect me. I feel that I can do this myself. But if You know that it is better for me to have another represent me, the send to me the best person/s. Help me to put my trust in You and to recognize Your Guidance.” Then, go forward, do as much research as you can. Inquire about representatives. See and research whom you will be up against. And know yourself. Don't be overconfident, arrogant, lazy, etc. And if you can't reach the level of knowledge that you will need in order to represent yourself, which most can't because it takes years of study. Trial and error. Experience. Knowing your audience. When to speak and when not to. How to handle yourself under pressure. When others are clearly not speaking the truth. False witness.

They are not directly proportional in some cases. SRK definitely has not evolved as an actor since his initial days And remains at best an average actor but his charmth and warmth accompanying his trend-setting/breaking script choices( anti-hero saga and whatnot) as a bollywood novice can certainly sum up his swelling reputation as one of the biggest stars of bollywood industry. Back then, bollywood didn’t have much finery to offer and art-oriented actors weren’t considered ‘heros’ for obvious , and of course, unfair, reasons. Even olden bollywood had some greatly celebrated actors who, in today’s advancement of arts, wouldn’t be considered so brilliant. It is an honour given to the actors for how they had impacted an audience in a given phase of time. Audiences mature, audiences change. It is undeniable that for a long long time, SRK has been considered the face of bollywood internationally. His contemporaries like Akshay Kumar and Aamir Khan didn’t have a thing or two working for them back then, be it audience appeal or movie choices and for the things that did work out for them, they are two of the best stars in senior Bollywood league now. Then there was Salman Khan and there is Salman Khan, SRK isn’t going off the charts anytime soon.

There are so many online tutorials, practice problems, and coding competitions out there that it can be hard to know where to start. To avoid getting bogged down in all the options, I suggest picking one or two reputable sources and sticking with them until you feel comfortable branching out. For me, the best way to learn was through practice. I started with simple coding challenges and worked my way up to more difficult problems as I became more confident. I took help from Logicmojo course, by solving 400+ question, where all the all the possible cases being covered.I also found it helpful to participate in coding competitions, as they provided a way to measure my progress and get feedback from other programmers. One of my favorite coding competitions was the Google Code Jam, which has a great community of supportive and talented programmers. Here are a few tips to help you get started: Learn the basics Before you dive into competitive programming, make sure you have a solid foundation in programming basics. This includes data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. You can find plenty of online resources to help you brush up on these topics, including online courses and programming blogs. Practice, practice, practice The best way to get better at competitive programming is to practice consistently. Start with easy problems and work your way up to more challenging ones. There are many online platforms that offer practice problems and contests, such as Logicmojo, Codeforces, HackerRank, and CodeChef. Join a community Competitive programming can be a lonely endeavor, but it doesn't have to be. Joining a community of like-minded programmers can provide motivation, support, and feedback. You can find communities on social media platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Facebook. Participate in competitions Competitions are a great way to put your skills to the test and measure your progress. There are many coding competitions held throughout the year, such as the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), Google Code Jam, and Topcoder. Remember, getting started in competitive programming is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time, effort, and persistence to improve your skills and reach your goals.

Global currency traders determine the relative value of most currencies, and DXY is typical, the dollar in relation to a basket of six other global currencies. The US as a country does nothing to influence the value of the dollar other than to be fiscally responsible. A long-term chart of the dollar will show when the US was, and was not responsible as the dollar declines during periods of irresponsibility and increases during periods of responsibility. A weak dollar is said “to be good for US exports,” but in reality the US imports far more products and goods than it exports, and most of its exports are farm products, weapons systems, and Boeing airplanes, so the “benefits” of a lower dollar are limited while the costs of a lower dollar in terms of the increased cost of imports like crude oil are spread across the whole of the economy, and they can be devastating.

Ultimately one time will come when the fissile comtent and the excess reactivity of the fuel will reduce to such a level that it can not sustain the fission chain reaction. On that occasion, we need to remove the spent fuel and relplace it by new fuel. This process is called Refueling. Most of the pressurized water reactor in the world are operated for a specific time period of 12–18 months and then it undergoes refueling for a period of 1.5 months and again restarted. But in the case of Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor and CANDU reactor, there is one unique feature of On power refueling.

Remember that you may have ‘stumbled’ into medicine for other reasons than your own true self would have wanted so it is no point in comparing yourself with fellow colleagues who walk the walk and talk the talk because they were born to do it. I on the other hand wanted to go into another direction yet I chose this and I do not have regrets as much as I wish I had made other choices within this field and someone to guide me through it. So my first tip, if you start asking yourself whether it is worth becoming a doctor this is a sign for you to get a mentor asap.Whilst you are looking for a mentor (or even career advisor) be content and find happiness in the current role you are in. If you are not, then look for ways to move to something else within medicine. Once you master step one, you will stop feeling guilty all the time and it becomes easier to actually find something you do find worthwhile within medicine because there are just so much avenues to pursue. For instance, after I had a burnout, I discovered I had a passion for clinical editing and I found it was a very rewarding and worthy role for me.Finding worthiness in being a doctor comes in different forms. Do you want to feel worthy because you help patients, make healthcare decisions, enhance educational material or develop prevention plans for workers and employers. There are many facets of being a doctor and finding worth in your job means you find what you know you are worthy of from yourself. In my example, I enjoyed many aspects of being a doctor except the part when I had to put on a surgical mask. I discovered I have some form of ‘phobia’ for those masks and would always nearly have some form of panic attack every time I had to put on a surgical mask. I felt so guilty that I was not a proper doctor because I could not handle something like a mask on my face that after I graduated I naturally did not apply for any role that would involve me having to wear masks. I then tried various roles and had I found a mentor earlier on in my career I may have been able to find worthiness in my role as a doctor and probably would have prevented my burnout.Do not keep fooling yourself. Being a doctor is hard work, it comes with tremendous responsibility and the worth you find in that would be enough to last a lifetime, but you need to keep it going, the hard work, the dedication and self-reflection. It is continuous and so you cannot define worthiness of being a doctor as a snapshot moment, it fluctuates constantly So I am not sure if this answers your question, but only you can find worthiness in your role as a doctor and it comes from having made your own informed choice as to what type of doctor you want to become."},{"instruction":"w can we hold the government more accountable for decisions that benefit corporations at the expense of the American people?

Even though the temperature outside the aircraft at that altitude hovers around -70 degrees F, the sheer friction of flying at Mach 3+ heats the leading edges of the SR-71 to 800 degrees F. To help withstand this kinetic heat, the Blackbird's airframe is built almost entirely of titanium and is finished in a special heat-emitting black paint, which helps to cool the aircraft and gives it its nickname. The SR-71 can operate for about an hour at top speed before it needs refueling. So before the engines self-destroy, the SR 71 might start melting or run out of fuel. Studies have shown that when the aircraft is cruising at Mach 3 or above only about 25 percent of the total thrust is produced by the engines themselves. The balance is produced by the unique design of the engine inlet and housing, which is equipped with special afterburners. The SR71’s official record was set on 28 July 1976 by then-Capt. Eldon W. Joersz and then-Maj. George T. Morgan Jr. (RSO) taking the bird up to 2,193.2 Mph or 3,529.6 Km/H. They flew the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird #61-7958 out of Beale AFB, US. However, SR-71 pilot Brian Shul reported in his book “The Untouchables” that he flew in excess of Mach 3.5 on 15 April 1986, over Libya, in order to avoid a missile."},{"instruction":"What happens if a person who orders pizza takes the pizza and refuses to pay?","output":"I don't think this really happened to me because I have sense enough to never give the product up until I'm paid.

IndiGo, which took over 30 percent of Jet's domestic slots available in Delhi and Mumbai airports, posted its highest-ever quarterly profit at Rs 1,203 crore in Q1FY20. This was 43 times higher than the profit in the year-ago period. SpiceJet, which acquired 63 domestic and international slots of Jet, also posted its highest-ever quarterly profit in Q1FY20, after reporting a loss in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal. Since the grounding of Jet, players like Indigo, SpiceJet have taken a front seat and are filling in the slots of Jet.

Let me cite it with a true example. My father is a shop owner in india(tier 3 city) and whenever I visit my town,I sit with him for 3 hours daily just to help him with his work. Ours is a wholesale shop and there is lot of scope for bargaining and we decide the price according to personality ,body language, and style of talking and our relations with our customer.Suppose a candle is priced 20 1. A customer comes to buy 12 candles.I will see the way he talks,and how confidently he talks. If he is a regular customer of ours he will talk in a very confident way bcoz he knows the price which I will charge him that is 16 for one candle. So 16 × 12 = 192 for 12 candlesHe seems to be normal and has no anxiety on his face and body language seems to be alright so I judge him believing that he is our regular customer and he knows the price so I cannot charge him anything more than 16.So I charge him 16. (I visit my hometown only twice a year so I dont know who really our customers are,I have no other option rather than judging them based on their body language and confidence) 2. Comes a 2nd manHe asks for the price of 12 candles..I say him 18. He then bargains, to which I very politley deny selling beyond 17.5Looking at his personality and confidence in his voice, I judge him that at what price I can settle the deal and accordingly I settle it.Since I found this man grtting confused in his own tone.Rythm of tone varying and is not firm at his price, it seems he just wants to bargain and that too he doesnot appear to be good in bargaining. I quote my final price of 18 an he has nothing but to accept my quote.And ends up paying. All the prices that I offer are based on the person's confidence and body language.Sometimes I have to sell lesser than my least price 16.5 because the customer talks me in such a way ,denting me impressed and confused. Self confidence helps you a lot for your business to grow and will give you some added benefits which others dont seem to enjoy. If you have nothing but confidence on self, you can do anything.People judge you by your self confidence. The world is stereotypical and judgemental. The first and the foremost thing people will judge you will be based on your body language. Your body language is representation of your confidence. Your walking style,position of head, placement of shoulders,eye contact, feet movement. All represent your confidence. Self confidence results in positive body language and positive body language results in greater self confidence. **FAKE IT TILL YOU BECOME IT**- amy cuddy Check out TED TALK OF AMY CUDDY Self confidence will help you in every aspect of your life.Be it cracking deals, proposing your dream girl, talking a stranger, landing a job or whatever be it.
