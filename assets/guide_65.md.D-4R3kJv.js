After all, you want to be able to use it for years and make money from it as well. Transferring a domain name is relatively easy. All you need is to find someone who can provide you with the legal paperwork and transfer the domain to them. To help you with this task, here are the three main steps to take: Registration - When a person registers a domain, it is also called a domain name. A domain name is the actual address of your website, which is what people will type into their browsers when they try to access your website. Domain Name - You have now registered your domain name. When someone enters your domain name in a search engine, you will be notified that your website has been found. Transfer of Ownership - You now need to find the person who is going to own your domain name. This person will need to take ownership of the domain, which is how they will be able to transfer it to you. Transfer of Registration - Once you have taken ownership of the domain name, it is now your responsibility to find the owner of your domain. To do this, you need to fill out an online form. It's important to find a reputable domain registrar who can provide you with the necessary information to perform the transfers. While it is important to find a good registrar, be sure to check the reputation of the company before you register your domain. Transfer of Name - This step is also quite simple. Just be sure that you get the proper registration and transfer of ownership form so that the transfer goes smoothly. Transfer of Registration - This is the third step. Here, you will need to do the following things: Transfer of Name - When a person registers a domain name, it is also called a domain name.

It is not accurate to pinpoint a single group or organization that controls all aspects of global affairs. However, there are several key players and influential entities that shape the world to varying degrees: 1. Governments and political leaders: Governments hold significant power and authority in their respective countries and play a crucial role in making policies, enacting laws, and representing their citizens on the global stage. Political leaders and politicians have varying degrees of influence in shaping national and international agendas. 2. International organizations: Entities like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), and regional organizations such as the European Union (EU) and African Union (AU) play important roles in global governance, diplomacy, economic cooperation, and humanitarian efforts. 3. Corporations and businesses: Multinational corporations, large companies, and influential business leaders exert considerable economic influence globally. They impact industries, trade, and investment, and often have significant lobbying power and influence over policy decisions. 4. Financial institutions: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States or the European Central Bank, have a substantial impact on monetary policies and global financial stability. They regulate interest rates, control the money supply, and influence economic conditions. 5. Media organizations: Media outlets and conglomerates shape public opinion, influence political narratives, and provide information and entertainment on a global scale. Media organizations have the power to set agendas and shape public discourse. 6. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs): NGOs play a crucial role in advocating for social and environmental causes, providing humanitarian aid, and influencing policy and public opinion. Organizations like Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Médecins Sans Frontières are examples of influential NGOs. It's important to note that the influence and power of these entities can vary significantly depending on factors such as geopolitical dynamics, economic strength, cultural influence, and the collective actions of individuals and societies. The global landscape is complex, and power is distributed among various actors, making it challenging to pinpoint a single entity that \\"runs\\" the world."},{"instruction":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","output":"2020 answer: HoverboardPuffy comfy coatA Phone A watchA hoodieRoom Decor :D"},{"instruction":"’m moving with my cats from a very stressful home, & they use their cat trees for comfort now.

You cheated on him…you really can't do a “right” thing following cheating someone. I'm not judging you, you didn't say anything annoying or totally self centered, so I'll assume that you're a good person who isn't sure. But since what you did wasn't great, there's not a great way to deal with it. Hopefully you have otherwise been a kind and caring partner, and the cheating is a seperate issue, not an indicator of how little you care in general. You can only do the less damaging thing, and I think it's less damaging at this point not to tell. Keep it to yourself and commit to doing better if you want to stay with them. Some people might say I'm wrong or dishonest or whatever, but here's what I've learned from relationship experience. Cheating on someone is obviously a crappy thing to do…but telling your significant other is just sharing the hurt with them. If you want the relationship to continue, then you're better off moving forward, not dwelling on it or creating extra drama in your relationship with someone you've already hurt. That said, there are a few situations where telling them is probably the better option. If you cheated with someone that's going to tell, or for some reason, someone else already knows who might tell, you think you're likely to pass on an STD to them, or you are pregnant from that encounter, or want to end your relationship anyway, I would say those are fair reasons to tell the person you cheated on first...because they're going to be hurt anyway. But if it's possible for them not to know, it will be less painful. Otherwise, telling them will just hurt them and make them feel inadequate. I can promise you it won't make things better. I've been in your shoes. Ultimately, it comes down to why you cheated and how likely it is to happen again. It's easy to say you love someone and won't do it again, but it's also possible that you won't stop, even if you do love them. I don't know why, but some people just have REALLY poor impulse control, to the point that they will repeat destructive behavior like cheating, even though they know better, want to do better, and truly love and don't want to hurt the person they are with. But it still hurts them. And someone on the outside doesn't understand how this can keep happening. If this is you, seriously consider how much you want to keep hurting this person, and if you're better off breaking up now. Don't let the relationship die a slow painful death while you create drama by repeatedly cheating and letting them find out, a good person doesn't deserve that. If you are inclined to cheat, you're better off in a situation where there isn't an expectation of monogamy…seriously. It just doesn't work for some people. If you truly think this was a drunk fueled, or otherwise misguided, ONE time mistake, and you will NOT do it again, then the best thing for your relationship would have been for him not to know, because it creates a crack that can never be fixed. It hurts them to know, and telling the other party is usually more about sharing your guilt or bad feelings with them to appease yourself, but you earned those feelings…you just have to move though them and learn. Telling your partner just hurts them. I haven't been cheated on personally, to my knowledge, but I can't imagine how hurt and insecure it could make someone feel. There's way more than I can go into here, but that's my opinion based on trial and error, multiple times over the years. If I can pass this on and help someone, I would love to. However, seeing as how you already told him before you asked if you should, I have a feeling that you will probably do what you're gonna do and think about it later. But maybe I'm wrong, I don't know you. Really…just think about the least hurtful thing you can do for everyone, and go with that"},{"instruction":"What does Ferrari mean in Italian?

But afterimages are a result of an image that continues to appear in one's vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased. And this is only because the vision is lacking in reflex. To most shinobi, shisui might create afterimages, but to people with superior reflexes only see a one shisui running around. Minato and tobirama are considered the fastest shinobi in their Era, and this isn't because of teleportation and Ay knows that. When considering speed, reflexes and reaction play an important factor, and chakra control and volume makes it all possible. The body flicker is a D rank jutsu, which involves high speed movement with the help of Chakra. Not suitable for fights due to inability to effectively use it for the lack of reflexes and better reactions, a case similar to Kakashi's chidori, tunnel vision.

Donald Trump has said many things which go against previous American foreign policy, and are in line with Russian foreign policy. There is, obviously, a great deal of uncertainty and debate about why this is the case. It might be unconnected to Russia, and related to the fact that Trump seems to get his news from far right, conspiracy-prone sources of the “George Soros pays Mexican gang members to pretend to be refugees” variety, and they’re hostile to the EU. But it might be unconnected to that as well. It might be the fact that the EU countries, with a press that the government can’t control and politicians who have to worry about elections, can’t flatter him in the way that Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia, North Korea etc. have, but on the contrary have treated him as fairly comical.

While most drivers choose to buy (or finance) a new car, many shoppers swear that leasing a car is the better decision. So which is correct? When does leasing make more sense than buying? And should you consider it? To help you decide whether leasing is a good idea for you, we've rounded up all the benefits and drawbacks of leasing, and we've laid out our opinions about when you should lease and when you should buy. Benefits of Leasing The biggest benefit of [LINKED_TEXT: leasing a car] [URL: https://silverbackautomotive.com/] rather than buying is that you can usually get more car for your money by leasing. A lease involves paying the depreciation on the car rather than the entire purchase price. For example, if you lease a 20,000 car for 3 years and its projected value at the end of those 3 years is 12,000, then you only make lease payments on the 8,000 difference. If you had bought the car, you'd be making payments on the entire 20,000. Leasing also benefits drivers who don't have much money saved up for a down payment. Many lease deals are available with nothing down or 1,000 down, whereas smart shoppers who finance usually put down 10 to 20 percent of a car's purchase price. There's also the obvious benefit of leasing: You get a new car every few years. If you sign a 5-year loan to purchase a car, you'll be making payments for the next five years, and if you want out, you'll have to sell the car yourself, which can take time, or trade it in for a new model, which can be expensive. If you're leasing a car, your obligation is released as soon as the lease is over, which usually happens every 2 or 3 years, and you'll be free to go get a new model. Drawbacks of Leasing The biggest drawback of leasing is that you aren't building up any equity in your vehicle. Think of it like buying a home: With every mortgage payment, you own a little more of your home. But if you rent your home, just like if you lease a car, your money isn't increasing your ownership stake. As a result, when someone has finished making payments on a leased car, he or she will have to buy or lease another car. When someone has finished making payments on a financed car, he or she owns the vehicle outright with no further payments. Another drawback to leasing is that many leases often come with a mileage restriction. In order to get many good lease deals that are offered by automakers, you'll need to agree to keep your miles low -- usually around 10,000 or 12,000 per year. If you can't do that, the lease rate will go up, or you'll be stuck paying expensive mileage penalties at the end of your lease. Drivers who lease will also have to take very good care of their leased cars. Automakers assume that leased cars will be returned in roughly \\"new-car\\" condition, and they can charge you for excess wear and tear if a leased car is returned with scrapes, bumps and dents."},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

Not some epic breakthrough in productivity but impressive enough - now I can watch an extra Black Mirror episode. But you shouldn’t think of it as a single block of time. Rather, break it down into one-second delays. You’re reading a book, flip a page, and the lights go out for a second. Brave prevented 2,800 of those micro-blackouts. Now, the analogy is a bit of a stretch. After all, there is always some delay when you load a new page. So to state it more accurately, we might say that Brave cut the duration of 5,000 of those black-outs in half. No matter how you parse this out, it becomes clear this is a Big Fucking Deal. During the last 2 weeks, I also opted in to Brave’s ad program. Meaning I volunteer to allow Brave to serve up little, tweet-sized ads. These ads don’t interfere with content, they appear above the browser - no graphics, just text. Brave is clever about not pushing your patience with this. It seems to sense when you’re busy. When I’m typing away like I am now, Brave never serves up an ad. It also will take long stretches of time where it shows no ads at all - so much so I have wondered whether my ads are still on. I opted in for ads because of the other reward Brave offers: a cryptocurrency called BAT (Basic Attention Token). In two weeks I accrued about 5 bucks worth. (Most of it was a random direct gift from Brave, which they do occasionally. But some from ad-watching.) My BAT fortune sits in a wallet I can check any time. I can just hold it. Given historical explosions in value for certain cryptocurrencies, no telling how valuable it might become. But I’ll probably use it to tip content-creators. Small operators on YouTube who don’t have millions of subscribers, but who work hard to cover less popular subjects like astronomy. Or who got demonetized for political reasons. That sort of thing. Brave has enrolled many thousands of content-creators thus far (including some major news outlets), but most small-time creators aren’t signed up yet. (For recent stats see [LINKED_TEXT: Monitoring Brave Browser adoption] [URL: https://batgrowth.com/] ) So I’m going to hold these BAT and hand them out as my favorite channels enroll. I must say, being empowered to directly support media that I love, using money I earned by not looking at embedded ads - merely tolerating unobtrusive, occasional ‘ad-tweets’ - feels pretty good.

To know about these masks, these are respiratory protective masks designed to achieve a very close facial fit. The N95 means that these masks are subjected to block at least 95 percent of very small approx 0.3 microns test particles. If you are wearing these masks properly, then the filtration capabilities can be exceeded to those of face masks. In N95 respirators, edges are designed to form a seal around the nose and mouth. These masks are commonly used in healthcare settings and are a subset of N95 filtering respirators and are referred to as N95. Some Precautions While Using N95 Respirators If you are someone who is suffering from any chronic respiratory, cardiac or other medical conditions then you should check with a health care provider before using it because it can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe. Some models have exhalation valves that can make breathing easier. These respirators are labeled as single-use disposable devices.

Roosevelt \\"forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.\\" But in the post-WW2 years, with the US having 75 percent of the world’s gold reserves, the US did give the Europeans gold in exchange for their dollars. But as European economies and exports strengthened by the 1960s, thedrain on America’s gold reserves became so great, especially by the British, that Nixon had to shut that down.

Whether you’re looking for something lighthearted or serious, there’s something for everyone on Netflix. The Dragon Prince is a Netflix original show that originally premiered in 2018. It tells the story of two young women who are training to be dragon riders—and it may be one of the best shows you've never heard of. The Dragon Prince is based on the book series The Young Riders by Eoin Colfer, and the first season was released on Netflix with lower frame rate animation. Since then, the show has received critical acclaim and has gained a cult following. Season 3 was released on Netflix in late 2019, and it is highly recommended if you're looking for a show to watch. TV series like Black Lightning have been making a big comeback in the past few years. While other superhero series are focused on fighting evil, Black Lightning focuses on the issue of police brutality and the lack of attention given to communities of color.

When they finally went in to check on him he had been masturbating everywhere in the room and everything that came out he wasn't cleaning up so it was just sitting developing an odor of semen and urine mixed.

This was our first trip to Mumbai, a one day journey through train. We somehow reached Mumbai at 9/9:30 and then we started to explore the much talked about sites, the likes of the Taj hotel, Gateway of India, Fashion street, etc.. We were all tired by the end of the day and it was time to leave. We reached CST and even after continuously searching for the train to Pune we didn't find any, at last we boarded the passenger train to Lonavala. We found empty seats to our amusement, we sat or you could say slept on the the empty seats.. Slowly by each passing station the train was being occupied. We realized that it would be filled in the next 1–2 stations and it did. After almost an hour of travel we reached Kalyan station and we all 6 were sitting besides each other and suddenly a middle-aged man requested one of my friends to vacate the place, we didn't find his request to be a request rather it seemed like an order. The next thing my friend does was really not what we expected as he was a studious and a shy guy by nature and rarely did he reciprocate. Fellow passengers watching this joined in with the man and not did they request but actually ordered to vacate the place, as we all were young and could not understand the situation tried to respond in a similar manner and we backed our friend stating we would not vacate the place as we got the seats first. Quickly the whole compartment turned against us and few started to abuse so we had to take a step back and not only did we have to vacate one place but all the six. We didn't understand what had we done but we saw something unusual as all the people occupying the seats got up and vacated the place for the once standing. Later few stations ahead there was a group of men who explained what had happend to us. He stated that it is an unwritten rule in local trains of Mumbai that once the train completes an hour all those who are siting need to vacate their places for the once who are standing as it is more than 2 hours journey till Lonavala and people work for more than 8 hours a day and travel for more than 4 hours a day.

Causing the loop of hate to continue rather than blaming both parties and trying to end it. I will consider myself immoral and an idiot if I generalize Quran-burning practice to the whole of Sweden's population. In Egypt, if a Muslim burns the Christian Bible in public, s/he can get from 1 to 5 years in prison because we know that they are trying to target stupid individuals to riot and cause damage. It also encourages other Islamophobic individuals to feel supported or justified in acting in harmful and unethical ways toward other uninvolved, peaceful Muslims. Funny enough, It also promotes the Quran to be read by unaware people and check Islam. If those individuals are rational enough to distinguish between Islamophobic claims and what Islam really teaches with the support of some real scholarly knowledge, they might understand that some so-called Muslims are acting out of line with what their religion is teaching, and they can use it to their own advantage. Instead of confirming the stereotype and generating more hate, you can use it to shame those individuals into acting in line with Islam. Egyptians do it a lot, and it is a powerful disciplinary tool to use (though it can be misused if the Individuals are talking about false information or false interpretation or if the one taking advice is so arrogant that there is no hope in them). So instead of rioting and causing destruction in the streets, Muslims can go and do a peaceful demonstration with Quran recitation or any other peaceful way because It is haram for us humans to harm an uninvolved party along with the sins of others. “And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.

Leasing is less expensive, it is a fact. With the rising retail and inflation prices of many cars, leasing is often the most flexible financial way to purchase a new vehicle. When leasing a vehicle for the first or fifth time you should expect to put down a very low or minimal down payment along with lower monthly payments compared to outright vehicle financing. A lease is a seamless transition to obtain a new car for less money than you would have to outlay out over the vehicle term life. Leasing enables a lower cost of maintenance opportunity for the lessee. A leases term life almost always ends before the vehicle requires major service or new tires, so maintenance costs remain negligent. Leased vehicles are typically under the original manufacturer protection, so lessee’s do not need to be concerned about the costs of repairs as long as they are problems covered by the warranty. When a purchaser begins to act as a lessee and not a owner, they have the opportunity to receive a new car every 2 to 3 years. Most people admit that they always want to be in the latest car out there to hit the streets. Using a lease as a purchasing mechanism, the lease can offer a quicker time lapse than the standard purchase cycle, which equates to six years. Leases are also easier to be released from. Once the lease term is completed, assuming there are no over-mileage or excessive damage, you can drop off the leased car and move on to whatever is next. This is a lot easier than buying a car with a long loan period, and exhausting the car prior to the loan maturity; especially if you owe more on the car than what it is worth. Last but not least, when you lease a car and you begin to have a lease turnover every 2–3 years you will receive the newest safety vehicle requirements. As we all know, you can not trust other drivers on the road but you can trust the newest safety measures that auto producers develop every year. Having the newest vehicles on the road increases the safety of yourself and the people you drive with everyday."},{"instruction":"As an IITian, what is the best piece of advice you would give to a JEE aspirant?","output":"Hi, The best piece of advise that I can give is , if you have clear vision that you have to get into an IIT, then just believe in yourself and what you study and keep a track on your status throughout your preparation. I’ll tell you my story. I got 93.35 percentile (around 60–65K rank) in JEE Mains January 2020 attempt, then 96.711 percentile (CRL Rank : 36,106) in September 2020 attempt (postponed due to Covid) both the times I was way too far from getting into an IIT. But, I had clear vision that I have to get there anyhow, I believed in myself and my studies and finally qualified JEE Advanced with AIR 9758. Don’t underestimate or overestimate yourself, just have knowledge of your reality that what is your current status of preparation. During the 2 or 4 years of preparation, you will go through ups and downs tons of times. But each time you have to correct yourself and learn. Give ample of tests so that you do the mistakes while practicing, rather than in the final exam. Never feel shy in asking silly doubts to the teachers in coaching, never be afraid of someone laughing at you at times when you ask silly doubts. Be shameless in that. If you have worked enough hard and you deeply know yourself and your capabilities, then just do your work persistently and a great result would be waiting for you. All the best !

Find gaps in existing marketplaces (they exist, read my other 'Amazon' answers) and create your brand. Set up your own ecommerce website later.

There is no “after”, unless you mean that available computing power hits a peak and then begins to decline. Viewing range is always going to cost exponentially more computing power to extend. Imagine being able to stand at the top of a skyscraper in a video game and use a telescope to view photorealistic, continuously updated renderings for miles. Physical detail is a similar problem, imagine being able to examine the brickwork of a wall and make out the shape of each individual brick sticking out of the mortar and detect every subtle misalignment in the brickwork, examine the unique grain of every individual brick. Increasing display resolution and the introduction of new display types is merely arithmetic, but don’t discount it. Generating a visual for each eye to produce stereographic imaging may only double the computation load, and the human eye has limits on resolution which we’ll approach eventually. But something can be non-infinite while also being non-trivial. Physics are part of visual realism, and this makes both the distance viewing problem and the detail problem both insanely more difficult to reach total realism. Realistic atmospheric effects rather than painted skyboxes, realistic effects when you hammer a brick to break off a corner and expose some of the interior, realistic collision dynamics when you drop the brick on the ground and bits of it knock off but there is still partial elasticity because the whole brick doesn’t break…then extend that to everything in the game. Eventually, computers will get so powerful that one can simulate reality so perfect that your natural eyes and brain would never be able to tell the difference…but by then people will be using computers to extend their mental capabilities significantly. So the bar for a completely realistic simulation just keeps getting raised. Until you hit some absolute limit on how powerful computers can be in principle. Which would probably be the universe collapsing or burning out or whatever. Again, there is no “after”."},{"instruction":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","output":"There are a variety of factors that can contribute to depression in this generation.

Additionally, mental health issues can be exacerbated by the current political climate, economic instability, and increased exposure to traumatic events through news and social media. TO SUPPORT FOLLOW ME!"},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","output":"First of all, let me clarify that the currency value of a country doesn't necessarily mean the strength of that economy. If that were to be the case, then the Bangladeshi economy would've been stronger than the Japaneseeconomy as 1 Bangladeshi Taka is equal to 1.4 Japanese Yen. Now let's envision what would have happened if 1 rupee equals to 1 dollar, w.r.t. the India, Pros of the situation:1) First of all buying goods will be cheaper as the price of imports will be cheaper.2)Buying luxury goods will also be cheaper - you can easily buy an I-Phone 7 for Rs.542!3) As imports would be cheaper, this would reduce the price of petrol and diesel, leading to low transportation costs. Cons of the situation:But on the other side of the coin, the story is totally different.1) Exports will fall, as they'll become expensive and why would any country buy our products if they can get it through other countries at a cheaper rate.2) There will also be a decrease in foreign investment as investing in our country will become expensive as compared to other countries. One of the main reasons why foreign countries invest in India is because of the cheap price.3) Also, the unemployment rate will go up, as few would hire an Indian at Rs.75,000 if they can get an outsider at 3000.4) Many companies will move out of India as their expenses will be high, and their businesses non-profitable.5) Even your maid, with a salary of, say Rs.4,000 can buy seven I-Phone 7! This can be clearly seen that if 1 rupee would've been equal to 1 dollar, there would've been a high unemployment rate and a slower economic growth, because of lesser foreign investment. Thus, the situation of a rupee being equal to a dollar is not affordable for a growing and a developing economy like India. A similar situation occurred in 2007-08 when 1 dollar was equal to about Rs 41. At that time, imports of the country was good, but the exports and the IT sector got affected a lot. INR vs. US in 2011-12Source: Google Now you will say what if we buy swadeshi (domestic) products only and boycott foreign goods.This situation would also not work, as it was a regular practice till 1990 when we used to use our own products. Since then, however, our economy has grown manifold, and if we boycott the goods of other nations, they may also boycott Indian goods! Another developing nation, China, has adopted the fixed exchange rate system, in which they decide the value of their currency with respect to the U.S. dollar, and whenever they want to increase their exports, they just depreciate the value of their currency (Yuan). The value of the INR from 1 in 1947 to 61 in 2014 to over 65 today! (w.r.t. the US) The falling value of the rupee (up to a certain extent) doesn't worry our Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor. They are more worried about the fluctuations of the rupee. If the value of the rupee yesterday was 60 and 70 today, there is too much fluctuations in the currency, which will have an adverse effect on the stability of the Indian economy. India has adopted the floating exchange rate system (since 1975). In the floating system, the value of the currency can't be determined by the RBI Governor, the Finance Minister or the government, it is determined by the currency demand & supply that prevails in the market. But still, the Finance Minister has some control over policy and foreign reserves, through which he tries to maintain a constant value of the rupee, by controlling the inflation rate, and in the process, prevents the currency from getting completely destroyed. Now lets come to reality, today 1 dollar is more than 65 rupees. As Indians, we do want our currency to be at a higher rate but at what cost? The cost of it, at this point in time, is too high (higher unemployment, lower economic growth and lower foreign investment). We can challenge the dollar later but first let our economy grow and don't forget what I mentioned above- cost of currency does not necessarily signify the strength of an economy."},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

The official reason is because of delays putting the entire project at risk - before the war even started. The war adds to the risks to a timeline that is already suffering. In addition to these legitimate and non-political reasons for dropping the Russian nuclear alternative, the Finns were looking for a way to get the Russians out of the project. There were threats to the construction permits (which may or may not have been grounded in law) and significant public and political pressure to keep the Russians out of critical infrastructure projects. “Fennovoima’s board saw no other option than to terminate the contract,” Chairman Esa Harmala said at a press conference. “This decision was not taken because of the war” but “because of delays and an inability to deliver, and we have seen the war added to these risks.” [LINKED_TEXT: Finland Drops Nuclear Plant Deal With Russian Energy Company (2)] [URL: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-02/finland-s-fennovoima-terminates-rosatom-nuclear-plant-contract-l2oe3k2j] Thanks for the A2A."},{"instruction":"Do your cats ‘help’ you with household chores?","output":"No. They skedaddle whenever they see me pick up a broom or mop or get out the vacuum cleaner.

If somebody gave me 118 million, I wouldn't sneer and say, That's not enough.","output":"393 million is the total box-office So the total price of movies tickets sold for the movie. The problem is that when you pay 8 for a Disney movie ticket, Disney don’t get 8. There is a part of this money that goes to the movie-theater. And there is also taxes. On average the studio get 50% of the ticket sales money (but it deeply depends of the country, and of the studio). Movie-theaters are not free. You need to rent a place, to buy projectors, to heat the theaters in winter and to cool it in summer, to pay cashiers, projectionists and security. So, 393 million of tickets sales worldwide means something like 200 million for Disney (at most). And 275 million is the budget for producing the movie.

Indeed, this was one of the things that drove the conservative Tea Party movement. Overall conservatives in the US are somewhat unified in the notion of every man for himself and low taxes for everyone. It is on that basis that they oppose student loan relief. What I think you are referring to, though, is that corporate lobbying tends to be slightly more effective (and I do mean slightly) toward GOP representatives than Democratic representatives. This is a result of the fact that GOP voters have a tendency to vote more on the basis of individual social issues, then a candidate's record overall. So a GOP voter will often vote for a candidate based on their anti-abortion stance and ignore their relationships with big business. Democratic voters have a tendency to vote on a wider range of issues. P.S. In recent times, the GOP has become an odd amalgamation of social conservatives, modestly educated voters, and the wealthy.

People munching the food(pizza/popcorn/nachos)etc right next to me isn’t always a pleasant experience. Had 4–5 people who purchased their seats and tried to buy one more later for one more person. Looks like I have found the one and only seat in the last row and I have purchased it. They have assumed to take my seat by coming early and thinking that the person will take corner seat.

He basically went from satrapy to another and replaced the satraps, in some cases he even left the same satrap in power and just made them swear allegiance to him. Aside from that he mostly left the old Persian system of autonomy in place. He didn't drastically change the laws, administration, taxation, bureaucracy etc. So his empire mostly hummed along as before just with new management. The big changes that did occur occurred after his death, when his generals divided the empire up between themselves and so had to develop some new institutions. The most drastic being in Egypt, where the Ptolemies actively integrated themselves into the Egyptian political and religious system while also creating new Greco-Egyptian gods like Serapis. Outside of Egypt though the most lasting aspect of the Hellenistic period was mostly artistic. From modern India to modern Turkey you can see examples of Hellenistic influence on the local cultures, like these busts of Alexander the Great and Buddha respectively: Names also left some influence, Iskander, a Persianised form of Alexander, is a common name in the Middle East and South Asia today, and there are still a few “Iskandaryias\\" around Asia. There was also some residual influence on Jewish culture. The story of Gog and Magog from the Bible talks about how Alexander the Great built a gate in the Caucasus to keep out the demons of the Steppe (ie. Scythians and Turkic horse nomads). But apart from that the Hellenistic influence on the East wasn't all that strong."},{"instruction":"Why was the British Empire able to become so big/powerful when the UK is so small? What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","output":"Discipline and order must be at the very top of the list and highlighted in bold. Other imperial powers existed and many had advantages over the British but they all ultimately fell short due to a lack of order and discipline. The Spanish, Portuguese, French and to a lesser extent the Dutch all came up short because man for man they couldn't match the British system. It doesn't matter that they built bigger and better ships when we had better sailors. It doesn't matter that they built better and bigger cannon when we had better gunners. It doesn't matter that they built bigger and better crossbows when we had better archers. The list goes on and on. The Spanish might run. The French might fight each other. The Dutch might discuss the situation at length. The British will stand and fight to the last man. I can almost guarantee you with all that I own that were Agincourt to be fought with the odds the other way around neither the Spanish, Portugese or French would have fought that day. They would have retreated, surrendered or paid a tribune. The same might also be said of Trafalgar. I don't believe the British were naturally reckless or audacious. They simply understood what needed to be done, what it involved and that it was their duty to get it done. Whilst the others were complaining and wailing at their commanding officers about the task they had been set the British had already accepted their fate and begun their preparations. I can imagine the pep talk often went along the lines of ‘Lads, It's France’ or ‘Lads, It's Spain’ and that's about all that needed to be said. Whether real or imagined the perception has often been that those nations lacked any real grit and would roll over once it hit the fan. That sort of supriority complex also provided a tremendous mental fortitude that success or death were the only valid options. I'm not sure the French or Spanish ever really thought they would defeat the British on any given day in the same way. You put all that together and order, discipline and mental fortitude really stand out."},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"I guess it depends on what you mean, or are asking, by “horrible”. My very first admission I witnessed a male patient put a table through the beverage bay window, after a misunderstanding between him and a bank nurse escalated (the nurse was the one who made it far worse and thought that pushing this guy into the beverage bay and closing the door would somehow help…), which was scary and traumatic for me. I’ve had several incidences of being attacked physically and verbally by other patients, and witnessed patients verbally and/or physically attack other patients and staff. Definitely not pleasant experiences. I’ve been kept in the common area with other patients while machine after machine were run down the corridor to try and revive an older patient who had collapsed - this was horrible to witness on many levels. I’ve witnessed patients running around naked or semi-naked and urinating in inappropriate places. I’m lucky that I have never been on a ward where patients were abused by staff, as these places do exist and I’m sure that is horrible to witness and/or experience. The above is all I can think of at this point, they meet my definition of “horrible” but I’m not sure if they answer your question."},{"instruction":"Did Dracula turn any male people into vampires?","output":"No. In the book and the movie he never turns men into vampires. Why? Well, he's a man that can have all the beautiful women he wants, so why share it with other male vampires. In Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles, her vampires can't have sex. So it isn't that relevant who they turn. Also her vampires (most of them) seem to be bisexual. Although they can't have sex. Which is kinda funny enough. Seeing that by all accounts it should've been Stephenie Meyer vampires that shouldn't be able to have sex, less alone reproduce with normal human women.

The funds in public schools come from property taxes which depends on the status of property in the area. Nedless to say a well-to-do neighborhood will have a school well funded while a poor neighborhood, will be pooerly funded. This results in some schools being “good” and some “bad” in the sense of their maintaince and education quality. As the achievements of these schools is dependent upon the common tests like SATs that check the quality of education imparted in the schools, the poor neighborhoods here too experiences a backlash. As a capitalist system, the US has had the system of 'redlining' neighbourhoods worthy of development and investment and often ignored the already poor communities. Therefore the problem in the education system is a system of class and capitalism.

It is mostly being used for accessibility, security, and privacy depending on your needs. One example is an HTTP proxy that allows you to browse websites anonymously. It hides your own IP address and connects using their own IP. It is also being used to access certain websites or applications with restrictions such as sites that can only be accessed on a specific location. Basically, it works when a client sends the request to the proxy, the proxy will then forward this request to the server. The server will send it back to the proxy and proxy to the client. There is no direct connection between the client and the server.

While they share some similarities, there are significant differences between them that make each unique. In this article, we will explore the differences between granite and marble, including their properties, uses, and care requirements. Properties [LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://rynestone.in/collections/granite-manufacturers-and-suppliers-in-india] is an igneous rock formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. It is composed of several minerals, including quartz, feldspar, and mica. Granite is known for its durability, strength, and resistance to heat, scratches, and stains. It is available in a wide range of colors and patterns, making it a versatile choice for kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, and flooring. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock formed from the recrystallization of limestone or dolomite. It is composed mainly of calcium carbonate and is known for its unique veining and elegant appearance. While marble is softer and more porous than granite, it can still be used in a variety of applications, such as countertops, flooring, and decorative accents. Uses Granite is a popular choice for kitchen countertops due to its durability, heat resistance, and low maintenance requirements. It is also commonly used for outdoor applications, such as paving stones, pool coping, and fire pits. In addition, granite is a popular choice for bathroom vanities, flooring, and backsplashes. Marble is commonly used for bathroom vanities, fireplace surrounds, and decorative accents such as tabletops and sculptures. Its unique veining and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for high-end homes and commercial buildings. However, due to its softer and more porous nature, it is not recommended for high-traffic areas such as kitchen countertops or outdoor applications. Care requirements Granite is relatively low maintenance and easy to care for. It should be sealed regularly to protect against stains and bacteria, and spills should be wiped up immediately to prevent damage to the surface. Granite can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution or a granite-specific cleaner. Marble, on the other hand, requires more care and attention. It is more susceptible to scratches, etches, and stains, and should be sealed regularly to protect against damage. Spills should be wiped up immediately, and acidic substances such as vinegar and lemon juice should be avoided. Marble can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution or a marble-specific cleaner. Conclusion In summary, granite and marble are two popular natural stones used in home decor and construction. While they share some similarities, such as their natural beauty and versatility, they differ significantly in their properties, uses, and care requirements. By understanding these differences, you can make an informed decision when choosing between granite and marble for your next project."},{"instruction":"f a base is stronger than the hydroxide ion, then is it a superbase?","output":"There can not be any stronger bases in a medium than the proton-accepting form of the medium molecule.

So when you send requests to the internet, they pass through the proxy server and the server handles the requests and also received them for you. This way, your real identity is not exposed, and your activity remains private. How does a proxy server work? By acting as an intermediary between your device and the internet, proxies shunt your direct connection to the web and can enhance your privacy, bypass content filters, and geo-blocked content, among others. A proxy does this and a lot more by sending all requests through the proxy server and process it before forwarding to the web and sending the result back to you. So instead of your computer or phone having direct communication with the server and sending its request, the request is first processed through the proxy’s server before being sent to the target server. This way, you can stay protected as the target server doesn’t see you as the visitor but the visiting proxy IP. So if you are concerned about the information websites to have on you, and want to keep your online activities private, making use of a proxy is a huge step to go about it. Note that not all proxies have equal capacities; the level of privacy and anonymity one would give you may be different from that from another proxy.

Coming to your question, hacking and cyber forensics are 2 different faces of the same coin, yet both of these are different. Cyber forensics is more related to finding who did the particular act if hacking or an internet based crime,whereas hacking is the case when u do the actual work for one or the other causes. This I would like to explain to you as… Consider a scenario, where you have to get the files related to some small quiz, so here when u get the quiz files from the system which is initially holding it… this would be coming under the part of a hacker and here the hacker can be both a white hat hacker or a black hat one, this really would not make a difference. In the same scenario when some detective or a person looks at the system from which the quiz file was taken and tries to figure out who that was or how the data was taken, this would be under the job role of cyber forensics.

In summary, Dil Bechara is anywhere from an okay to good movie that acquires a whole new meaning in its final 20 minutes, dishing out moments that elevate its surreal nature by blurring the lines between fiction and reality. Directed by debutante Mukesh Chhabra, Dil Bechara plays off like a faithful adaptation of John Green’s The Fault In Our Stars, albeit commercializing, or rather Bollywoodizing a few of the novel’s plot points. The character names are Indian and swapped (the girl’s name is two words while the male’s name is three), the lead female’s obsession with an incomplete book changes to one with an unfinished song, the Bollywood hero’s side-kick friend gets typically sidelined and the search for an author is replaced by the search for a musician, both played by big names in their respective film industries. But where The Fault In Our Stars evoked strong emotions nearly throughout, Dil Bechara resorts to cliches and tropes to tide its narrative forward and as a consequence, appears a bit corny at times. Immanuel Rajkumar Junior a.k.a. Manny is our conventional-unconventional, eccentric, larger than life Bollywood hero who believes in living life on the edge, wooing the girl and smiling despite losing his leg to osteosarcoma in a clever conceit that allows Manny to have an illness while saving on VFX budget. Kizie Basu becomes the familiar female lead who battles her cancer cynically at first before she starts enjoying life a bit and warming up to Manny who opens her minds to new perspectives while infecting her with his contagious happy-go-lucky demeanor. Narratively, Dil Bechara comes across as a series of events strung together without much momentum from one to the next. Editing flaws are glaringly visible resulting in some sequences feeling cut short or some arriving out of nowhere (the opening title track and the Paris scenes for instance). A theory doing the rounds is that much of the film was cut resulting in its 1 hour 40 minute run time (brief by Bollywood standards). An extended sequence in Paris sees our leads meet the supposedly charming Abhimanyu Veer only to realize he’s a dickish, snobbish musician who has no definite answers for them. The entire sequence is directed bizarrely with jarring camera angles, off music and an almost unfinished vibe that makes it stick out far more than Saif Ali Khan’s irritating performance. This completely robs the scene of its importance in the story; where it becomes a defining moment for Hazel Grace Lancaster, it just becomes another development that is brushed aside. This isn’t to say the movie doesn’t have any redeeming qualities. A. R. Rahman’s album is breezy and I found the songs endearing, smooth flowing and adding to the film’s romantic and dreamy qualities. It features a strong supporting cast with special kudos to Swastika Mukherjee as Kizie’s mom who portrays a fairly typical, concerned Bengali mother with aplomb, giving her all. Her husband played by Saswata Chatterjee is equally competent yet underutilized, as is evident in his brief outburst over her wife and a memorable scene with Sushant. Another underused actor is Sahil Vaid who shifts his performance gradually as his character goes blind but stands strong by Sushant’s side. The film rests on its two leads, of which Sanjana Sanghi does a fairly okay job, seeing as its her first film. She lacks the experience to bring out some really euphoric emotions at times (watch her tepid reaction to receiving an email response from Veer) but carries both the burden of the oxygen cylinder and her film drudgingly with her. Ultimately, it is Sushant Singh Rajput as Manny who injects a healthy dose of vibrancy to the film, doing his best to bring the director’s vision of a half-baked larger-than-life person to life. As Manny Sushant tries to create a character with his own quirks, shifts his walking mannerism due to an artificial lib and is woefully persistent in wooing Kizie, sometimes to the point of irritation, exuding an annoyance so reminiscent of the 90s heroes. That approach is certainly outdated in today’s times but Sushant fully embraces the character’s high-spirited nature and tries hard to make it work, even delivering a dance number shot in a single, continuous take. And if this were a normal movie, the review would end here. In the weeks leading up to it, we’ve all been following the news and we all know what transpired. Rajput apparently succumbed to suicide (I say apparently because the case is still being investigated). Instead of this being swept under the rug, it ignited a massive wave of conversation over nepotism, character smudging by PR blinds and the film industry’s elite connected in a way that makes any outsider truly breaking through impossible. As things stand, the actor’s demise affects the way profoundly. As much as I hate to admit it, the film acquires a whole new meaning in its final 20 minutes with the revelation that Rajput’s character’s cancer has returned and is now terminal in its final stages. Yep, that’s a spoiler but for a film that’s been seen by 95 million people in its Hotstar premiere, I’ll take that chance. In an almost surreal case of life imitating art, the realization sinks in: we’re watching what would be the final moments of Sushant’s life as an actor, the last new footage that exists of him - in character or otherwise. As Manny passes away, so too will we never see Sushant again. The news of Sushant’s death was so sudden that many couldn’t fully grasp or absorb the impact of it. These moments give you an alternate, if ficitious window into watching the final visuals of an actor now gone. That realization really hits hard, making this section of Dil Bechara quite painful to watch. It’s only exacerbated by the fact that Sushant portrayed Manny as an endearing (if annoying at times) personality and this, coupled with the actor’s real-life demise, latches into our heads as scenes start playing out showing him struggling to come to terms with accepting his fate. The lines start blurring. Did Sushant go through similar struggles of existential crisis in the final few moments? Did he feel as broken down? In those final moments, it does feel like Sushant is talking through the camera to us, revealing his most vulnerable self in plain sight. A scene between him and Kizie’s father is particularly poignant in this regard. Sushant explains how the cancer not just took away his legs but his soul. How his losses and wins won’t matter, how he’d be looked at affectionately because of his “condition” and how that robs him of a shot at fair play at life. And in an almost meta sort of way, the final sequence has the characters gather in a drive-by theater to watch a B-grade film that Kizie and Manny adoringly shot over the course of their time spent together. The characters watching Manny’s posthumous film realizing this is the final footage of Manny they’ll ever see mirrors us watching Dil Bechara with that very same realization. If that realization skips by you, great. If it hits you, it’ll hit you like a brick and you’ll likely find yourself bawling with tears. All of this leaves me with one fleeting, controversial thought. We all know the kind of intelligence that Sushant carried. What if, in his life’s final moments, he somehow imagined that Dil Bechara would resonate hard with fans after he’s gone? That his death would immortalize his character? That it would add a whole new dimension to what would otherwise be slammed as a run-of-the-mill Bollywood film?

Am I missing something very obvious?","output":"There's nothing to miss. Littlefinger got absolutely nothing for giving Sansa to the Boltons. He actually expected to get the loyalty of Sansa and the North by selling her to the North's biggest traitors. The prospect of Sansa being raped by Ramsay was too much for D&D to pass up so they had LF sell her to the Boltons for… reasons. I've seen that people have said LF did it so Cersei would name him Warden of the North once he brought the KotV to defeat the Boltons but they almost always leave out the most important part of that conversation. Cersei would only name him Warden if he killed Sansa and brought her Sansa's head. He was never going to be named Warden by Cersei so that being used as a reason for him doing it has never made any sense. It has never been explained because there is no explanation and D&D knew it. Sansa said how could he protect her as he stated by selling her to Boltons. LF asked to speak to her alone so he could explain everything but that was never going to happen which is why D&D felt comfortable with him asking. It's similar to that stupid “light the candle” plan that Brienne had with Sansa as a signal to rescue her which was never going to happen because they knew she would turn away to go and kill Stannis. There's a pattern to dumbass plans made by characters as written by D&D. They don't usually have the characters explain why they made those dumbass plans or get interrupted before they can be carried out."},{"instruction":"What did the Jedi do if they found a teenager or adult that was strong in the force but was missed as a baby?

TM is often associated with the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who introduced the technique to the western world in the 1950s. While TM does charge for instruction, it is not solely focused on making money. The fees charged by TM are used to cover the costs of training and supporting teachers, as well as funding research and outreach programs. TM has been the subject of numerous scientific studies, and there is evidence to suggest that it may have various benefits for mental and physical health, including reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, improving focus and concentration, and lowering blood pressure. While some critics argue that the fees charged by TM are too high, proponents argue that the benefits of the practice justify the cost. Ultimately, the decision to pursue TM or any other form of meditation is a personal one, and individuals should carefully consider the costs and benefits before deciding to invest in instruction."},{"instruction":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","output":"I would say black pudding."},{"instruction":"What is ताजमहल किस नदी के किनारे स्थित हैं?","output":"यमुना नदी।"},{"instruction":"Why are modern Iranians lighter than ancient Iranians, when both are Persians?","output":"I’m no genetics expert. But from what I’ve gathered, it seems light skin, light hair, and light eyes are all genetically rescesive traits that proliferated among some human groups outside of Africa around 8000 years ago due to sexual selection( a preference for partners exhibiting these genetic features).

Probably to do with the fact that all humans ancestry, including that of Indo-Iranians derived from Africa. So it’s a logical deduction that the further and further in the past you look, the more this would be apparent. Even after tens of thousands of years after leaving Africa, humans still had darkskin, and in some cases light eyes. (Fact: The popularity of light skin among humans has steadily increased since 6000 B.C, and human beings are still getting lighter to this day thanks to sexual selection.) Diverse range of skin types in Ancient West Asia: Some people will call this observation, ‘Afrocentric’ but it’s got nothing to do with modern politics. It’s simply the truth of the matter. No matter how we flip the coin, the outcome is that modern human being is a uniquely African phenomena. And this is proven by the extremely diverse and ancient DNA among modern day Africans. So it’s important to consider that, though it’s rare, these traits can manifest among African populations.

How it pleaded with me the advantages Agastya ( which is his name) would have on eating it, the health benefits it would cause him so on and so forth.

One day he refused to relent, then my son (Agastya is my daughter's son) drew this picture on the board and asked him to tick the correct one.

Given the massive energy release of a nuclear device, even a very small “rocket” with a nuclear detonation in the chamber would have to be several hundred meters in radius, a rather impractical approach, so the developers of ORION looked at external propulsion; detonating a nuclear device coated in some material which would be “flung” at the spacecraft at high velocity, transferring momentum to the spacecraft and propelling it. This was obviously very inefficient, so the idea underwent continual refinement, with the final versions using a highly engineered “pulse unit” to transmit the energy of the nuclear device to to spacecraft. Orion nuclear pulse unit The nuclear explosion releases most of its energy in the form of a spherical wave of X ray radiation. The “Radiation case” is built out of an x-ray opaque material (in this case U-238) with a single aperture for the X ray radiation to flow out of in the microseconds before the pulse unit is vapourized. The radiation heats material in the channel filler, which in turn heats a propellant material (in this case Tungsten) to plasma temperatures and fires it at the spacecraft. The spaceship intercepts the plasma with a “pusher plate” and the momentum is transferred to the spacecraft via a series of shock absorbers. Classic ORION spacecraft ORION is still the only system known which combines both high thrust and high ISP. However, the idea of launching multi thousand ton spacecraft from Earth using a stream of nuclear explosions created some…..concern…. and the nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 effectively killed ORION in that form. However, the lure of high thrust, high ISP drive continues to attract attention, and while the classic idea of an ORION spacecraft blasting off from Jackass flats on a pillar of nuclear fire is no longer under consideration, alternatives have been sought. Some ideas, like “[LINKED_TEXT: Mini Mag] [URL: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#minimagorion]” ORION seek to reduce the amount fo nuclear fuel needed by using exotic techniques to crush sub critical masses of fission fuel to release energy and capturing it in a magnetic field rather than a physical pusher plate. Many nuclear fusion proposals incorporate [LINKED_TEXT: Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)] [URL: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#icfusion] fusion, triggering tiny fusion explosions at a high rate at the focus of a magnetic nozzle using lasers or ion beams. The main issue here is no one has yet succeeded in demonstrating ICF, much less at high repetition rates. Dedalus, a conceptual ICF rocket An interesting aside was the British Interplanetary Society study called “[LINKED_TEXT: Medusa] [URL: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#medusa]”, which turned the concept around and had a “tractor” configuration with a huge “parachute” or sail to capture the momentum of the nuclear plasma. Given sufficient distance, this would be far more efficient than the classic ORION, being able to capture far more energy with a much lighter structure. The overall mass of the spacecraft would also be far less since the need for massive pusher plates and shock absorbers would have been eliminated as well. Since space is already a high radiation environment, the crew capsule would be protected from the additional radiation of the exploding nuclear devices, and have additional protection from being tens to hundreds of kilometres behind the sail.

And even in some fantasyland where socialists run Congress, I suspect that such legislation would meet with resistance from the Supreme Court. Here’s a quick test for your relative: Ask them to explain what “seizing the means of production” entails, ask them what they think about the case law around the commerce clause and due process, and ask them about the limits of executive power and the things that can only be accomplished via the legislature. If your relative cannot respond cogently to these questions, you can safely disregard anything they have to say about the imminent doom of socialism in the United States. Oh, and you could point to the ample evidence that Clinton is a bit of a neoliberal — but then your relative would have to have some sense of what “neoliberal” means.

In this answer, I’m breaking down the domain transfer process so you know exactly what it entails — no surprises. (SPOILER: It’s straightforward. Sure, it takes a few steps, but it’s not complicated.) Full disclosure: Domain names are my bread & butter.

Let’s explore the domain name transfer process. Why transfer a domain name? There could be many reasons, but the two listed below are the most common. Change of ownership.Whether you're selling your domain name or purchased it under the wrong account, sometimes domains change ownership. Change of registrar.Not receiving the services and support you deserve with your current registrar? That's a significant motivating factor when transferring domain names. What does it mean to transfer a domain name? Simple: [LINKED_TEXT: Transferring a domain name] [URL: https://www.domain.com/domains/transfer/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=quora] means moving a domain from one registrar to another. How long does it take to transfer a domain name? The process of transferring a domain name is quick — if you have everything prepared, then your portion of the process should only take a couple of hours, max. Your registrar must finalize the transfer process, and typically, that should take no longer than 5-7 business days. How much does it cost to transfer a domain name? ICANN, the organization that oversees domains, requires that a one-year extension be added to domains when they're transferred to a new registrar. Some registrars charge an additional fee on top of the standard one-year extension (renewal) fee. However, some registrars don’t. At Domain.com, domain transfers are free. That means no fees in addition to the required 1-year renewal charge. What do I need to transfer my domain name? The [LINKED_TEXT: process of transferring a domain name] [URL: https://www.domain.com/help/article/domain-transfer-how-to-transfer-a-domain-to-your-account?utm_source=social&utm_medium=quora] is largely the same across most registrars. To transfer a domain name, you need to ensure the following four things. Your domain name must be valid and registered with a different registrar.Your domain name must be registered for at least 60 days and unlocked.Your Admin contact information must be up-to-date.You've obtained your transfer authorization code (also known as an EPP code).

Some registrars insist on this for security purposes.Your domain must be registered for at least 60 days.In the domain industry, it's standard practice to lock a domain for 60 days post-registration. During this time, no changes can be made to the domain name. (That includes updates to registration information and transferring the domain.) You can manually opt-out of the 60-day lock from your domain admin panel if you plan to transfer your domain immediately post-registration. Once a domain name transfer starts, you cannot update your nameservers, change WHOIS registration information, or renew the domain. To make any of these changes, you must wait for the transfer to complete or contact your registrar to cancel the transfer. Why transfer my domain name to Domain.com?

Dofollow backlinks are links that search engines will follow when crawling a webpage, and therefore they pass link equity or \\"link juice\\" from the linking webpage to the linked webpage. In other words, dofollow backlinks can positively impact the linked webpage's search engine rankings. On the other hand, nofollow backlinks are links that are designed to tell search engines not to follow or pass any link equity to the linked webpage. They are created by adding a rel=\\"nofollow\\" attribute to the link. Nofollow links do not have any impact on the linked webpage's search engine rankings. In general, dofollow backlinks are more valuable for improving search engine rankings, but it's important to have a mix of both dofollow and nofollow backlinks in your link profile for a more natural-looking backlink profile.

I can’t easily find anything on line describing this particular theory, other than a self-reflection back to Quora, that led to a “dubious” web site reference. Having said that what I read from Quora reference seems to be reasonable. Perhaps I can simplify what the problem is. No one is doubting the “consequences” of cosmic inflation.The problem is in three parts.The details of that “inflation” - basically how the universe is inflating, and why it did not collapse back on itself because of gravity.What would be the end result of that inflation? Would the universe later on collapse back on itself in a Big Crunch? Would it continue to expand? Or would it gradually just reduce its rate of expansion?And “what happened” just BEFORE inflation but AFTER the singularity? It is this problem that is the most “open ended”.Because of the nature of “singularities” and questions about “existence”, there are many possible variations on the basic theory like this. The truth is that both “big bang” and “big whisper” have semantic connotations that are not helpful in any way to “understanding”. We can even see this in the alternative set of theories, called “steady state”. So far we do not have any evidence at all that we can account for cosmic inflation with “microbangs”making the original “debunked” theory of Hoyle into a still valid “modified steady state” theory. And to be honest, whenever physicists start talking too much about “dark matter” that can’t be observed or “cosmological constants” to explain something e.g. inflation, we can see they are getting desperate for “elegance” in their theory. As far as I can see, it is still basically the same theory. The universe is still “begining” as looking like it is very hot and very dense.

Location, Location, Location Location can make or break your first date. Unless you have a particular activity in mind, Chantelle recommends choosing somewhere that is relaxed and not too niche. “An extravagant dinner date to kick things off can be a little intense for some, but a walk by the beach or a casual meal at the pub can ensure you’re able to get to know the person and a casual setting. Think of a location that can fuel connection, intimacy and drive conversation and always remember to choose locations that make you feel safe and comfortable,” she said. Other places to try include a bar or a coffee shop, as they can have a nice vibe and are the perfect places to have long, uninterrupted conversations. It’s best to avoid fancy restaurants and super-romantic locations on your first date, as it can make it feel high-pressure or like you’re already on your 67th date! A bar of a coffee shop also makes it easy to leave after one drink if you’re not feeling it. Or, if you’re hitting it off, you have the option to stay for a few more drinks. 2. Get Your Mind Right Getting your head in the right place before your first date can be the hardest part. You need to approach the date confidently, but ensure you’re not acting too cocky. The best way to approach the first date mentally is by treating it as you would meeting any person for the first time, but getting your mind right can be harder still. Luckily, Chantelle has a few tips to help get the edge off. “If you are dipping your toe back into the dating game, it can be super nerve-wracking to get on a dating app and even more so, to organise a meeting up in in-person. If you feel like this, you’re not alone, Bumble actually did some research on this at the end of last year – they called it the rise of the cautious dater, and it’s not surprising that many Aussies feel a sense of anxiety about dating, particularly post-pandemic,” she said. “The best way to get in the right mindset before a date is to make time for you in the lead-up. Make a pre-date playlist, take your time getting ready – wearing something that makes you feel amazing will arm you with the right energy for your date. If you are still feeling nervous – fake it until you make it! Chances are, your date is feeling the same way.” Meeting new people is exciting and nothing to be nervous about. If you get along, great. If not, well, at least you got to meet someone new and had some interesting conversations. 3. Learn, But Don’t Reminisce Learning about someone involves sharing stories and delving into the past. Keeping this in mind, one of the best first date tips is to avoid reminiscing about the past while on your first date, especially if previous relationships are part of the stories! That being said, it’s always great to learn from the past, but does practice make perfect? Yes. “It is always good to learn from your past dates – I am a big fan of practice makes perfect, in every aspect of the dating experience. If you find yourself on a date that is going less than perfectly – it doesn’t matter! If anything, when it’s all over you’ll have a great story to tell your friends. The more you allow yourself to step outside of your comfort zone, the more prepared you’ll feel for your next date,” said Otten. “It’s also important to remember that rejection sucks and it’s painful but it can happen. Look at it as an opportunity rather than a setback. No need to waste your time on people who don’t like you as much as you like them or vice versa. Keep moving baby.” Share stories from your past but keep them brief and end them with a question, so your date has the opportunity to engage. 4. Give a quick and cool hello. Even if you and your date text all the time, the first moment of a real-life date can be the scariest part— so much buildup! Keep your cool and calm their jitters by giving them a warm hi and a quick hello hug. When they see how cool you're playing it, not only will they be impressed, but they'll also start to calm down too. Another way to diffuse the awkwardness is by making a joke (\\"Full disclosure: I changed three times!\\"). They'll realize you don't take yourself too seriously and once you guys get a good laugh in together, you'll be ready to start the night and have some fun. 5. Keep the convo moving. First dates can sometimes feel like a job interview. Both parties are trying to gain all the info they can on each other, and the back and forth questioning can seem insincere. It's totally normal to want to know everything about the person you're on a date with, but just realize that's going to take some time. Instead of shooting questions at your date, ask them one and then let a conversation build from there. If they love rap music, start discussing that! Don't just move on to the next question on your list."},{"instruction":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","output":"If you are done with the hard drive, drive holes through it multiple times.

Typically, their responsibilities within a research and development project in an IT company include: Defining the project scopeConducting business researchGathering project requirementsCreating requirements specificationsTranslating requirements to the teamPerforming acceptance testing 1. Defining the project scope A business analyst should define the ultimate vision of what the project should look like early on, effectively limiting the scope of development. A precisely defined project scope will help the team prioritize features in order to deliver a minimum viable product as early as possible instead of spending time on secondary and nice-to-have features. 2. Conducting business research In order to determine the scope of the project and gather all necessary requirements, a BA also needs to research information related to the project. This can include: competitor researchdocument analysisbrainstormingprototypingother research methods Elicitation allows an analyst to gain a clear understanding of business needs related to the project, thus facilitating requirements gathering. 3. Gathering project requirements Requirements gathering takes a unique blend of communication skills and technical expertise that simply cannot be found in anyone other than a BA. A BA carefully evaluates the needs of stakeholders based on their objectives and concerns. This is where business analysts apply their facilitation skills. They need to ask the correct questions to find the root cause of the issue and an appropriate solution that will meet everybody’s needs. To do that, the BA has to understand how stakeholders expect the system to work and formulate requirements based on those expectations. By acting as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, the business analyst brings an understanding of not only how the work needs to be done but why it needs to be done in that particular way. There are various ways to get this information, from analyzing documentation to interviews and surveys. 4. Creating requirements specifications After requirements have been gathered, the next step is to formalize them by creating a written specification. [LINKED_TEXT: Software requirements specification] [URL: https://www.apriorit.com/white-papers/706-srs-development] plays an important role in software engineering. This document can be shared with stakeholders. Writing a specification demands a specific set of skills and technologies that will make the requirements clear to stakeholders and useful to developers. Besides requirements specifications, a BA may provide mockups or wireframes of new features. This is a great benefit to the team because developers don’t have to think about the design themselves. 5. Translating requirements to the team After a requirements specification is written and reviewed by stakeholders, it needs to be presented to the development team. The team has to understand all the requirements and get answers to any questions they might have. A BA’s success in communicating information largely depends on the way they understand the team, their strong and weak points, and their understanding of the business domain. 6. Performing acceptance testing When a feature is implemented, the BA needs to check whether it meets all requirements. In order to do this, acceptance testing is usually performed at the last stages of feature development. Passing acceptance testing signifies the product is complete and ready to be released. In addition, it’s a common practice for business analysts on Agile projects to show a demo at the end of every sprint. The demo is presented to stakeholders to show them the workflow and progress within the sprint. While we’ve covered the gist of what business analysts do, there’s much more to the role.

What is the greatest team to not win that years championship, and what is the greatest era of a team that did not produce a championship? (The bitter disappointment of not winning) The best team to ever finish second has a clear cut favourite. No disrespect to theShowtime Lakers and Bird’s Celtics, who notably finished as runners up a combined 6 times and Isiah’s Pistons who came so close to winning in ’88 before winning in ‘89. The ’13 Spurs probably came the closest to having the trophy before it was tragically ripped away by the Miami Heatles. It has to be the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors. People seem to have forgotten their story. After LeBron’s monster Finals performance and Durant’s addition, the narrative became “the Warriors needed Durant”. Now, obviously them winning this season has changed that but lets quickly recap: 2014–15: 67–15 regular season record. 1st in defensive rating, second in offensive rating. Many basketball commentators were apprehensive about their chances of winning a title. Remember, in 2015 people still hadn’t gotten over the classic “Jump shooting teams can’t win championships” maxim. This was also the season after the Spurs had won the title in dominant fashion, with Kawhi to take the next step in becoming a super star, AND LeBron going to Cleveland to team up with Kyrie and Kevin Love. They win the title and immediately got slung with the qualifier “it was against an injured Cavs team”. Not to say it isn’t true, but this was the impetus for the Warriors to come FIRING the next season. Que Stephen Curry to win the first, and only, ever unanimous MVP, torching the NBA for 30 points a night with 50,45 and 90 splits. The Warriors win 73 games in dominant fashion, including an astonishing 24–0 start to the season. They blew out the Cavs and Spurs, the nearest title contenders, by 30+ points back to back. They seemed absolutely untouchable, and had they won the title there would have been some fierce debate about them being the greatest team ever. The greatest era of a team? There are a few stand outs: The Jazz in the 90s were a perenially 50+ game win team, led by two players in the 5 best ever in their position. They got to 2 Finals in a stacked Western Conference. They had to battle against Olajuwon’s champion Rockets, Payton and Kemps Supersonics, the young Kobe and Shaq Lakers and the Spurs with David Robinson. Had it not been for the dominance of the Bulls, one of the greatest ever teams, they might have a ring or two. We also tend to forget the 7 Seconds or Less Suns. They had everything with the one-two punch of Nash and Stoudemire, in the model of Malone and Stockton. They had a star player in Shawn Marion and played a new style of up-tempo basketball that caught the NBA by surprise, and are credited with changing the NBA forever with their three point barrages. The best team for me has to be the 60s Lakers. Elgin Baylor and Jerry West were two of the five best players of the whole DECADE on the same team. They went to 7 Finals together, losing 6 to the Russell Celtics and once to the Knicks. Making 7 Finals without winning has to qualify them as the best of the rest, separating themselves from the other perpetual runner ups."},{"instruction":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

Let's say you need a roofer to repair your roof. You look through many reviews and narrow your search down to two roofers. They're both equally highly rated. You call each roofer individually. In each conversation you describe the situation of your roof (e.g. it's a gable roof, made of shingles, has a few leaks, etc.), and you ask each roofer how much they charge and what their thoughts are. They both charge the same amount, and the only difference between them as far as you can tell is: Roofer A says he has dealt with your type of roof problem COUNTLESS times. He knows EXACTLY what to do. It should be a simple repair - done in 3 days MAX or your money back.Roofer B says he has dealt with the problem several times. It shouldn't be too much of an issue, and he can probably do it in 4 days, given that it doesn't rain. Well, so, you pick Roofer A and.... HE DOES A GREAT JOB!!! He even fixes the problem in 1 day. You're thrilled. It turns out that Roofer A is also a really genuine, friendly, person and you guys have several common interests such as bocce ball and beach body building. You pay Roofer A a good tip and recommend him to all your friends with gable roofs. (Almost all your friends have gable roofs.) But what if Roofer B would have actually done a better job? What if: Roofer B actually has 10 more years of experience than Roofer A, has actually fixed your particular roof problem 20 times before, AND would have used a higher quality tar compound that you know nothing aboutRoofer A actually only encountered your roof problem 11 times before (and he lost count after 4)And both roofers could have fixed your roof problem in 5 hours. Roofer A just took a little longer than that because you and him kept talking about bocce ball strategy At the time of making your decision, all the knowledge you had to base your decision on was how each roofer came across in the phone conversation, because reading the online reviews had already led you to the indecisive conclusion that they were both highly reviewed roofers. From the phone call, Roofer A sounded like he knew what he was doing more so than Roofer B. So you picked Roofer A. I would have too. So you didn't know that Roofer B was actually better for the job. And guess what? YOU NEVER WILL. And neither would your interviewer, grad-school-admissions-person-reviewing-your-application, or could've-been-future-spouse know how great you could've been instead of the Roofer A that they chose. Arguably, confidence shapes everything others can initially perceive about you: the way you talk, your body language, the words you use, etc. Neither roofers lied. They were both telling the truth, and they were both competent. Confidence (or the lack-of) is also cyclical: Roofer A will now get more opportunities and new business thrown his way because you loved the great job he did and you are going to recommend him to all your friends that have gable roofs (and even friends that have hip roofs!) When for some reason Roofer A fails, it also won't get to him as much because he'll think about it, make a mental note of lessons learned, and blame the rest on the roof (because that particular roof really was a rare problem), and then continue succeeding (because Roofer A is also an [LINKED_TEXT: optimist] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-unfair-advantage-a-person-can-have/answer/None]).Roofer B will start to doubt himself for why he didn't win your business. He'll continue to get roofing jobs, but he might also bump into a roof that is un-fixable. He'll think about it, blame himself, and won't be able to get past it. He'll start to think that maybe he's a terrible roofer and quit his calling altogether. Three months later on your morning jog, you find him under the bridge downtown, wearing a hoodie, drinking a 40, listening to [LINKED_TEXT: RHCP] [URL: http://www.quora.com/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-band/What-is-your-favourite-RHCP-song-and-is-there-a-reason-for-inclination-to-it-compared-to-other-song/answer/Sam-Harris-13?srid=tHVN&share=1]. A tragic outcome. In the example above, both roofers were equally competent, but one was more confident. In reality, getting confidence is not easy and requires a lot of hard work, experience, and competence. Here's a great article about it: [LINKED_TEXT: How to Develop Unshakeable Self Confidence] [URL: http://www.caseinterview.com/self-confidence-vs-esteem]. Also, people who are confident when they are not competent are dangerous, because others will trust them even though they are leading people off of a cliff. A more realistic example involving confidence might be MBA school interviews. At some schools, there is an interview process in which about half of those that are invited to interview are admitted. The overall admission rate might be less than 10%, but to the overjoyed person who gets the interview invitation, that rate now looks like 50%. The school might be thinking that they have gleaned all they could from the paper applications, so they've selected their top candidates for interview. So at the interview stage, everyone is sort of on equal ground, and as the person being interviewed, you now have 30-45 minutes to make a good impression. Guess what's kind of important in that short span of time: CONFIDENCE. (Note: I know very little about grad school admissions and therefore I wasn't very confident in writing the above paragraph; I used words such as \\"might\\", \\"sort of\\", \\"about\\", and that has led you to be less confident about everything you just read. The above did happen to me though, and I wasn't admitted, and it hurt.)"},{"instruction":"the UK, can a resident get him/herself checked (e.g. blood tests, scans) for cancer free of charge on NHS?

Of course. Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms? If you have no symptoms, and nothing else to suggest that you might have cancer, why would you expect resources to be wasted on arbitrarily giving you expensive, labour-intensive tests? There are people out there who do have symptoms and do have things to suggest that they might have cancer, and who need checks because qualified, competent medical professionals think it’s necessary, and you want them to get in line behind you; someone who wants tests just for fun?

You don’t diagnose yourself, and you don’t tell your doctor what you want to be tested for. They diagnose you, and they decide what (if anything) to test you for, because they’re doctors and they studied for years, maybe decades and have throughout their training and subsequent careers been constantly scrutinised and made to demonstrate that they know what they’re talking about.

It is a common desire to lose some fat from the cheeks and overall face to change the overall appearance. Well, losing body fat does require making different kinds of long-term changes to your lifestyle and diet. Read along to learn about the best strategies that you may follow to reduce some of those stubborn face fat: Overall weight loss: Losing weight overall can help reduce face fat. Try creating a calorie deficit in your body by consuming lesser calories than you burn. You may attain this by combining regular exercises with a balanced and healthy diet. Stay hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water can help prevent water retention and bloating in the face. It is important to drink at least 8-9 glasses of water every day. Cardiovascular exercises: Engage in regular aerobic exercises such as jogging, cycling or swimming. These activities help burn calories and contribute to overall weight loss, including the reduction of face fat. Facial exercises: Specific exercises can help tone the muscles in your face and reduce face fat. Some exercises include cheek lifts, blowing air into balloons and chewing gum to work the muscles around the jawline. Healthy diet: Consume a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods high in sodium, as they can contribute to bloating and water retention. Facial massage: Gentle facial massages can improve blood circulation, reduce fluid retention and give your face a more toned appearance. Use your fingertips to massage your face in circular motions, starting from the chin and moving upwards. Limit alcohol and salt intake: Excessive alcohol consumption and high sodium intake can lead to facial bloating and puffiness. Limit your alcohol intake and avoid high-sodium foods to reduce water retention in the face. It is important to note that the distribution of fat in the body is largely determined by genetics, so it is important to set realistic expectations. It is not possible to target fat loss in specific areas, but by adopting a healthy lifestyle overall, you can reduce overall body fat, which will include a reduction in face fat."},{"instruction":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","output":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?

I have observed this many times, successfull submission count at Codechef hitting in 100’s within first 3–4 minute itself for CookOff and LunchTime.CookOff and LunchTime are short duration contest unlike LongChallenge.The evaluation of a participant’s score is not only based on accuracy but also on the time he/she submitted the solution. The earlier he/she submits, the higher the score will be. The first question at CookOff and LunchTime is always a cakewalk problem. It is deliberately added by authors to warm up the contestants. Even if you read the question slowly any newbie coder would be able to come up with the solution. The solution for such cakewalk questions require simple math or array manipulation.The top coders (at platforms like Codechef, Spoj or Codeforces) have been competing at such short-duration contest from years. They would have solved 100’s of questions on the Codechef itself (and 100’s more at other platforms like Codeforces, Spoj and TopCoder)With such massive experience, the top coders already knew the solution for cakewalk problem. They had already faced the same cakewalk problems (or its variants) 100’s of time before. They had reached at such tipping point, where they don’t need to think for the solution, because it is already been memorizedMost of the top competitive coders maintain a ready-template of their programming language , like the one below usually followed for C++. So, when a cakewalk problem comes up, due to above mentioned point, a top coder would need to type 2 or 3 lines of code #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; int main() { int number_of_testcases, ans; cin>>number_of_testcases; while(number_of_testcases--){ //add the problem specific solution here cout<<ans<<endl; } return 0; } 5. So, now our top competitive coder reads the short description of a cakewalk problem within a minute. The problem triggers a solution in his/her mind. He/She types that 2–3 line solution in his/her template, copies the content to submit editor on Codechef and hits Submit! Hence, you see that submission count around 100–200 within first 3–5 minutes. On a side note:Even if the cakewalk problem is new to the coder, solution for such problem can be easily imagined within first 2 minutes. Many of the competitive coders are touch typist. Touch typing saves time while coding. Touch typist never peep into keyboard while typing. I suggest learn touch typing.It’s the same principle we apply while using IDE’s. If we are going to use a tool like an IDE for a long amount of time, it’s better to learn its shortcuts. You can apply this same principle for learning touch typing. If we are going to use a tool like keyboard for software development for majority of time duration of our career then it is better to learn touch typing as it saves TIME!.

This guide will provide you with valuable tips and strategies to help you find the cheapest flights and hotels, ensuring that you save money without compromising on comfort or quality. 1. Be Flexible with Travel Dates: One of the key factors in finding affordable flights and hotels is flexibility. Avoid peak travel seasons and consider traveling during weekdays instead of weekends. By being open to adjusting your travel dates, you increase your chances of finding better deals as airlines and hotels often offer lower prices during off-peak periods. 2. Compare Multiple Travel Websites: Don't settle for the first flight or hotel option you come across. Take advantage of online travel websites that allow you to compare prices across different airlines and accommodations. Websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, Expedia, and [LINKED_TEXT: Booking.com: The largest selection of hotels, homes, and vacation rentals] [URL: http://booking.com/] are great platforms to start your search. Comparing prices will give you a clear idea of what's available and help you find the most affordable options. 3. Sign Up for Price Alerts: Many travel websites and airlines offer price alert services, allowing you to receive notifications when there are significant price drops or promotions. By subscribing to these alerts, you can stay updated on the latest deals and snatch up discounted flights and hotel rooms as soon as they become available. 4. Utilize Incognito Browsing: When searching for flights and hotels, use private or incognito browsing mode in your web browser. This prevents travel websites from tracking your search history and raising prices based on your repeated searches. Incognito mode helps you see more accurate pricing information and prevents potential price manipulation. 5. Consider Alternative Airports and Accommodations: Expanding your search to include nearby airports or alternative accommodations can significantly reduce costs. Check if there are budget airlines operating from secondary airports near your destination. Additionally, consider options like vacation rentals or guesthouses instead of traditional hotels. These alternatives often offer lower prices and can provide a unique and authentic travel experience. 6. Book in Advance: Generally, booking your flights and hotels well in advance can result in better deals. Airlines and hotels tend to increase their prices as the departure or check-in dates approach. By booking early, you can secure lower rates and have peace of mind knowing that your travel arrangements are in place. 7. Be Open to Connecting Flights: Direct flights are often more convenient but can be more expensive. If you're willing to make a stopover or take connecting flights, you can often find cheaper options. Explore different airlines and flight routes to see if there are affordable options with layovers. Similarly, if you have the time, consider longer layovers as they can sometimes be an opportunity to explore a new city at no additional cost. 8. Consider Package Deals: Sometimes, booking flights and hotels together as part of a package can save you money. Travel agencies or online platforms often offer discounted rates when you book your entire trip, including flights and accommodation, in one go. Take the time to compare the prices of individual bookings versus package deals to see which option offers the most significant savings.

So it may be a little too late to try to improve your dissertation writing while you are already writing it. Even if you do manage to improve it quickly, unless you plan to go into academia or pursue a career in writing, your academic writing skills probably won’t be that important to you.

The Jews claim to be descendants of Abram. The Brahmins of India say they came from Bramha.","output":"This question is based on the fallacy of false equivalents based on phonics. Abraham translated literally, means “father of a multitude.”Sarah means noblewoman or princess. They are the mythical ancestors of the Jewish people, and since the Christians and Muslims adopted aspects of the Jewish religion and modified it to suit their purposes they too claim Abraham and Sarah as their progenitors. Brahmā comes from the Sanskrit root Brh and means “Great” and refers to the Principle of creation.Sarasvati means “she-who-flows” and refers to knowledge, information and data – the means by which her consort Brahmā creates the multiple universes. The one couple is the mythical ancestors of the monotheists and the other the mythical generators of the entire Universe with its multiple galaxies and dimensions. So there is absolutely no connection between them. This reminds me of a real time situation that arose when an Australia visited Egypt. He took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and offered the driver a 200 pound note. The driver said fish-fakka (which means “I have no change”) the Australian thought it was a novel way of swearing and so he began to abuse the driver with very colourful Aussies curses, the concierge noting the impasse gently explained to the Aussie what the confusion was about the similar sounding phrase.

Presenting such a mob of troglodytes with a well-researched book about Donald Trump is at best casting pearls before swine; they are going to chew it up without any consideration whatsoever and turn it into filth they can wallow in.

Most of you may remember this image. It is a grisly, iconic, Pulitzer Prize-winning photo from the Vietnam War that shocked the world. My eyes were always strangely drawn to the Executioner, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The blend of his menacing face, the nonchalance in shooting the man, one must wonder, what leads a person down this path to villainy? How could one so quickly kill a bound, unarmed prisoner? Upon my further investigation - this might be one of the most misunderstood photos in history. The plainly dressed victim might resemble a normal pedestrian - but he was no ordinary prisoner. He was the leader of a Vietcong death squad, that had infiltrated Saigon with the express purpose of assassinating a long list of people. He had personally executed several military officers and their entire families. He was found standing over a grave with 34 bodies in it, that included women and children that had been killed execution style. Following this famous photo, Loan continued fighting in the war for several years. He was later injured, losing one leg. Loan and his wife eventually escaped to the US. Where he had 5 children and owned a restaurant in Virginia. But his life was haunted by the photo that was taken of him as he was held up as a standard bearer for the evils of war. Loan's property was frequently vandalized and he was targeted by various outlets over the years. The photographer, Eddie Adams, was deeply regretful of ever having taken the picture. He knew Loan well and stated that he was a good man and misrepresented. Adams felt he captured two deaths in that photo: that of the victim and that of Loan. And - to be clear - this answer is not an attempt to absolve this man of all blame. This is dark stuff. However, what Loan did was not far beyond the bounds of what other soldiers were doing. War is and has always been hell. To pretend it is anything less is to pretend fire isn't hot. So before making demons of men, remember: given the wrong circumstances, we are all capable of terrible things. After all, we are human."},{"instruction":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","output":"When I lived out in Denver, my wife and I would walk the 16th Street mall regularly.

We were sitting near our server, and it was a slow period of the day (it was after the lunch rush, but before the dinner rush). When she wasn't taking care of us (or other tables), she was rolling up silverware into napkins. It was clear that she wasn't having a good day, and it showed by how she rolled the silverware. We chatted with her, and learned that she was having family issues, along with going through school and was pregnant. Having two young kids ourselves, who weren't with us at that time, we empathized with her. While it was clear she was having a tough time, interacting with her as a server, one would never tell. We were both impressed at how well she was able to do that, with everything going on, and still keep a smile on her face.

Typing in commands into the command prompt might look tedious, but you can then copypaste them and/or save them into a text file (usually called a “script”), and use this text file to repeat the same set of actions again and again. You can use that text file to easily perform the same action across a thousand of servers. There are tools to automate the GUI tasks in a similar way, but they are nowhere near as reliable or easy to use. You can also easily reuse most of a previous command if only one thing (such as the name of the file) changed, no such option with a GUI. Imagine you need to zip some folder, move that zipped file to google drive, and then delete the source folder. If you just do it once, I bet it’s easier to use the GUI, why would anyone bother with the command line, I hear you ask. Now imagine you need to do the same thing for a different folder once every few days. With the GUI you need to do to the whole thing from scratch every time. With the command line you can reuse the previous command by copypasting it and changing just the name of the folder to apply it to, saving massive amounts of time in the long run. Another reason is the virtually infinite flexibility - everything that can be done with a GUI can be done from the command line, while not everything that can be done from the command line can be done from the GUI. That is because command line is closer to the messy reality of how your operating system actually works underneath, while GUI is basically a nice window dressing hiding the command line reality below. This leads to another important aspect - the command line is almost guaranteed to work, very important especially for rescuing computers. The GUI is basically a cherry on top of an operating system, and it requires the vast majority of the operating system to work correctly, otherwise it also fails to work. Command line, on the other hand, is one of the minimum things that an OS will have working if it manages to start at all. I’ve seen plenty of computers in my life in which GUI failed to start, but the command line worked just fine and could be used to rescue the computer. I have never seen a computer in which the command line failed to work but the GUI was fine and could be used for rescue purposes, I don’t think that’s even possible. Also, GUIs are costly in terms of CPU and RAM use. That doesn’t really matter on your personal computer, since its main purpose is for you to interact with it, so it would be crazy to make savings by reducing interactivity. But on a business server used to serve a website or process some data, the primary purpose is different and direct interaction with human users occurs only when necessary (software updates, backups, and such), for the most part they are to be left alone. For them it makes no sense to pay the cost of a GUI just to use it once in a few days or even weeks. That is why most servers do not have GUIs and command line is the only way to communicate with them."},{"instruction":"w did algorithms predicting Hillary Clinton’s landslide victory in the 2016 Presidential Election get their prediction so wrong?","output":"Insofar as I can tell, there were several issues. Several, pollsters regular talked about throughout the election cycle. America has changed insofar as the use of pollsters using landlines to conduct their polling and the people in the US who actually have/use landlines. The people that have landlines tend to skew older and are more likely to have voted for Trump, so that makes zero sense so that’s my issue with that excuse, although overall it’s 100% true that the landline is becoming as obsolete as the covered wagon. The other thing that is more likely, and you did hear, is that polls are live surveys. It’s a live person asking you your voting preferences. Even then Trump was so polarizing and the perception was that a vote for Trump was a vote for segregated schools and oppressed women and who knows what. Pogroms (although Ivanka Trump is Jewish)? So the respondent could have felt one thing and answered another. It also depends who they were polling. If the sample was the following: In a survey of 1000 voters they indicated the following affiliation: 460 Democrats, 100 Independents, 420 Republicans, 20 Other That sample is already fairly imbalanced. It looks like they did a good job getting a good representation. But it’s unlikely that the independents are going to be a precise 50/50. They had the same fear of looking biased to the pollster on the phone. In a market research study, we use screeners so as not to taint the results. We ask questions and, if someone suddenly gives an answer that suddenly no longer makes them eligible for the research, we thank them for their time and abort. It avoids a sample that is biased or that won’t answer our ultimate question. What should have happened here is the following: They need 500 Democrats and 500 Republicans. They call until the talk to 500 Democrats. Once they get 500, they keep calling and then every time they get a Democrat, they thank them and discontinue asking questions.

GDP growth has fallen sharply in most countries, and there are no signs of improvement. Stock markets have plummeted, crude oil prices have plummeted, inflation is rising and real estate markets across the world are still stuck in doldrums. And even though automobile industry has been seeing some growth recently, it's still not out of the woods yet because consumers are still wary about buying new cars when there is so much uncertainty about jobs and wages in their country or city. Every setback for the economy has been a time to buy as well As an investor, you should always be aware of the risks. In this section, we will take a look at whether or not we are headed into a recession. The last two recessions were caused by financial crises in the US and Europe respectively. Every setback for the economy has been a time to buy as well. For example: ● During 2000-2002; emerging markets such as India were among those hit hardest by contagion from global central banks’ interest rate cuts. However, they also had some of their best years after these recessions ended (see our article “India: A Growth Story). ● Similarly, 2017 was an excellent year for emerging markets due to rising commodity prices (a result of massive Chinese demand) and strong growth in both China and India (see our article “Is this Bull Market Just Getting Started?”). Credit growth has been muted since the days of the IL&FS crisis Credit growth is one of the most important indicators of the health of an economy. If a country is able to maintain healthy credit growth, it’s usually a sign that people are confident about the future and willing to borrow money from banks. However, credit growth in India has been muted since the days of the IL&FS crisis in August 2018. This could be a sign that consumer confidence is low, or it could be an indication that people aren’t using their savings on investments—they are hoarding cash instead. But, historically what happens during a recession on the stock market? The market is a leading indicator of economic activity. It typically falls before the economy tanks and then recovers before the economy starts growing again. In 2007, as the Great Recession began to take shape, the S&P 500 index dropped by more than 50%. The market crashed not long after that, with many stocks losing over 80% of their value in a matter of months. But by March 2009—when the job market hit rock bottom—the S&P 500 was up nearly 30%, having recovered its losses in less than two years' time (and this despite an additional three years of recession!). How does one stay safe during a recession? As we inch closer to a possible recession, it is important that you take steps now so that you can stay safe and secure during such times. ● Don't invest in the stock market. The volatility of the stock market can be dangerous. Avoid making any major investments until the economy has stabilized again. ● Invest in gold or secure funds instead of stocks: If you must invest, opt for gold or a government-backed scheme such as Ulips or PPF (Public Provident Fund). These will ensure that your money is safe even if there's an economic downturn in future as they are not linked to volatile markets like equities are. ● Keep income steady: In times of recession, people often cut down on entertainment expenses like eating out at restaurants or travelling abroad; however this may not be enough to save money quickly enough if inflation rises significantly during such times so it's important not only to curb unnecessary expenditure but also try increasing your income wherever possible by doing freelance work etcetera if needed! You might also want t consider taking up freelance jobs on sites like Fiverr which pay their users pretty well! Withdrawal of funds from your investments and putting them into savings account that pays interest won't help. You could consider small savings schemes instead of parking your money in bank savings accounts or fixed deposits. It's not a good time to withdraw money from your investments and put it into savings accounts that pay interest. You could consider small savings schemes instead of parking your money in bank savings accounts or fixed deposits. As the economy starts to slow down, it is not a good idea to be greedy. It is better to invest in gold than anything else at this point of time because gold has been considered as one of the safest investment options for decades now and its value doesn't depreciate too much even when there is economic slowdown or recession. Investing in gold is one of the best options to hedge against inflation and protect capital. However, it is not a regular income producing instrument. I personally keep around 5-10% of my portfolio in gold as an insurance for emergencies and for wealth protection. During volatile times, investors would do well to keep some portion of their investment portfolio in gold as insurance from market fluctuations, debts and inflationary shocks.

During volatile times, investors would do well to keep some portion of their investment portfolio in gold as insurance from market fluctuations, debts and inflationary shocks. In addition to this personal preference, I have seen many people diversifying their portfolios with gold ETFs because they feel that it will protect them against a recession by providing liquidity during market downturns. The choice of whether or not you want to invest your hard earned money into something like this should ultimately come down to your own risk appetite - but here are three reasons why I think investing in gold could be right for you: Wrapping Up ● Recession is part of the business cycle, which means it's cyclical. It comes and goes like a storm—and when it comes again, you might be better prepared than ever before. ● Decrease spending as much as possible to keep your business going strong in the long-term. ● Don't panic or give up hope! Recessions don't last forever, and there are always ways to adapt and adjust during them. ● With careful planning and preparation beforehand, there's no reason why you can't weather any recession that comes your way with ease!"},{"instruction":"What are some arguments I can make to fight a fire hydrant ticket?

The first is something I regularly order at sit-down breakfast restaurants (Village Inn, IHOP, Dennys, and similar): French toast covered in sausage gravy, specifically requesting that they do NOT dust the French toast in powdered sugar. A side dish of hash browns smothered in grilled peppers and onions, topped with melted cheese, makes a divine breakfast. The second is something I order at my local Whataburger: I order a double meat Whataburger Jr with bacon, extra cheese, and grilled peppers and onions, and a Breakfast on a Bun (egg, cheese, sausage patty) with double extra cheese. I then ask them to specifically put the fixings for the breakfast on a bun inside the Whataburger Jr. End result is burger, cheese, sausage, cheese, burger, cheese, bacon, egg and the grilled peppers and onions on top between the buns…the extra cheese then goes on the other bun as a plain grilled cheese. If for any reason, the counter clerk or management won’t make that sandwich for me, I simply order them individually, then take the top bun off the Whataburger Jr, take the bottom bun off the breakfast sandwich, and I have my grilled cheese, then I take the rest of the Breakfast on a bun, and set it on top of the Whataburger Jr…might not be as neatly built as when the staff makes it as ordered, but at least I get my sandwiches without argument :)"},{"instruction":"f you and your wife were laying in bed and you both hear a noise downstairs at 3 AM, do you believe that it is your duty as a man to investigate the noise and put yourself at potential risk to protect you and your wife?

So, Tissue culture can make true-to-type mother plant multiplication (like photocopying from an original), in a short span of time, in large numbers, uniform and throughout the year.

The engine had been lying inactive for the orbiter’s entire journey so far and it was a concern whether it will function efficiently and timely on demand.This successful four seconds burn on Monday has corrected the trajectory and has also ensured that the rocket is functioning properly and is ready for the 24 minutes long firing on September 24.

In real terms, when distributed over the population of 1.2 billion, every Indian has contributed Rs.4 per towards the mission. Mangalyaan will observe the environment of Mars and look for various elements like methane (marsh gas), which is a possible indicator of life. It will also look for Deuterium-Hydroden ratio and other neutral constants.

I mean really married as 1. actually married 2. having spent enough years married that you really know some one with out guess work, I would have said yes.

I die doing something stupid like standing up to a mugger and my wife is left alone both angry and sad. My wife will very clearly tell anyone that she would rather buy a new television than pay for a funeral, she would much rather lose a pretty piece of jewelry than mourn me and thinks it is very selfish , and has told me such, for me to stupidly risk my life knowing that my death would make her very sad for something as unimportant as things. She has told me the message is that you love the TV more than me. Of course going to check out the noise. But I can not ever imagine jumping up and racing straight to a sound . That is entering blindly with no situational awareness. I have heard and investigated noises before. First you hear the noise , second you listen for more noises, then you talk about what you think it might have been and decide where it came from. Then one of you starts to get up , the other asks if you want them to come with you. This is basically how real life works. If I thought it were dangerousI would have her come with me , you never seperate , movies teach you that. In the case where I was fairly sure it was an intruder, we would get the guns and the mobile,. go into the bathroom, get in the tub and call the police. In any scenario the police are going to show up anyway. I would much rather they have to do their paperwork for shooting some one then me after already being woken up at 3 am , having a very traumatic experience of killing some one in my house, then have to go through all the headache of paper work over it. The cops volunteered to work doing that, they are paid to do it, the expect to deal with it, and our local government has decided they should be the ones to deal with it.

It might seem cowardly, but , it is heroic and here is how it is heroic, I am choosing the protection of my family over grand delusions of seeming heroic. The desire to be the hero is a selfish ego act, the protecting of my wife is the act of selflessness and maturity, because there is going to always be a time after an intruder that has to be dealt with.

I would have still put this the same way if he were alive. While watching the movie \`The fault in our stars’ 2 years back, I cried. It touched, it hurt, it made me shed a few tears, and left with a kind of feeling that makes you think, feel, connect, and more importantly, it made me feel something beautiful. Each and everything about that movie was just amazing. I don't think I have the right vocabulary to express what exactly I want to convey. But you guys are smart to get my point. (Image courtesy: APKPure) When I watched Dil Bechara yesterday, none of these things happened. Most of the time, I couldn't hear the dialogues properly as they decided to put little loud background music when the were speaking dialogues. Why so much background score unnecessary was beyond my understanding. (Image courtesy: The Hindu) Mix up of languages (Bangali with English and Hindi) and subtitles weren't doing any good for me either. All I kept saying, “What was the dialogue?” Every scene I had this feeling, yes, I saw this in \`The fault in our stars’ movie. I knew what was going to happen next, and that killed all the excitement because I hadn't seen the trailer of Dil Bechara movie. I wish I had seen that. Otherwise, my excitement of why so many people are praising the movie would not have left me wondering. Yes, at many scenes, I felt a little sad for Sushant that we will not be able to see him again, but that's just pure human emotions that every one of us would have felt while watching this movie. All in all, for me, nothing worked to touch me in any way whatsoever. You know what, it simply wasn't good enough for me to any degree. Finally, for me, Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters’ \`The fault in our stars’ wins big time over Kizie Basu and Immanuel Rajkumar Junior’s ‘Dil Bechara’. Just one question: Why can't they come up with something original?

During the 1877 Martian opposition, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835–1910) observed the red planet and produced a series of drawings which included an intricate array of channels. He naturally referred to these structures as canali, the Italian word for ‘channels.’ The image below, a reproduction published in 1962 by the US Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, displays these markings in the locations that Schiaparelli indicated. His observations captivated many scientists and lay people alike, many of whom mistranslated the word ‘canali’ as ‘canals.’* ‘The word ‘channel’ differs significantly from the word ‘canal,’ for while winds and other natural phenomena can sculpt the former, the latter implies the presence of an intelligence. The existence of ‘Martian canals’ particularly intrigued Percival Lowell (1855–1916), a wealthy entrepreneur and passionate astronomy enthusiast. He developed a theory that these ‘canals’ were constructed by a race of Martians desperately trying to irrigate their lands in response to a planet-wide drought. Lowell was so convinced in his theory that he funded the construction of the Lowell Observatory, which was completed in 1894.** His stated aim was to find Martians Lowell was not actually expecting to see Martians frantically scurrying about like an ant swarm. Even if they existed, such small creatures could never be resolvable over such large distances. Instead, he hoped to observe the canals expanding as the parched Martians worked indefatigably to save themselves from extinction. Lowell’s work eventually drew the attention of British author HG Wells (1866–1946) who wrote ‘War of the Worlds’ as a serial novel between the years 1895–1897. This highly-acclaimed novel imagined an invasion by desperate Martians determined to conquer Earth and extract its resources. The implication was that Mars, itself, had become depleted of its own resources either through geological processes or the gross mismanagement of them by the Martians. (Yes, Wells intended his work as a cautionary tale.) On Halloween night 1938 the aptly named “Mercury Theatre on the Air” produced a radio dramatization of this novel with Orson Welles -no relation, obviously- as the narrator. The show was designed as a faux news broadcast about a Martian invasion. Despite the inclusion of disclaimers which indicated that the broadcast was fictional, something of a panic ensued in many regions around the country. We should mention that the extent of that panic has become highly exaggerated. Many listeners were indeed frightened by the broadcast, but the notion that hundreds or even thousand perished either by suicide or in resultant stampedes is wholly false. However, there was panic, as noted by the New York Times: So, a minor panic erupts after a 1938 radio broadcast about a Martian invasion that was based on a novel written by a man who based his work on Lowell’s theory that Martians were building canals. This theory was predicated on a mistranslation of the Italian word ‘canali,’ which actually means ‘channels.’ And, as it turns out, these channels don’t even exist in the first place. Instead, as some researchers believe, Schiaparelli was likely just seeing a reflection of veins within his own eye! Whether or not astronomy ends up being a net positive for humanity is an issue that may never be resolved. *One exasperated linguist was purported to have once lamented, ‘So many people think Italian is just English augmented with superfluous vowels.’ **This observatory, located in Arizona, has become one of the world’s most famous astronomical research facilities. It was here that Vesto Slipher (1875–1969) made the first observations related to the Universal expansion. Also noteworthy: American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (1906–1997) discovered Pluto in 1930 while working on the Lowell Observatory staff."},{"instruction":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","output":"we all have traveled by train at least once in our life .Apart from a memorable experience, there are many other thing about railways that might surprise you.

I thought the pianist’s fingerings and hand positions were sloppy. True confessions: I will admit that I’ve been guilty of similar sloppiness from time to time. But I don’t do it on YouTube, and certainly not in an instructional video. It’s vital for you to develop good habits while you are still a beginner. You may be able to get away with sloppy technique later on, when you’re more advanced. But not as a beginner. I realize that last paragraph may sound strange, so I’ll give you an analogy. Have you ever seen a professional baseball player fight off a pitch with an ugly, off-balance swing and wind up with a base hit? The swing that earned him the base hit might have been ugly. But he wouldn’t have made it to the majors if his underlying mechanics were lacking. After you have developed the habit of playing with correct mechanics, you will be able to play without concentrating on technique. You have not yet arrived at that point. Good piano posture is more important than many students realize. You should be careful to sit at the piano with correct posture and to hold your fingers in the correct position at all times. You should practice arpeggios and chords in both hands because they are basic keyboard techniques. Start by isolating a single hand. If you’re practicing chords. play a triad with one hand, being careful to hit all three keys at the exact same time. With your left hand, practice basic combinations like C-E-G and C-F-A.If you’re practicing arpeggios, start with a three-note arpeggio in one hand: C→E→G or C→F→A. After you’re comfortable with a three-note arpeggio, add a fourth note at the top: C→E→G→C. Once you have mastered the chord or arpeggio in each hand separately, play it with both hands together, in parallel octaves. After you become comfortable playing with both hands performing similar tasks, you can advance to having your hands performing different tasks at the same time. Start by breaking the piece down, one hand at a time. Practice each hand’s part separately until you can do it in your sleep. And then combine the two hands."},{"instruction":"On Yom Kippur the Jews ask for forgiveness from other Jews. Why don't they ask for forgiveness from the rest of us too?

When you open this account, be sure you invest enough money to cover your bankroll for an entire season or year, not just a single game. To ensure you have enough money, multiply your base bet by at least 100, and that’s the minimum amount you should keep in this account at all times. If you're new to sports betting and don’t know your base bet, put in whatever money you have set aside for this venture and determine your base bet on the size of your bankroll (each bet should represent one to two percent). 2. Create accounts with a few sportsbooks. In order to place bets, you have to have an account with at least one sportsbook, though it’s ideal to have at least three, because then you can compare offerings and place smarter bets. Some sportsbooks also offer signup bonuses, so be sure to shop around. Most sportsbooks are available online these days, and some of the more popular sites include: Bookmaker Bovada Betonline 3. Learn to make smart bets. There are a number of rules that apply to this, and while some are about the numbers, others are about which teams you should and shouldn’t bet on. For instance, while each bet should represent about one to two percent of your bankroll, you can reduce this to 0.5 percent if you aren't confident about a bet. Similarly, you can increase the bet if you're very confident, but never place a bet that exceeds four percent of your bankroll. There are also some experts who say never to place a bet if you aren't confident, because it’s better to walk away and find a better bet that you feel good about. Many experts recommend not betting on your home team in any sport, because your bias can cloud your judgement, and this can lead to great losses. 4. Create a betting schedule. Don’t just bet on every game: every week, look at the upcoming games and pick the ones you want to bet on based on your confidence in the potential bet. Don’t be afraid to walk away from a bet right before the game. Odds change, lines change, and point spreads change, and if you're no longer confident about a bet, either don’t make it or reduce the bet. 5. Don’t chase bad bets. This refers to the practice of trying to recoup losses from a previous bet with more betting. It’s dangerous to do this because many people will set aside good judgement and place more bad bets in an attempt to win back what was lost, and this results in further losses. The opposite is also true: don’t chase a good bet (one where you won) with more bets in an attempt to win more or double your money. Have a betting schedule or routine and stick to it. 6. Bet sober. This refers to betting with a clear mind and focus. Many people will read this and think it is common sense but you would be surprised how many people break this rule. Emotions can get the best of all of us, and bad decisions can be made from those emotions. \\"Going on Tilt\\" was a term developed when sports bettors let their emotions cloud their best resulting in losing their bankroll. Part 2 of 3:Understanding Sports Betting1. Understand moneylines. The moneyline is a plus or minus number associated with each team involved in a particular match, and it refers to either how much you have to bet to win 100 or how much you'll win if you bet 100. For instance, if a moneyline is Toronto Maple Leafs -200 and Vancouver Canucks +155, it means you have to bet 200 on the Leafs in order to win 100, or you have to bet 100 on the Canucks to win 155. The team associated with the minus number (the Leafs) is the favored team, while the team associated with the plus number (the Canucks) is the underdog. Many gamblers bet on the moneyline in hockey and baseball, because the scores are lower and point spread betting doesn’t make as much sense in these games. However, you can bet on the moneyline for almost every sport. 2. Learn about point spreads. Point spread betting is more popular in games where there's a larger gap between the final scores. In a point spread bet, you don’t just bet on whether a team will win, but also whether that team will win by a specific amount. For instance, if a point spread is Detroit Lions +4, New England Patriots -4, you would bet on whether you thought the Lions would win and if they'd win by more than four points. Again, the team associated with the minus is the favorite and the team associated with the plus is the underdog. 3. Understand parlays. Parlay betting involves making multiple types of bets on the same game. For example, if you combined a moneyline bet and a point spread bet on the same game, this would be a parlay bet. These bets often offer large payouts, but they require a great deal of accuracy. Part 3 of 3:Learning Betting Strategy1. Shop for the best lines. This is where having accounts with multiple sportsbooks will come in handy, because some will offer better moneylines on the same games, meaning you have to risk less for the chance to win the same amount of money. The best time to line shop is about an hour before a game. To get the best value, consider opening accounts with at least three books. 2. Make bets based on the odds. Betting with your head instead of your heart is all about making smart bets based on odds rather than emotions. Sometimes it’s a good idea to bet on the numbers rather than who you think will win, because this can represent a better value if the odds are in your favor. For instance, if you're betting on a baseball game and think the Yankees are going to win, you might still be better off placing your bet on the Jays if the odds are right. 3. Don’t be afraid to bet on the underdog. This doesn’t mean betting on a long shot, but rather betting on the underdog when the odds are right. Sometimes, the favored team is chosen based on popularity rather than skill, so it doesn’t necessarily mean the favorite will win. 4. Take advantage of matched betting. Matched betting involves taking advantage of the bonuses and incentives offered by books to place bets for and against the exact same event. For instance, in a basketball game between the Raptors and the Knicks, you would place a bet for the Raptors and then match that same bet against the Raptors. Matched betting is all about taking advantage of free bets and betting for both possible outcomes on the same game, so this type of betting is as near to risk-free as you can get in gambling."},{"instruction":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","output":"Yes it is.But only if you become a worthwhile one.The question implies a million things.The money, the prestige, the lifestyle that's wrongly associated with such a goal.

If this was possible, we would suffer mental problems. Still, I don't think anyone can predict what kind of impact it would have on us because many different experiments are being conducted worldwide trying to answer this question. All experts seem to agree that our brains are currently only able to use between 2-3%, or at most 15%, of their full potential. We don't know exactly how much energy the brain consumes or how much memory or thought processes take because we're still learning about the brain and how it works. The likelihood of us using 100% of our brain is slim, but if we find out more information, I'm sure it will be beneficial for humanity. I believe that there are currently unknown parts of the brain that scientists haven't discovered yet because there's no way 2-3 per cent could handle all this knowledge. Suppose we were able to use 100% of our brains, though. In that case, we would become telepathic and gain a lot more intelligence and knowledge than we already have because neurons firing at once as they did in one experiment would cause damage to whatever part was trying to do too much work. There are not many possibilities, good or bad, to what would happen if we could use 100% of our brains, but I feel like anything past 10 times more energy used than what we already do could cause damage to parts of the brain where mental activity is taking place. If we were able to use 100% of our brains, it would be a good thing because all of us would have high intelligence and many memories at once. The downside, though, is that there's no way for us to handle stress from every neuron firing at once, which could lead to some form of psychosis or other mental disorders, making using thoughts extremely difficult. There are too many things about the brain that we do not know yet, so it's hard predicting any consequences right now. Still, I think being telepathic and having the intelligence of many people combined would be something truly unique. I believe that we will never achieve 100% of our brain potential because it just seems impossible since we know for a fact that using too much energy can cause damage to the brain. Imagine if every neuron fired at once. This could inflict some form of mental disorder or an overload in thought processes which wouldn't be good for us. We have discovered so much about the brain already, but there are still things being researched, which means no one knows what impact it would have on us if we could use it 100% right now."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"Choosing the best car under 10 lakhs in India depends on various factors like your preferences for fuel efficiency, features, brand reputation, maintenance costs, and the specific needs you have, such as family size or driving conditions.

Basically every fundamental library except the very lowest level ones has extensive metaprogramming involved. Some are to the point where the code you write is a declarative description of what you want done, and there’s a compiler that pulls that apart and builds the workers for a distributed system that will do that operation. All automatically, and it looks like ordinary sequential code. Google is so good at this, it’s even quite straightforward to profile and debug something like that… because the monitoring system, profilers, debugging tools, crash dump analysers, and basically everything else, are all aware of the framework and know how to translate from generated code back to the source. The libraries automatically fill in monitoring, debug, introspection, restartability so if a worker is terminated its work gets redone somewhere else, and any number of other things. They’ve done this in four languages, two of which don’t actually have anything like templates (Go and Python do it with data structures instead, Python by doing abstract execution at module load time; I have no idea how the Go implementation works).

Can they be asked no to if it would upset relatives?","output":"Masons show up at a Brother’s funeral out of respect for the family and his contributions to his lodge and the community. When a member dies, it is usually the Worshipful Master of the lodge or another member of the lodge he was close to that contacts the family and sees if there is anything they can do to help the family out during that sorrowful time. At that point, they will ask the family if they would like the Masonic lodge to help out with the funeral services and offer a Tribute of Affection to the deceased worthy Brother. Usually that person will have made known whether they would like the Masonic funeral ceremony at their funeral service before passing away. If not, it is the family’s decision as to whether they would like that, and the local lodge and Brother Masons around will show up in white gloves and aprons and perform the ceremony at the appropriate time. If it would upset relatives, the family might decide not to have those services included in the funeral services. If it is the family’s desire to include the services, then those relatives that would be upset have a choice to attend or not. The lodge should never try to persuade or push the services on the family. Not sure why individuals would be upset other than they completely misunderstand Freemasonry and attribute negative connotations to it that if they did a little research would find out that all the anti-Masonic literature out there has been debunked, but continues to be spread around within certain zealot circles. If you are curious about the Masonic funeral services honoring a deceased Brother, contact your local lodge and they will let you read it, then you can decide if it is something you want to include or not. Having performed this many times, the comments from family and friends attending the funeral services really appreciate the compassionate and caring wording of the Tribute of Affection and shows them the aspect of Brotherly Love we have among members."},{"instruction":"w possible is it for a US Army from Afghanistan to send money through a United Nation courier delivery company?","output":"It’s 100% impossible because there is no US army in Afghanistan and there hasn’t been since end August 2021.

It is primarily transmitted from the rabid animal’s saliva when it bites or scratches someone. Licks to wounds or grazed and broken skin, or to the lining of the mouth and nose, can also transmit the disease. WHO, SEA-CD-278, Frequently asked questions on rabies. Rabies has to be introduced into subcutaneous tissue. Whether the individual bleeds or not is not a sure test. (If the person bleeds then the wound must have been subcutaneous, but not the other way around.) I’m a little surprised that the scratch didn’t bleed. On the campus of a university where I once taught, the squirrels were totally fearless. They would come up and take your sandwich away from you if you didn’t pull it away from them. One time a squirrel came up to me, stood on its hind legs, and put its front paws on my hand. I was fascinated to be reacting that closely with a wild animal. However, when I tried to pull my finger away, all of its little tiny claws acted like razor blades and cut through my skin. Maybe I didn’t bleed, but I definitely felt where the wind was hitting the cuts they made. Stupidly, I didn’t even go indoors and hold my hand under running water for fifteen minutes and the finish up with some good antiseptic. Evidently it was a healthy squirrel and/or had clean nails. Since squirrels spend most of their time in trees, they automatically clean their nails by thrusting them deeply into tree bark. So the likelyhood of their licking their toes just before scratching you is pretty small. What brought the squirrel into contact with you. If a squirrel in my home town ever walked up to a person and started making contact with his/her body, then that would almost certainly be a sick squirrel. On the other hand, if you trapped one and then made the mistake of trying to pick it up, the fact that you only got scratched would be an indication of a non-rabid and rather kindly squirrel. Most animals in such a situation would both bite and scratch. I think you should get a second opinion. That way the MD will have all the facts ready at hand, and/or can ask you relevant questions/"},{"instruction":"What makes a Sith trooper a Sith?

This is coming straight from Star Wars Fandom: Sith troopers were elite soldiers in an army raised on the planet Exegol by the Sith Eternal—Sith cultists who revered the dark side of the Force and were devoted to the Sith religion. Though they were not imbued with the power of the Force, Sith troopers nonetheless shared the name of the revived sect of the dark side, drawing inspiration from a dark and ancient legacy. As such, their red armor was reminiscent of Sith lightsaber blades and the Imperial elite, evoking an aura of fear and death. They were the culmination of an elaborate contingency meant to ensure the eternal reign of a new Sith Empire, returning the galaxy to a dark age of a thousand years past.Sith troopers were fanatically loyal to the Sith cause, surpassing their predecessors in allegiance and obedience as a result of methods built upon and advanced beyond the Kaminoan procedures that trained the Republic's clone army.

Both of our kids are very similar to her. There has never ever been a problem with either of them grasping new concepts. Public school was never a challenge.

My son was always building and creating things with whatever was available. My daughter was and is an avid reader. Any subject either one was interested in, they educated themselves to the level of expert. Television was never interesting to either one.

Ireland and the rest of the island provokes a crisis, because it is a violation of the Good Friday accords. The Troubles, part II commence, and N. Ireland is in flames. At some point there is a partition, and the Catholic-majority areas that are adjacent to the Irish Republic are ceded to it. There is a massive transfer of population between those areas and the rump Northern Ireland, every bit as ugly as what happened between India and Pakistan.The SNP calls for a new independence referendum, promising that application for expedited admission of an independent Scotland to the EU would be the first order of business. The referendum passes by an overwhelming majority, and the SNP doesn’t wait for permission from London to declare independence.Somewhere along the way the May government finally loses a no-confidence vote, and there is a new election. By this time most of the voters are furious, most of all toward the pro-Brexit people. They feel they were served up a bunch of lies, and the voters will be determined to make them pay.

The main difference between marble and granite lies in their aesthetic properties. Granite is characterized by a particularly recognizable “speckled” effect and its color is determined by the variation in the percentage of minerals (such as quartz, mica, feldspar, amphibole, etc.) contained in the stone. Marble is formed in the ocean while granite is formed inside the crust of the earth¹³. Even though both granite and marble are hard and can last for several years, there’s one vital difference that makes granite better than marble. That is its non-porous quality. Marble scores 3-5 on the Mohs scale (as it’s a softer sedimentary stone) whereas Granite scores 6 -7 on the Mohs scale due to its extreme density²⁴. I hope that helps.

Don’t do that. The fact that Python is slow is very much exaggerated. Beginners like to argue about which language is faster etc., I did the same thing as well, but you are not writing TensorFlow, you are just trying to implement a simple gradient descent by yourself, the scale of your problem is still far away from reaching the bottleneck of language runtime speed.It’s true that TensorFlow is implemented in C++, as well as many other large scale learning frameworks (e.g. caffe, vowpal wabbit, libsvm) and to best of my knowledge, all optimization routines. However, you’ll notice that most of them have a Python or Matlab wrappers. This means that even if you build everything in Python, under the hood you are still running C++ code, so there really is no performance difference.Remember that your main purpose is to learn about ML, not to practice programming. It would cost you a lot of time to understand the mathimatical concepts in ML alone, coupling that with a language that’s more difficult to deal with will slow you down a lot. And I have to warn you that debugging C++ code for ML algorithms is very difficult. Your brain cycle is much more valuable than CPU cycle, your time is much more expensive than CPU time. So my suggestion is to do one thing at a time. Most online and university courses use Matlab or Python, just pick a course and use whatever language the course uses to implement the algorithms and solve problems. Then if you are ready to focus on some problem where the speed is an important factor, you can dive into C++ and replace some Python code with C++. Edits: Thanks to all the upvotes and comments. I feel like I need to answer some of the very valid comments here, so here we go… Machine learning and data science in general is a huge interdisciplinary area, so different people might have very different opinions. R or Python is more preferred in data analytics or data mining, while C++ is fundamental in deep learning and computer vision. This question is about whether to learn machine learning, and my answer is about that only. If the question is about what language to use in building ML applications, there’s no clear winner, because applications differ vastly. If one is trying to build a robot for example, he/she is basically stuck in ROS/C++/CMake/Linux ecosystem; if the project is to predict sales trends for a company, one might even consider Tableau for convenience.We can do a lot more than using canned libraries in Matlab or Python, in fact, in both languages you can implement a linear SVM or logistic regression without using any library, which is perfect for educational purposes. ML to its core is a set of vector or matrix operations, which is a perfect fit for Matlab and Numpy. If I were to learn ML in C++, I would certainly use Eigen for faster vector operations, the resulting code would be quite similar to Matlab/Numpy code, so why not just use Matlab instead? I don’t hold a grudge on C++, in fact C++ is my native language. It’s just each language has its pros and cons, and it’s more productive to have an open mind and choose the best language for different purposes. It isn't a good idea to claim any language to be useless."},{"instruction":"w do you deliver effective communication?","output":"Never tell them at night unless there is something that they can do and it needs to be done before morning.

When you make a movie out of a book, you can't make it in parts such as Dil Bechara 1, Dil Bechara 2,.. Because you would like to complete a story with climax. Dil Bechara had to be released on online platform so it had to be short. Due to this film maker had to edit it to fit the duration. I have put these details before review as I don't want to be biased just because of movie duration. Movie was full of fun in the first half where Sushant wins our heart with magical acting, comedy and dance and emotions in second half that made me cry twice. I liked the love chemistry and I couldn't take out my eyes off Sushant. I noted even the small small things such as Tshirt that Sushant was wearing. I felt it was Sushant in the character of Sushant. It was fun to watch Jamsedpur and local dialect, especially the Sushant's friend's character. It was lovely and touching. Storyline was also smooth with little suspense. The Bengali family’s conversation were also entertaining. Actress has also done justice to her role and character. A film is as good as its songs are. I was lucky to feel A R Rahman's magic. Songs were beautiful and were inline with the story. The scene that took away my heart - Funeral speech preparation scene in the church. It made my eyes moist. I loved the movie and it finished before I looked at the clock."},{"instruction":"CNN reported that 1,000 US health experts have demanded that businesses not be allowed to reopen, but protestors should not be criticized for violating suggestions and increasing infection risks. Does science not matter anymore?","output":"No. Science no longer matters. For years, the left has called the right anti-science. They've also criticized the right for doubting or being skeptical of “experts” (I quote experts because not all are). There is no greater example that science no longer matters than the letter that just came out this week. The letter’s most telling passage: Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. To the extent possible, we support the application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy. However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States. For four months we were told not to gather, by the experts, in order to flatten the curve. When protesters were demanding to reopen their businesses, we were told these people were dangerous and that they would be responsible for prolonging and exacerbating the problem. Fair enough. Now, a few weeks later, they are dismissing those SCIENTIFIC concerns in the name of SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS. DOESN'T. MAKE. SENSE. Either Covid-19 is a real concern that needs to be properly addressed, or it was never a real concern and it was blown out of proportion. It can't be different depending on politics. So to answer your question: no. Science no longer matters. If you are a business owner, having a birthday or just feel like it, you should feel justified to do whatever you want in large groups.

We had not been to movies for months because of the kids. Our parents visited us. “Both of you go to a movie. We will baby sit the kids” they said. But we decided to go to second show (9pm to 11.30 pm show) and take our son with us. Anyhow it was his sleep time and there will be a problem for parents if he woke up after we went out. He fell asleep as soon as the two wheeler started. He continued his sleep throughout the journey. We could some how get the last two tickets. They were the corner seats in the very first row! Any how since we have come this far we decided to see the movie sitting in those seats.Our toddler was sleeping peacefully through out the advertisements and trailers. Sitting in a corner seat in the first row, the screen looked like this: “Something is better than nothing” we thought. Here I will tell you something. Our toddler used to have constipation. So whenever he completed his #2 we would feel happy. So he decided to give us that happiness just ten minutes after the actual movie started. The happiness was not for once but twice. Each of us took turns to take him out and clean him. He would usually become active after he successfully achieved his #2. But that day he decided to become ‘hyperactive’. The vast space between the first row and the screen made him super excited. He started to run from one end to the other end with all his energy. He even tried to play hide and seek with one or two people sitting in the first row. Initially we tried to run after him but soon we gave up, because nobody complained and they even started enjoying his playfulness. One old man(we were young then) sitting beside husband went into ‘sound’ sleep just after half an hour. The ‘sound’ did not bothered many because it was some what rhythmic and finely mixed with the back ground music of the movie. But I was not very happy with that ‘remix’. Toddler was too curious. He tried to wake the old man up from his slumber but terribly failed. “Shall we go home?” I whispered into husband’s ears. “No we will stay. We have to extract maximum enjoyment(??!!) from the movie” he said. I could only see half the movie, because one of my eyes was on the screen while another was on our toddler. Toddler went into sleep as soon as the scooter started when we were returning!

Therefore statues on private land belong to the land owner and are personal property. Removal without the owner’s permission is theft. Destruction or defacement is vandalism. Both theft and vandalism are punishable by law, both statutory and civil.

Weren’t they supposed to be taken down after the war?","output":"As opponents of the statues will eagerly inform you, most of the Confederate statues didn’t even go up until long after the war and reconstruction, when the ex-Confexerate states were politically in the control of Southern white people, who of necessity accepted being back in the Union, but were nostalgic for their “Lost Cause.” There was no legal bar by then against their putting up statues and other memorials to Confederates. Even in the North, the prevailing view by the late 19th and early 20th century was that the Confederate cause had been misguided but mostly well intentioned, and there was little objection to paying respects to Confederate heroes. In the view of the more fervent present-day opponents of these statues, the Confederate memorials and flag displays were intended not just as nostalgia, but as symbols of an ongoing fight against black civil rights.

The ones that succeed slow Contemplate then Do. And then there are those do not succeed that simply don’t Do anything. By “Do” I am talking about mainly the uncomfortable, difficult, and hard tasks that others are unwilling to do. Those that succeed the fastest are those that act, fully invest into their decision to act, and then learn as much as they can from it. But they jump from experience to experience as quickly as possible, trying out things rather than contemplating about them. Those that still succeed, but at a much slower rate are those that contemplate their decisions first. They take the safer track by figuring out possible results and scenarios and then choose the best option after a while of contemplation. Then, however, they act just as seriously as the ones that succeed the fastest. The people that do not succeed at all, are those often too afraid to act despite having contemplated a lot. They talk themselves out of their decisions, do not stand behind them fully, and waste time entertaining themselves at all times instead. The big thing to note here is that the people that succeed fast, the ones jumping from experience to experience, still think about their choice, but not overly so. They will still gather the information readily available and think about the choice before making it. However, most of these choices will still be made within the hour if not within the day. For them, few choices take longer to commit to than that. Whereas the ones that succeed slowly may take weeks, months, or even years to decide, but they eventually do go through with it. The big thing that sets up those succeeding quickly from the ones that succeed slowly and those again from those that will not succeed at all is the belief in themselves they have. The ones that succeed fast belief they can handle anything. This type of primal confidence often comes with a certain amount of arrogance and pride, which is why most people at the height of their fields are deemed as narcissists or selfish people. The ones that still succeed, but slower, also believe they can handle a lot, but are not willing to test whether or not they can handle anything. They would rather avoid certain situations due to their own disbelief or the fear they have of maybe not being okay with the consequences of their choice and so they hold themselves back. And the ones that do not succeed at all are so terrified of these consequences that they do not step out at all. Which means, in the end, it is all about Self-Belief and Courage. The courage to act and to take responsibility for ones actions, and the overall belief that one can move through these things, whatever they may be, are things that not everybody possesses. But in developing those things one can become less bound, less restricted, less limiting of oneself, which is often the biggest reason for ones own shortcomings and lack of success."},{"instruction":"Social Science","output":"It depends about what you mean by science.

While he was in Congress, for example, he signed the “Contract with America” and voted to impeach Bill Clinton. [LINKED_TEXT: Joe Scarborough - WikipediaAmerican cable news and talk radio host, lawyer, author, and politician (born 1963) Charles Joseph Scarborough ( / ˈ s k ɑːr b ʌr oʊ / ; born April 9, 1963) is an American television host, attorney, political commentator, and former politician who is the co-host of Morning Joe on MSNBC with his wife Mika Brzezinski . He previously hosted Scarborough Country on the same network. A former member of the Republican Party , Scarborough served in the United States House of Representatives for Florida's 1st district from 1995 to 2001. Scarborough was also a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government . [1] He was named in the 2011 Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. [2] Early life and education [ edit ] Scarborough was born in Atlanta in 1963, the son of Mary Joanna ( née Clark) and George Francis Scarborough, a businessman. He has two siblings. [3] In 1969, his family moved to Meridian, Mississippi , and then to Elmira, New York in 1973, and Pensacola, Florida in 1978. [3] Scarborough attended Pensacola Catholic High School in Pensacola. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Alabama in 1985 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Florida College of Law in 1990. [4] During this time, he wrote music and produced CDs with his band, Dixon Mills, including the album Calling on Robert E. Lee , [5] and he also coached football and taught high school. Legal career [ edit ] Scarborough was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1991 [4] and practiced law in Pensacola. [6] Scarborough's most high-profile case was briefly representing Michael F. Griffin , [7] [8] [9] who murdered Dr. David Gunn in 1993. He made several court appearances representing Griffin, before removing himself from the case, [10] later saying: \\"There was no way in hell I could sit in at a civil trial, let alone a capital trial,\\" referring to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty against Griffin. [11] Scarborough assisted Griffin in choosing other counsel from the many who offered their services, however, and helped shield the family from the media exposure, pro bono . [12] [13] Scarborough's political profile was also raised when he assisted with a petition drive , in late-1993, opposing a proposed sixty-five percent increase in Pensacola's property taxes. [6] U.S. House of Representatives [ edit ] Elections [ edit ] Scarborough in 1995 In 1994 , Scarborough was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Florida's 1st congressional district , becoming the first Republican to represent the Florida Panhandle since Reconstruction . The seat had become open when eight-term Democratic incumbent Earl Hutto retired. In the general election, Scarborough defeated the Democratic candidate, Pensacola attorney Vince \\"Vinnie\\" Whibbs Jr., with 61 percent of the vote. Whibbs was the son of former Pensacola mayor Vince Whibbs . This district had not supported a Democratic candidate fhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough]When he was hired by MSNBC in 2003, he toned down his conservatism a bit, but still remained largely critical of Democratic candidates, and only mildly critical of conservatives. His first book in 2005 was critical of Democrats in particular and spending programs in general, and his second book a few years later continued the trend. His third book, in 2013, was still largely a defense of Reagan Republican. Through that period and beyond, the only Republican candidate that Scarborough seemed to consistently disagree with was Donald Trump. Scarborough feels that Trump is dishonest, unstable, unqualified, prejudiced, and selfish. Scarborough feels that the Republican Party is hurting itself by continuing to support Trump. Even though much of what Scarborough said about Trump turned out to be true, Scarborough still does not believe that Trump should be prosecuted.

He is closer to the middle of the road than he used to be, but that seems to be more in the interest of fairness than in pushing one side or the other. Scarborough seems to dislike Trump personally, but that does not seem to be a political issue. I disliked Trump back when he was a Democrat, and still dislike him now. It has little to do with where Trump stands on the issues, it has to do with Trump being a horrible person. Scarborough famously left the Republican Party when they voted for Trump, but is still mostly a conservative. I get the feeling that if Republicans go back to the issues, he will return.

But let me list a few common mistakes I have seen in the past. Not understanding that running is a “long game\\" — If you really want to accomplish something with your running you have to be willing to look out months and years. My first 10 mile race I started training for seven months out, and I probably should have started earlier. I just finished my second Race 13.1 in Baltimore. I had a good run last year, I trained for the last twelve months just to have a better run this year. It takes time, discipline, and perseverance to get better at running.Getting frustrated too easily — Again, it is a long game. You may need to limit your running to 2 miles, 4 times a week, for 3 months before you can increase your time or distance. So be it. Stick with it.Refusing to acknowledge the need for rest — It is better to run less frequently, say 4 days a week and increase mileage per run, than to run more often, 6 days a week, and run fewer miles. This is especially true if you want to be running into your 60s. Let your body rest, or at least the joints you're putting into running.Cross training — On the days your don't run it is important to do other things, yoga, stretching, weights. Building muscle mass is important and running isn't the only thing you should have in your toolkit.Nutrition — I got a big fat F on this one as a young rookie. Just because you run a lot, it doesn't mean you can eat anything you wish. It really doesn't. I eat a very low carb diet, except the day before a half marathon, then I eat carbs, maybe two days before. The rest of the time I eat a lot of protein, fruits, and vegetables. No bread, pasta, pizza, white rice, etc. This is overly simplistic, but point is, nutrition.Understanding how YOUR body works — you have to figure out what works for you and where your true limits reside, then work your goals around those limits. I just finished a half Marathon. Out of 908 runners I was 60th overall, 3rd place in the 50-54 men's group of 50 or so runners. With a pace of 7:27 a mile. But, that's mediocre compared to the truly good runners. I'm going to work to be better but I know my limits and my body. Understand what you're capable of and work to achieve against that.Varying your training — vary your training. Run intervals. Do some speed work. Research some training programs. Read. Try different things. This is essential if you're going to get better over time.Shoes — Shoes are super important. You need to try different types. See what works for you. Hit a store like Road Runner. Have them check your arches and get the custom inserts. It is worth the 80 bucks. Get shoes for training and shoes for racing. And swap your shoes every 500 miles or so. Hope this is helpful. Best of luck."},{"instruction":"Was Iran/Persia powerful before? Was it full of barbarians as mentioned in the movie “300”?

Yet, today there is a sense of economic malaise in the air. The young are feeling frustrated as there are too few good jobs on the horizon for them. Rural areas are in distress as farm incomes have stagnated. Corporate investment has declined. Banks burdened with bad loans are finding it difficult to lend. Exports have declined. There are telltale signs of the onset of a further slowdown. The Government is also showing signs of panic. Soon after witnessing the unease in the corporate sector after her budget speech in July 2019, the Finance Minister started holding consultations with business leaders to assuage their displeasure. The tax surcharge on income of over Rs 2 crore on capital gains of individual and institution investors (domestic and foreign) has been removed; only that on salaries and rent received by individuals remains. Several other measures have been announced: the merger of some public sector banks, recapitalisation, loan melas and moratorium on repayment of micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) loans. All of these, except the last one, are supply side measures and are unlikely to have much of an impact anytime soon on stimulating demand. Will the corrective measures recently taken by the government arrest the slowdown? If they do not, what would? The measure that has received the most media attention is the corporate tax cut. In the third week of September came the announcement that the corporate tax rate would be cut from 30% to 22% for firms that do not seek any exemptions and from 35% to 25% for those who do. For manufacturing firms the tax rate would be as low as 15% for those making investments after October 2019. The news was welcomed by the corporate sector and boosted the Sensex index on the day of the announcement by as much as 4.5%. How did such a state of affairs come to pass in this fast growing country? Will the corrective measures recently taken by the government arrest the slowdown? If they do not, what would? This essay is an attempt to answer these questions by examining the genesis of the present problems and then asks what should be the way forward. The goal is to put together a plausible and coherent story. 1. Development in a Dual Economy Before we start putting together an explanation for the present state of affairs, we should understand the structure of the Indian economy. Let us start by defining the terms ‘formal’ and ‘informal’. The ‘formal’ sector consists of all the registered firms (i.e., firms employing 10 or more employees) plus the government sector. The ‘informal’ sector consists of the rest. Typically, formal sector jobs are better jobs in which the workers get some basic benefits like provident fund, pensions, etc. Informal sector workers do not. Agriculture -- the sector that employees the largest part of Indian labour force (over 40%) -- is informal. Much of the rural economy is informal and so is a part of the urban economy. Eighty percent of India’s population makes their living in the informal sector and produces half of India’s GDP. Almost all the poor toil in the informal sector. Consider India as a dual economy made up of two free trading regions – “Urban” and “Rural”. Urban is more developed and hence the average incomes are higher there. This is so because typically Urban growth is based on productivity growth in the formal sector while Rural growth is based much more on productivity growth in the informal sector (agriculture). Typically, labour productivity and also the potential for productivity growth tends to be higher in the formal sectors like industry than in an informal sector like small-scale agriculture. Faster industrial growth would allow agricultural labour to move to higher productivity jobs in industry, and this can be a significant contributor to the overall growth propelled by productivity growth in each sector. When there are fewer farmers left tilling the same amount of land, they too see an increase in their incomes. There can be a further increase in agricultural incomes through productivity gains in agriculture. When rural incomes rise, they also result in an increased demand for industrial goods, thus producing a virtuous cycle of growth. This is what happened in successful Asian countries. Not only did they grow fast, but they also managed to drastically reduce poverty in a generation. All developed countries have gone through this process. Even large agricultural exporting countries like the United States (US), Canada and Australia have a miniscule percentage of their labour living off agriculture now. The two oft repeated questions: ‘Why is the economy not creating enough good jobs?’ and ‘Why is there such rural distress?’ have a common answer. India has not succeeded in producing enough high productivity jobs to draw labour away from agriculture. Of course, there are further reasons for the present distress in rural areas, demonetisation being an important one. We will discuss these later. If developed countries underwent this process and so did many other Asian countries, why is India taking so long to do this? To understand this let us first understand the strategy employed by the successful Asian countries. 2. A Successful Developmental Strategy Except for the city-states like Hong Kong and Singapore, all the successful Asian countries were primarily agrarian before they industrialised. What they accomplished within 20 years was a total transformation of their economies. Initially, the policymakers concentrated on increasing productivity in agriculture. This directly increased the incomes of the rural population, and, in addition, allowed a higher level of agricultural exports that would, in turn, enable imports of machinery and technology. When a country industrialises in a transformative way, it needs to undertake some major structural reforms. Late-developing countries have the advantage that they can rapidly improve their productivity by transferring technology from developed countries rather than having to invent it themselves. Some of the technology transfer is done through foreign investment and the rest through direct purchase or copying. However, in order to absorb the transferred technology they need a well-trained labour force and supporting infrastructure. Moreover, in order to sustain a high rate of capital formation, they needed to have a high rate of domestic savings. All the Asian success stories paid due diligence to these essential aspects of development. When a country industrialises in a transformative way, it needs to undertake some major structural reforms. In order to facilitate a movement of land and labour to their more productive use, laws pertaining to land and labour may have to be reformed. In order to facilitate savings by households, the financial system needs to be modernised. The financial system should be easily accessible for people no matter where they live and also it should be able to inspire trust. Foreign investors should be assured of legal protection of their intellectual property rights. The success of these Asian countries was based on these basic preliminaries. Another crucial aspect of their development strategy was to start by focusing on producing labour-intensive goods (textiles, footwear, toys, etc.) for the markets in developed countries. They could thus take advantage of their cheap labour and then produce these goods in quantities far in excess of what they could have sold domestically. Thus, domestic demand was never a constraint for them in expanding their industries producing goods in which they had a comparative advantage. There is a certain logic behind this export-led strategy for fast growth. First, when firms can see that there is a potential market for their products they are inclined to make investments. Second, to be able to accumulate capital, a country needs to have a high savings rate; but high savings imply low domestic consumption and hence low domestic demand. However, when a country produces for foreign markets, the trade-off between savings and consumption becomes irrelevant. It can afford to have a high savings rate domestically. With access to export markets, it can have both high domestic savings and high demand coming from consumption abroad. In addition, there is a much greater choice in what to produce as the world demand is bound to be more diverse than domestic demand. The manufacturing sector, especially labour-intensive manufacturing, does not require years of university education to acquire the requisite skills. A high-school graduate or less with some on the job training is often adequate for most of the jobs in manufacturing. Surplus labour from the informal sector, including agriculture, can move into labour-intensive manufacturing with minimum additional training, as long as they have basic skills like literacy and numeracy. This is what happened in Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and China. Lately, even Vietnam and Bangladesh have followed course. Most importantly, as their industrial sector expanded, they absorbed more and more labour from agriculture – a sector with markedly lower productivity. Poverty declined as labour moved to a more productive sector, and the productivity of the remaining agricultural labour also increased. The growth was fast and also inclusive. It is important to mention that their respective governments actively aided this effort to develop a manufacturing sector in select areas with an eye on export markets. This was done through an industrial policy that included low interest loans, land grants, tax holidays and requisite infrastructure like power, container ports and other transportation networks. Albeit, it is easier to do it in countries where the democratic norms are rather flexible. 3. Why has India Failed to Follow the East Asian Script? Unlike the East and Southeast Asian governments, the Indian government did not direct the course of the post-1991 growth. Liberalisation certainly helped unleash market forces but the course of development was determined more or less through serendipity. When the licence raj ended in 1991, a few significant aspects of the reforms determined the subsequent course of the Indian growth story. In 1992, the government monopoly on the communication sector officially ended. The years between 1994 and 1999 saw a great deal of churning in this sector. Gradually, cell phones became pervasive. This was an opportune time for communication technology to take off in India. Due to excessive emphasis on public sector investments since 1960s in high-end technical and managerial institutions like the IITs and IIMs, there was a surplus of highly trained manpower available. At the same time, there was a sudden surge of demand all over the world for IT professionals as the Internet was appearing on the world stage. Indian engineers who were over-skilled for the Indian market had been migrating to the US since the 1960s where they had managed to establish quite a reputation. All this turned out to be fortuitous for Indian firms like TCS, WIPRO and Infosys to emerge on the world stage. Communications and business services grew to be India’s fastest growing sectors from 1993 to 2004 at 20.7% and 24.3% per annum, respectively. Software exports grew at the astronomical rate of 34% per annum over that period [LINKED_TEXT: 1] [URL: https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/what-should-we-do-about-indian-economy#tif-fn1] . [I]nclusive growth in India is a far more difficult prospect for India in 2020 than for China in 2000. India’s fast growth episode was propelled by exports of IT services. It was indeed an export-led growth. However, unlike China’s or South Korea’s growth through manufactured exports that absorbed low-skilled labour in vast numbers, India’s growth episode was led by a high-skilled service sector that failed to adequately absorb unskilled labour from agriculture. In the early 1990s, India could have also developed its manufacturing exports like China and South Korea. But there were several major obstacles: restrictive labour laws that created incentives for keeping the scale small; an outdated land acquisition law that made the process of acquiring land extremely messy; weak infrastructure limiting access to power, ports and roads and, most importantly, a badly educated labour force. Successive governments have found it challenging to address, let alone overcome, these obstacles. India has some unique problems that make any progress on this front difficult. First, any laws pertaining to agriculture and land are in the State List of the Constitution. This means that each state makes its own laws. The Centre can only override them if and only if they are repugnant to a law passed by Parliament. Land is also designated by whether it is agricultural land or not. In order to locate a large industrial project on any land designated as agricultural land, the state government needs to buy it from the farmers and sell it to the industrial house or change the land-use classification of the concerned area. In most states, this is a source of massive corruption and creates incentives for state politicians to block any attempt by the Centre to change these laws. Labour laws are in the Concurrent List of the Constitution. This means that the residual powers remain with the Centre, and the Central Government has greater degrees of freedom to change the laws. Yet, successive governments have found it politically difficult to do so. Rajasthan made some changes under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government, but these changes were marginal. The existing laws are set up so as to put more restrictions on larger employers, especially with regard to adjusting the work force in response to changes in demand. This discourages attaining scales that would allow Indian manufacturers to compete internationally. These laws can be endured in situations where demand does not move cyclically, which was the case in India for many years in the past. However, international markets are notoriously cyclical, and firms need to adjust their output with a fair degree of flexibility. More importantly, since the mid-1990s, the Indian economy too has been displaying distinct business cycle behaviour, which makes the impact of these laws even more damaging. In fact, this could be an important factor driving the process of automation and robotics in Indian industry. After China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999, it went on to occupy most of the unfilled space in the developed countries’ markets for manufactured goods. “Made in China” became a universal brand. It became much more difficult for countries like India to compete with China after that. In addition, the climate for international trade has recently changed. Developed countries have witnessed a denuding of their manufacturing sectors and the widespread resentment due to it has led to the election of right wing nationalists like Donald Trump. Countries such as the US are not so receptive any more to importing cheaper goods from low wage countries. Moreover, Indian workers now have to compete not just with Chinese and Vietnamese workers but also with robots and artificial intelligence. Even in India, firms have strong incentives to make production more capital-intensive. This is not just because of labour laws but also because long-term interest rates are not that much higher than short-term interest rates. The long and short of this is that inclusive growth in India is a far more difficult prospect for India in 2020 than for China in 2000. Yet, we must ask how other democratic nations like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia have managed to solve these problems. Especially the problem of skilling the labour force. Even Bangladesh managed to develop a strong textile sector that could compete in international markets. When primary and secondary education itself fails to impart basic literacy and numeracy, any subsequent skilling programme is bound to fail. Why has public education been such a challenge for India? The genesis of India’s present problems of a lack of job creation and rural distress lies in these factors. Why did the growth of domestic investment and consequently the rate of gross capital formation slow down after 2008? It is important to note that the Asian success stories including that of China were based on an extremely high rate of investment. You need investment to create jobs and wages by bringing in new technology as well as by adding more capital (machines). India’s investment rate has not been bad at all, compared to the other Asian countries, except China. But it has faltered of late, particularly post the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.

Braverman is a human turd, while Johnson is a walking sewage farm"},{"instruction":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","output":"If you have to ask the question, that is an indication you need to hire someone else. The decision on an individual repair or improvement depends on your skills, qualifications and building codes. If code requires a licensed contractor (which is only HVAC, electrical and plumbing in Texas and NOTHING ELSE) then if you need repairs in one of those specialty fields and are not licensed you would be a fool to fix it yourself due to liability issues if a mistake on your part were to cause physical damage to a tenant. If it’s something like a leaking pipe, it generally does not require a license to repair/replace that so you can do that yourself. If the repair is not something in a specialty that requires licensing then the question remains whether you have the skills, tools, time and how rapidly the item needs repaired for the safety of the tenant. If you have the skills, tools, time and can get to it timely - then go ahead. If you don’t, hire someone to get the repair fixed in a timely manner. Remember your tenant is your customer and they judge you as a landlord on whether you keep their unit maintained and how rapidly you get their problems resolved. That may make a difference on lease renewals and when you increase the rent on whether they choose to stay or leave."},{"instruction":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","output":"I'm infact baffled by the thought that this question is being circulating on quora since the release of the movie.

But it doesn’t change the fact that she has character flaws like most of the others do. She typically makes rushed descions and is quick to anger. The writers make it a habit to show this side of her because she’s a Targaryen and it fits their personality.

How so? Would it be as bad as what happened at Chernobyl in 1986? That wasn’t a meltdown due to failure to remove enough decay heat after shutting down the reactor like TMI and Fukushima. It was much worse. Granted, there was a mass of liquid flaming mess left in the remains of the reactor after the explosion. The red hot glowing fire could not be put out for 10 days. I am still not sure how to properly describe the explosion. It was not really a nuclear explosion, not even like the Hiroshima bomb. Nor was it as big as a “fizzle” would be. It was the equivalent of “only” about 60 tons of TNT. Nuclear bomb blast size is given in kilotons, thousands of tons of TNT. Also, the reactor was not shut down, but in the process of a generator test - undertaken under clearly forbidden circumstances. The reactor was unstable and behaving erratically, so the operators tried to shut the reactor down. Inserting the control rods had the opposite to the desired action. The indicators for the position of the control rods showed that they stopped at about 1/2 way in. Only one of the 4 men that went up to the top of the reactor with the mission to push the control rods the rest of the way in manually if they had to, survived. He was left to hold the door open for the return of the three that went through that last door to get to the control rods. The control rods and the top of the reactor just weren’t there anymore. Between the moderating water being displaced from the channels for the control rods and the fact that the tips of the control rods actually increased rate of the fission reactions, The surge in energy (heat) flashed the water in the reactor to steam in less than 2 seconds. Some call that a steam explosion but I think that term is far too mild. We do not have a word for what happened. The good news is that we do not need a word for it because nobody is stupid enough to make so many of those same mistakes again. Not even … you know who. Chernobyl was a truly horrible radiological “incident”, probably even worse than a small scale nuclear war between, say, Pakistan and India. Nuclear wars are not expected to last a whole 10 days like the open to the sky nuclear fire at Chernobyl. Yet the deaths from radiation were less than 100. So, where does your idea of a complete nuclear meltdown fit into this picture? I am only about 1/2 way through this book and I do have some reservations about the author’s knowledge about the health effects of radiation, but I recommend reading it, and thinking about it, anyway.

I have a large yard and my Shepherd is happy to play fetch and run around the yard to get most of their exercise. The Husky does not enjoy it at all. She enjoys tracking small animals, aggressively attacking the much larger Shepherd (play fighting, unless he starts to get the upper hand, then she actually turn off play mode and get serious, because she is an Alpha), and looking for ways to escape the yard. She will constantly check and recheck spots along the fence line looking for weak points, and she could dig under it very quickly if she wanted. They just want to run full speed non-stop for hours. It’s part of their soul. She will run straight into traffic with no concerns. It’s only happened about 3 times, and it’s the most scared I have ever been in my life. I know that as long as she lives, she can never be trusted off leash outside of a securely fenced area with 6 foot+ fencing. She can never be trusted alone for more than a few seconds at a time even in my fenced yard because digging and climbing are things they can do. I know I will never eat another meal at home that doesn’t have fur in it. It’s just normal. They are hard. There are too many of them sadly and not enough suitable homes.

Many people follow celebrities and movies, There are numerous Kannadigas in the other film industries and they are not proud as Kannadiga or I don't know the real reason why they are ashamed of representing themselves as Kannadiga.

It is one of the “Jeeva Brahma Ikya Bodhaka vaakyas.” It means, the sentence which teaches the oneness of individual Soul and Universal soul. There are four such Vedic Mahavaakyas in total. They are :- Prajnaanam Brahma. It means”Consciousness is Brahma.” This is from ‘Aitareya Upanishad’ and it belongs to Rigveda. Aham Brahma Asmi: It means “I am Brahma.” This is from Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad and this belongs to Yajurveda. Tat Tvam Asi. This is from Chaandogya Upanishad and this belongs to Saamaveda. Ayam Atmaa Brahma. This is from Mandukya Upanishad and belongs to Atharva veda. There are many intermediary sentences apart from these four major sentences. They are called ‘Avaantara Vaakyas’. Let us understand the nature of these four sentences. The first one is of the nature of a definition. It is called ‘Lakshana vaakya’. The sentence defines Brahma. The second is Anusandhana vaakya. It is of the nature of Self-Inquiry. The sadahaka/striver is asked to conduct a research into the his own inner Self/Nature. The third axiom is called a Upadesha vaakya. It is of the nature of instruction to student by a realized preceptor. The fourth axiom is called ‘Anubhava vaakya’. It is the utterance the of student who experiences Brahma following the instructions of the preceptor. AHAM BRAHMA ASMI; This sentence contains three words. The sanskrit word Aham means I. Brahman is the name given to the impersonal God. Asmi means am. Thus the sentence “Aham Brahma asmi means “I am Brahman.” The word Brahman is defined as Satyam/Truth, Jnanam/Knowledge Anantam/Eternity and also, as Anandam/Bliss. It means Brahman/God is the ”Infinite Ocean of Existence, Consciousness and Bliss.” Aham refers to Individual Soul. Brahman refers to Supreme Consciousness/Absolute Reality/God. Asmi is verb which corroborates the two. Thus it means the Individual soul is verily the Supreme Soul/Over Soul/Universal Soul/God. Equating the finite with Infinite may appear strange and unbelievable. But we should remember that there will be primary and, indicatory meanings to words. There fore let’s try to understand this. Consciousness and matter are inseparable. Consciousness is all pervading and all permeating. It is Consciousness appearing through matter in different forms. Like mud pervades the entire pot, gold pervades the entire ornament, similarly the Brahman/ Supreme Consciousness/God pervades and permeates the entire universe. Pot and ornaments are just adjuncts and in reality, they are nothing but, mud and gold. Thus, it is one Supreme Consciousness/God/Brahman in various names and forms. Multiplicity is due to adjuncts. When one removes the adjuncts, only the Brahman/God/ The Absolute Truth remains. Eg: Suppose there are hundreds of urns filled with water kept in sun, the sun appears in all those urns. It does not make hundred suns. It is one and the only sun in all urns. The all pervading space appears divided in various things like buildings, pot, urn, barn, needle etc. This is just an appearance and the truth is, all these different things are in one infinite space. The waves, foam, whirl, bubble etc are in reality water and only water; but appear different. So also, the infinite appearances in this universe are an expression of one Undivided, Infinite, Supreme Consciousness. The very moment the king discards the kingdom and the soldier his shield, there is neither a king nor a soldier. They are just humans! Similarly if we remove the adjuncts of physical body, the subtle body comprising of mind, intellect, ego and memories; the causal body comprising of the three attributes; what remains is our Real Nature, the Inner Soul, the Individual Consciousness. This is Ultimate Truth. Ultimate Truth is Absolute, Transcendental. It is direct and of immediate experience. It is unlike the experience of the world, which we get through senses. Only transcending the senses, we can experience Absolute Truth. The experience through senses is physical, phenomenal. Many a times, we take unreal to be real. There will be many occasions when we mistake a rope for a snake and perspire, mistake a mirage for water and run towards it, mistake a stump to be some person in dull light and get suspicious about that non-existent person. We experience real trauma for nothing. This is called Illusory Reality. Proper discernment help us to stride over this. After discernment, we will not see the illusory object which we had seen earlier. Like the Illusory Reality can be got rid off with proper discernment, the physical reality of the universe also can be done away with, even when are alive, provided we realize Absolute Truth. For realizing the Absolute Truth, we should understand the nature of our Individual Self, the nature of universe, the nature of universal Self and the relation between these. To safeguard from self-deceptions, the three criteria for Truth are laid down. They are Shruti or Studying scriptures in-depth, Yukti or reasoning and Anubhava or experience. When all these three point to the same conclusion, then the aspirant can conclude that he has realized the Truth. Conceptual knowledge should be transformed into experiential knowledge, to always remain in Bliss. The aspirant should conduct an inquiry into Self employing vedantic methods, of Adhyaaropa or Adhyaasa and, Apavada. Adhyasa:The characteristics of Self are superimposed on Non-Self. Self means Infinite, Eternal Consciousness which is of the nature of Bliss. It is ever pure i.e. without objective reality. It is beyond the unity of time, space and causation. This Consciousness itself appears as a phenomenal entity. The phenomenal entity is subjected to six changes [existence in womb, taking birth, growth, attaining maturity, deterioration and ultimately death]. It is subjected to hunger and thirst etc. but not the Consciousness. Consciousness is that unchanging witness to all the bodily experiences. Non-Self means body with its twenty four constituents[5 objects of sense perceptions like sound, touch, form, taste and smell+5 fundamentals of sky, air, fire, water, earth +5sense organs+5organs of actions,+mind+intellect+ego+memories] Apavada: There is total disconnect between Self and Non-Self. Through discernment the erroneously superimposed attributes can be negated. When erroneous superimposition is removed, what remains, is Absolute Reality. The following methods can be employed to remove Superimposition and to arrive at Truth. Drik-Drishya Viveka/The seer and seen method: The seer, the experiencer is certainly different from the seen/object. When the attributes of subject are associated with object, it is called superimposition. Seer is ‘one constant’ and seen are many and varied. The experiencer is one constant and the experiences are many and varied. The body can be seen and experienced. Therefore we are not body; but, the Witness Consciousness to our body and to its experiences. The senses through which we experience become the objects of experiences themselves when we say, ‘my eyes are dull’, ‘my ears are going deaf’ etc.. Here also, we are the Witness Consciousness to these experiences of dullness deafness etc. The intellect sometimes discerns the things accurately, and sometimes, it fails to do so. Intellect is subjected to likes and dislikes. We can experience the dullness, the keenness of our Intellect. Therefore, we are other than Intellect We are the Witness to these Intellectual experiences. The experiencer and experienced can not be one and the same. We can experience our body, senses, mind and intellect. Therefore, we are not those. We are in reality, the Witness Consciousness to all these experiences. Panchakosha Viveka. The discernment through five sheaths. The individual soul is covered with five sheaths. They are physical/Annamaya Kosha, Pranic/the sheath of vital airs, Manomaya Kosha/the sheath of mind, the Vijnana Maya Kosha/the sheath of intellect, Anandamaya kosha/the sheath of happiness. Consciousness is pure like crystal. It reflects that, near it. Consciousness reflects all the five sheaths mentioned above. We can experience these sheaths with the help of Consciousness. Therefore we are not the sheaths, but Witness Consciousness. Avasthaatraya Kosha/The three states of Experiences: The three states of experiences are: Waking State: Here we experience the world through our senses. The Inner Light/Consciousness reflects on the four internals/mind and its constituents [technically called ‘Chidaakaasha’] and through that, it reflects to sense organs and through our senses we experience the world. Consciousness serves as the unchanging substratum/Witness to all our experiences. Dream State:-In dream state, the physical body disappears. We can experience our subtle body. The mind creates its own world and reigns. Again the unchanging Witness Consciousness is the substratum to the dream experiences. In our dream lying at 180 degrees we go to moon, roam freely interact with so many characters who are not physically there. It is the mind, the reflected consciousness which assumes forms! This is a proof that it is the Consciousness which assumes forms! This is also a proof that even the Individual Consciousness is not bound by the unity of time, space and causation. Sushupti/Deep Sleep Experience: In this state even the mind/subtle body disappears. We experience nothingness. We experience blissful sleep. Where will be the Individual Consciousness then? It will be very much there, as Unchanging,Constant Witness to our experience of ‘Absence’. This is evident when we get up we say, I had an absolutely blissful sleep unaware of the world. It is an experience of ‘Absence’. Thus we can conclude that we are neither physical body, nor subtle body, nor causal body. We are that Unchanging Witness Consciousness. Consciousness is Infinite. It can never be divided. Brahman/God is Infinite. Thus whether it is Individual Consciousness/Self or Universal Consciousness/Absolute Reality/God it is one and the same. Thus it is, “I AM BRAHMAN.” All our sufferings are due to the nescience that I am this body, with this type of mind and with this intellect. The body, mind and intellect gives us our personality. We are all trapped in our personalities and ignoring our One Divinity. All the miseries, all the conflicts, all the negativeness absolutely dissolve when we discover our true identity. We are one Divinity in various personalities."},{"instruction":"What are the best baby skin care products?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Beauty tips] [URL: https://mysportbeauty.xyz/page_beauty.php?id=22] Which Products Are Best For Your Baby?"},{"instruction":"What is it like raising a very high IQ child?","output":"It is hard, because every parent wants to have a special kid. Therefore nobody will belive until they realize it by them self. You have to fight for it constantly. For instance when they are 6, some social behaviours are not yet developed. People have difficulties to understand that a kid who reads thick books can at the same time be 6 year old kids who is afraid of the dark and needs mom or dad to go to kindergarden. Or empathy is not yet developed. When they enter school they start learning A for a week then B and so on. This drives them absolutely nuts because thats what they did with 2, by them self. But the teachers only sees that the handwriting is bad, so he has to write A for weeks. If nothing happends and the kid gets no brain food it will start to behave accordingly. There is a video from vsauce which shows that boredom is worse than pain for humans. So if you don‘t fight at this time it would probably get some drugs. There is also the problem that in such schools they don‘t learn to do difficult stuff. So they don‘t learn to put extra effort into something. Eventually they give up if they cannot solve a problem imideately. They have never had to learn they only had to think. They don‘t learn to break down a problem, because the school problems are always obvious to them Thats school. At home is challenging too, they need constant brain food. They constantly talk and constantly challege your decision and mostly they are right :). You have to take care that you don‘t fall into the trap, that you say: common you are clever, you can do this.

HOWEVER, Speaker Pelosi must be re-elected in 2020 and, as dictated by the Constitution (Article I, Section 2), and sworn in on January 3 to retain that position. Were the 2020 general election theoretically delayed; she would not yet be re-elected and would therefore no longer be a sworn in member of Congress. Ergo, she would no longer be Speaker of the House. In fact, the House of Representatives would be devoid of all 435 members; as would one-third of US Senatorial seats be vacant. If no one in the Senate were up for re-election, #3 in the line of succession, the president pro tempore of the United States Senate (Chuck Grassley, R-IA) becomes president. Grassley is not up for re-election in the upcoming 2020 election.

To my knowledge, no vaccine has been shown to have any link to autism. Tell her to contact her family doctor or another reputable professional medical practitioner for proper advice. How did this begin? In 1998, an unscrupulous doctor by the name of Andrew Wakefield managed to have his very poorly done and downright fraudulent “study” linking childhood immunizations to autism published in the medical journal, Lancet. The study raised a firestorm of controversy garnering him much attention and the adulation of worried people who were not literate in science. The medical community dove straight into this earth shaking claim and attempted to reproduce his results. No one could. It was all an artifice and the paper was withdrawn by the journal some years later. But by then, the damage had been done.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Since I have watched so much video, I must be a genius on the issue. Certainly I'll help. I'll define along lines of some ballistic concepts important for public grasp of knowing about guns, specifically, today. magazine - bumpstock-enabling ammo delivery device aka clip. A magazine serves as generic reference for any gun's optional supply of ammunition. Operator could place one single cartridge manually into loading chamber, but a magazine places cartridges there automatically once prior cartridge has been cleared, utilizing spring-pressure. So, instead of replacing each single bullet, your operator would replace gun's entire magazine. clip - No gun can fire if a truly empty cartridge remains in its loading chamber after chamber of gun becomes cleared. Spring action delivers bullet inside magazine into loading chamber. Bullet activates by release of hammer. Cocking trigger coils hammer away from bullet, and pressing trigger releases coiled hammer to deliver severe physical blow (think ‘sledgehammer') to cartridge end. Physical force of resulting collision sends high heat into cartridge end directly to gunpowder. Gunpowder explodes with hyperpropulsive force that causes unclasping of bullet in a single burst, and entirety of ballistic action confers to bullet deadly hole-punch action in unopposed direction. If ballistic bullet hits solid target, it can either penetrate or ricochet. assault weapons - the only thing that distinguishes assault weapons from “ordinary firearms of earlier history” would be capacity to deliver multiple shots without reloading. In other words, it has a magazine, clip, or ammunition-belt mechanism. automatic weapon - any assault weapon that still holds more than 10 projectiles. semi-automatic weapon - any assault weapon that can't fire more than 10 shots without reloading (i.e., replacing the clip.or magazine), although some consider revolvers to be in this category. firearms - any hand-operated, portable weapon capable of delivering only a minimal amount of ballistic action. Usually these weapons will be capable of delivering one or two shots before reloading, although you do have revolvers. lesser ballistic weapons - air rifles, pellet guns, & BB guns that can only inflict limited damage to property and usually not be likely to kill human targets outright; although may be of severe, permanent consequence in terms of maiming certain human organs. BB guns can hold perhaps a hundred BBs in their spring cartridge, and its spring tension serves as basis for strength of BB delivery. BBs embed in eyes too well; if you love animals, there can be better options. manual ballistic weapons - weapons such as stones, bladed-stars or throwing knives that can be deadly by accident but usually require skilled expertise to deliver in event of any retaliatory prompting. Caltrops can also be used as a passive manual ballistic weapon; think of caltrops as resembling toy jax but with exaggerated, sharpened piercing projections. Caltrops can slow non-careful attackers down or impale their feet. Everything else gun-related is not much more than a make and/or model of a gun, such as AR, Uzi, AK-47, Kalashnikov. And then you also have specific makes and models that a certain type of militant individual might use, such as a skilled sniper. These may be tagged “sniper rifles,” but a gun's a gun … until you want to sell it or own it. toy ballistic weapons - devices designed to imitate ballistic weapon actions with main intention to be simply to get their operator used to basic dynamics of manual coordination skills under implicit notion that real weapons will be heavier and more encumbering but outright lethal. These imitative devices have been designed to let kids have fun together or apart as only the modicum of adult guidance can orient. Other ballistic delivery devices may be relevant, such as grenade launchers and rocket launchers. A rail gun, although most impressive …not so much. I have left out cannons and catapults; these are not too relevant. safety - you have got to be kidding. But this refers to a mechanism, often called a “safety,\\" that can be put into.one of two mechanical.positions. When ON, the gun supposedly can't fire (when in well-maintained); and when OFF, the gun wants to fire if but it can move. scope - a gun can often be fitted with a scope, which magnifies a target and sometimes offers marked graduations for stylizing reference. Instead of looking at the wing tip at end of a gun to sight, the scope offers magnifying lens to assist. Hunters and snipers at times use scopes for completing distance shots more reliably than visual limitations may. barrel - part of gun that both surrounds loading chamber and that bullet tracks on its way out from its explosion. butt end - part of gun used to handle brunt of recoil, called grip on handgun. … Remember that guns are not unusually harmful, but that their projectiles range from wax or rubber bullets to deadly schrapnel. The logical concern should always be about the sort of bullet or projectile that could be loaded in its chamber or magazine. The projectile carries the greater threat, although if taking a gun away from an attacker, remaining bullets can still be thrown like fuseless fireworks and be every bit as threatening as fired bullets without the gun, if an attacker were fool enough to try this. At the same time, enough heat directed in a precision laser beam can trigger every bullet in sight. So, the reader would do well to modernize well and good over the glam of yesterday's bandolier, if planning to use ammo in any practical, surefire capacity. The safety of firearm utilization has diminished yet further in recent times, despite a lack of fools trying to wedge specific misuse fatality escapades into print & video at the same times."},{"instruction":"w do I know if I don’t believe in God?","output":"If you don’t believe, then you don’t believe.

Stocks have the potential for high returns, but they also come with higher volatility and risk. Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They are generally considered lower risk than stocks and provide regular interest payments. They can be a good option for more conservative investors. Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They provide instant diversification and professional management. Index Funds: Index funds track a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer broad market exposure and tend to have lower fees compared to actively managed funds. Real Estate: Real estate investing involves buying properties for rental income or capital appreciation. It can provide a steady income stream and potential tax benefits. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks on an exchange. They offer diversification and can be a cost-effective way to invest in various asset classes. Retirement Accounts: Contributing to retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs offers tax advantages and helps you save for your future. These accounts often include a variety of investment options. Diversification: Diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) can help reduce risk. Different assets may perform well at different times, providing a cushion against losses. Dividend Stocks: Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, providing a regular income stream. Dividend stocks can be attractive for income-focused investors. Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to lend money to individuals or small businesses in exchange for interest payments. This can provide higher yields but comes with lending risk. Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained popularity as alternative investments. However, they are highly speculative and come with significant volatility. Robo-Advisors: Robo-advisors are automated platforms that create and manage investment portfolios based on your risk tolerance and goals. They can be a convenient option for beginners. Education: Invest in yourself by acquiring new skills or education that can lead to higher earning potential in the future. It's important to note that all investments carry some level of risk. Before investing, consider your financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Diversification and a long-term perspective are often key to successful investing. If you're unsure about investing, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor or conducting thorough research before making any decisions.

These degrees generally take 5-6 years to complete and require students to pass a comprehensive exam and defend a dissertation in order to graduate"},{"instruction":"When should we allow for overdispersion in Poisson regression models?","output":"Pretty much always, if you’re working in the social sciences. It’s rare in social science for the conditional mean of your data to be equal to the conditional variance, probably because social phenomena rarely satisfy the assumptions of the Poisson distribution—that is, the rate of occurrence is constant (at least within the population or slice of time that you’re interested in) and the occurrence of an event at one point in time doesn’t affect the probability of a second occurrence at any later point in time. In particular, what often happens is that the data are overdispersed—the variance, conditional on covariates, is greater than the mean (which is equal to the variance for a Poisson distribution). This could be because the right tail of the distribution is longer than you’d expect for a Poisson random variable, or (more commonly) you have a lot more zero values than you’d expect. If you don’t account for this, then your standard errors are going to be wrong—specifically, they’ll be biased downward, which means that your confidence intervals will be too narrow and your hypothesis tests not conservative enough: you’ll reject too many null hypotheses and conclude too many relationships than are statistically warranted. In the general overdispersion case you can address this problem by fitting either a quasi-Poisson or negative binomial regression model. Both models allow the variance to differ from the mean, although the quasi-Poisson does this by modeling the variance as a constant multiple of the mean, while the negative binomial does it by modeling the variance as equal to the mean plus a constant multiple of the square of the mean. In either case you estimate a single additional (over)dispersion parameter. There are then statistical tests you can use to test whether the amount of overdispersion is large enough to warrant estimating that additional parameter, but simply eyeballing the overdispersion parameter, which is an output of the model, will tell you how overdispersed your data are: Poisson model Call: glm(formula = art ~ . + I(ment^2), family = poisson, data = articles) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.7483 -1.4570 -0.3149 0.5821 5.3085 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Since all the coefficient estimates are the same, the effect is to increase our [math]p[/math]-values, and in this case it pushes the estimate of the coefficient on marital status into insignificance if you’re using a threshold of [math]alpha=0.05[/math]. There’s a special case of overdispersion in which there are a lot more zero values in the outcome variable than you’d expect; this can happen, for example, when there’s a subset of the population that isn’t at risk of having the event happen to them at all. The example dataset I used above is a sample of Ph.D. biochemists, and the outcome of interest was the number of articles they published; you might suspect zero-inflation because a subset of the population doesn’t intend to go into academia, and so might not bother to publish anything. The zero-inflated model that you can estimate is really a mixture of two models: one is a model (often logistic regression) for whether an individual is at risk of the event at all (i.e. it predicts [math]P(P(Y>0)>0)[/math]) and the other is an ordinary Poisson model that predicts the expected value of the outcome, given that an individual is at risk.

I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","output":"It is a myth that assembler is faster, or that C and C++ are fast. Languages are not fast in themselves. They must be implemented. The implementation of a language in its code generator determines the performance. In assembler, the code generator IS the programmer. Most often advanced knowledge of any platform performance is built into code generators and optimisers. That will be way in advance of even the best of programmers, who just don’t have time to profile performance of a individual instructions or the combination of groups of instructions (they can impact the pipeline). Compiled languages will mostly get very good performance. It is simply not worth the effort to write any assembler, except for machine functions that are not accessible otherwise. But most of those should not be used in any programs apart from the lowest level of operating systems and drivers. Even then we don’t need assembler, if we design appropriate languages. [LINKED_TEXT: Ian Joyner · 1yCan C access the hardware as deep as Assembly?No. While you can directly access memory with primitive pointers, and then dress it up a little with primitive macros to make extensions that should be in a hardware-oriented language, processors can have instructions that can’t be generated from the source language. Some compilers have inline for assembler instructions. Often such instructions are security sensitive and should not be available to most programs, only in the core of an OS. Thus C has a dangerous mix of no you can’t and yes you can with primitive lowest-common-denominator programming. In multiprogrammed systems, deep access must be strictly controlled. C gives primitive ways to get around that. It might be very powerful — for hackers! But that is weak for security. For special-purpose non-multiprogrammed systems, more sophisticated and controlled ways of building such memory access and instruction generation is possible in better hardware-oriented languages. This would require vendors to think about how their platform is programmed and how to make platforms secure. Many special-purpose network devices (IoT) are not designed with software in mind. C is provides primitive mechanisms so that programmers can ‘roll-their-own’ for any purpose, but that has two problems — first it is not real support for programming at any level, and secondly it is very weak on security which is one of the most pressing problems in today’s computing environment. Brian Krebs — krebsonsecurity.com from CyberWar Episode 2-5 “Hardware makers are just pushing out hardware and letting somebody else design the software. They tend to have ver very poorly written software powering these devices.” C just enables and exacerbates this bad situation. We must also be careful about software installed from other platforms which might have been cross-compiled with malicious code. What should vendors do to integrate hardware and the way it is programmed? This answer will explain how to go from the primitive yet weak mechanisms of C to secure, yet lower-level programming that is more sophisticated and yet protects programs from small changes in software.] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Can-C-access-the-hardware-as-deep-as-Assembly/answer/Ian-Joyner-1]"},{"instruction":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","output":"The team leads driving the inside sales team must prioritize the choice of products based on the needs and wants.

During Mueller's testimony he did manage to shed light on two issues. His team investigated the Trump tower meeting but did not investigate the Russian Lawyer that initiated the meeting and who met with Glen Simpson before and after the meeting, because it was “outside the preview of the investigation. (Like taxicab medallions were in the purview?) A full investigation would have suggested the meeting was an attempt to set up Trump. He failed to investigate the bogus Steele Dossier that was the basis of his investigation. This and actions by the FBI to set up Carter Page were once again outside his purview. The report does not present any exculpatory evidence, something a prosecutor would be required to do in an actual legal proceeding. There is nothing objective about the Mueller investigation. They only investigated things that were bad for Trump. Early on, after less than a year, they could not find evidence of collusion so they shifted to investigation on pure obstruction, beginning with motivation for the firing of Corey. They drug the investigation out, mistreated associates of Trump, threatened to go after his family, and waited for acts they could characterize as obstruction. This is definitely a one sided witch hunt and there was no effort to be complete, thorough, or objective."},{"instruction":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","output":"More often than not, a sales team relies a lot on phone call sales. A huge chunk of customer interaction that happens in any kind of industry happens over the phone (over 90% of it, in fact!), and that usually comes from seeing an ad online or from a specific website. Knowing that and identifying what caused the call to happen is immensely powerful in boosting a sales team productivity. By tracking the nature of these calls, a team is empowered to focus on a certain marketing or sales campaign, boosting their productivity. Aloware is a great way to set up your team with better productivity. By identifying what caused the call, you immediately start focusing on data that can help you drive more calls and generate more revenue. It’s this kind of statistical and behavioral accuracy that turns sales into a science to help you convert sales into actual revenue for your team. A great feature for this call tracking software are the actionable reports, which gives you no-fuss graphical representations of the source of inbound calls that need to be tracked and where they came from. Speaking of productivity, DNI technology helps with Aloware integration. Simply insert a one-line snippet into your website, and you should be good to go with tracking! These are all very important data to be analyzed, but your sales team activity is also a major point for any business. Aloware fully supports that too, and looks at your teams performance and provides information pertinent to that.

Doctors won’t just endlessly order pointless tests for people who are being paranoid about nothing and have no symptoms. Private medicine does also exist in the UK, however. So if you’re looking for a doctor who is working for profit (i.e. the more tests / treatments / prescriptions / whatever he orders, the more money he makes. . . and therefore he’s strongly motivated to do pointless stuff), there are plenty of them available and you’re free to find one (without forfeiting your right to free treatment on the NHS).

What you don’t know is whether your son is thoroughly bored and his behavior is resulting from not being challenged in class or if the teacher is not presenting material as he needs for his learning abilities, or if he is having other issues such as seeking attention or behaviorally disrespectful/belligerent. Let your son know that you will not tolerate his behavior and repeated infractions at school and that if he can’t behave you will come sit next to him every day until he can demonstrate his independence and maturity enough to attend school on his own and follow the rules. My friend did this, she was a single mom with multiple kids working nights, she spent a week sitting behind her son observing what was going on. The problem was resolved, in part because of his embarrassment of having mom there, and because he knew he was not going to get away with this. He was also not being challenged, they had him assessed and provided him harder assignments and more responsibilities to fill his time. He excelled once he was actively learning and participating and saw the value in what he was doing. Nip this behavior issue in the bud, make him understand he will have to respect his peers and teachers and follow the rules, there is no getting out of this by misbehaving. Good luck."},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"Are you tired of your 9 to 5 job and dream of financial freedom?

You see, in my family I'm known to be one of the smartest teenagers, going to one of the best high schools in Illinois and whatnot. I have 3 siblings, one older sister, one older brother, and one younger sister. Of the 4 of us, my parents had the hardest time raising me and my older sister. When I was around 5, I had too many questions to ask my parents about how the world functioned. I asked them things that they would never know, and when they didn't know I would ask one of my preschool teachers and try to find answers to every question I had. Sure, it's normal for children to ask questions like that, but my questions were somewhat sophisticated for a 5 year old. I asked questions about our religion, our way of learning, and even questions regarding politics. My mother and father are both amazing people, they didn't differentiate me from my siblings (mind you, I had Asthma at the time too, and at some points I even asked how my inhaler worked). When I asked questions my parents would attempt to come up with the most reasonable answers. When I was 7, I began asking them questions that I already knew the answer to just to see what they knew and didn't know. It turns out that my parents didn't have the best education in Mexico. My parents are legal immigrants from Mexico, and did not have the best education that one could get in Mexico. They came to the US at a fairly young age, just in time for me to be their first child born in the US. Eventually I started kindergarten in the South side of Chicago, but my family moved to a nearby suburb around December of 2009, and we have lived here since 2010. When I began kindergarten I began to learn English, but I never learned English as quickly as my peers. It was difficult to comprehend the language at first, and I was behind in my kindergarten class. I was the only one that fell behind. When my 2nd kindergarten teacher realized I didn't know much English, she let her superior know. Not much later, I was moved to a bilingual class with students that had as much knowledge in the English language as me. I fell behind in that class too. I was very shy and didn't have many friends, and because of my lack of participation I fell behind. I did not want to ask questions to people I did not know. I didn't even ask my older siblings due to the fact that my father strictly enforced the notion that we only speak Spanish at home now that we were learning English at school. That has turned out to be a smart move because not a lot of Hispanic people know how to properly write in Spanish, and my whole family is able to because of my dad. Eventually, I began to get comfortable and asked so many questions in 1st grade. I began to catch up with my English. Now, when I began to learn English, my parents were proud of me for beginning to catch up with school and the given currículum. Out of all my siblings, my parents say that I am the only one that struggled to learn English. My older sister was just as hungry for knowledge as me, and my parents noticed that very quickly. My older brother and younger sister were not as eager to learn, but they were not stupid either. Eventually, both me and my sister grew up to be the top of our classes, with the highest lexile score, and some of the best Reading/Literature scores in our classes. Our parents thought we both would continue this in high school and live great lives. Or so they thought… My sister didn't keep it up in high school. She is the eldest sibling I have, born in 1998 while I was born in 2004. She applied to the same high school I am now going to, and made it in. This high school was the newest school in our district, and was already becoming one of the best schools in the state. As of today, the school is not even 20 years old. My parents made the mistake of taking that for granted, and expected her to be a student with straight A's and spend all her day doing homework and several other things that overwhelmed my sister. My sister couldn't handle all the pressure my parents gave her, and hated how they expected the most from her since she was the smartest mind in our household apparently. Consequently, my parents overwhelmed her to the point where she dropped out of her high school, and it was only the 1st semester. She was then transferred to another school in the same district. This school was seen as a failure at the time, and for my parents, this was the biggest disappointment they had ever seen. They didn't know how to handle this, and only pressured her more. My sister fell into a state of depression where she failed to eat, failed to be on top of her class, and failed to interact with me, or any of my other siblings. She couldn't handle everything going on. My sister finished her freshman year in this school, and my mother found her a job at a local McDonald's. Both my mom and sister worked at this McDonald's for a while. Now, my sister met a guy at this McDonald's, and while she had her break, she would go and hang out with this guy, who was a janitor. My mother noticed it, but didn't have that much of a problem with it (even though she usually didn't allow my sister to have boyfriends). She didn't think it would be serious at any point. But my father took it to a whole other level. He was overprotective of my sister and did not want to allow it to continue. My sister was so disappointed in my father, that she stopped trying to get even decent grades in school, and did not care about what happened. After her sophomore year, she dropped out again, and did not go back to high school. During the summer of that year, she ran away from our household, and ran to the guy's house to live with him. At first my parents were completely against it and almost tried to get police involved in the matter, but then my mom came to her senses and thought about the guy (whom she knew from work), and thought it wasn't really a bad idea if they were serious about their intentions. My sister was 17 years old at the time, and my parents saw themselves in my sister (my parents married at around the same age, and had my sister not much after their wedding). They gave the guy their blessing and told him if he was serious about their relationship, they should marry as soon as possible. On April 1st, 2016, my sister married her man, and not much later, she became pregnant with the most beautiful baby girl in the world. That baby is the biggest blessing in my sisters life, and she would give the world to her baby in a heartbeat if she could. As for me, my parents learned from their mistake, and did not expect me to deliver the best grades, but did expect me to put my best effort. I have the most AP classes a freshman could ever have, participate in several after school activities, engage in teaching other students material that they do not understand, and I have the most supportive parents in the world. I'm seen as the smart boy in the family now, and whenever my parents need to know something, I'm the one they ask. They do not know a single word of English. One time, my mother even encountered a racist woman at a popular mall, with the woman telling her to speak English and “learn the language of the world”. Mind you, I was looking at shoes in a store, and when I saw my mother through the window getting spoken loudly at by a white woman with broken toenails and a hideous yellow hat, I put 2 &2 together and I immediately walked outside, and defended my mother, to the point where security escorted the woman out of the mall. My mother was proud of my behavior that day, and told me she was proud of the person I was now becoming. She does not take my intelligence for granted, and is proud that I still love learning new things and enjoy going to school. She called my older sister later that day to tell her what I had done, and my sister expressed her pride in me, and was proud that I was becoming a great role model for my younger sister. Little did my older sister know, she was my role model ever since I was a kid, and her failure is what continues to keep me going to this day. So parents, when raising a high-IQ child, do NOT expect them to give you the world. Don't overwhelm them and give them expectations that would make them feel like failures should they not accomplish said expectation!"},{"instruction":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","output":"Perfume is basically the same as a scent. The names signify the concentration of oils/chemicals in the fragrance. Parfum is the strongest, being 20–40% concentration. Eau de Parfum being 15–20%, eau de toilette being 10–15% and cologne being 5–10%. That said, cologne is nowdays used as a generic term for men’s fragrances by many companies. Generally, this happens more on the lower cost spectrum of fragrances. There are a couple other terms like esprit de parfum and eau fraiche, but it has been a very long time since seeing a company use that term. Generally speaking, the higher the concentration: the more intense, the longer lasting, and the more projecting a fragrance is.

I prefer to use Apple Maps, but the store computer uses google so that’s what we’re supposed to use as well. Yes- I do switch many times to Apple once I’m on the road. It will usually lead me to the right place. At night, the best thing you can do is have a house number on the front of the house visible from the road. Have a porch light on.

What the first thing you do when you get in the car. You put your foot on the brake pedal… Duh! If someone cut your brake lines the pedal will drop to the floor. That will tell your brain or whatever you have rattling around up there that something is WRONG. A person of average intelligence would think, hmmmm, why did my brake pedal just go way farther than it usually does. They will then lift their foot and press the pedal again, and if it continues to go to the floorboard they would conclude something isnt right here, I should check my brake fluid before I go for a drive. Right then and there they will see that the brake reservoir is empty. Follow up investigation by even a stupid person would reveal that the brake lines had been cut and someone was trying to murder them. Then they would call the cops. On the upside, the person who believes cutting the brake lines would be a good way to kill you and make it look like an accident is a really really dumb person and believes that there is anything real on tv. That person is almost as dumb as you'd have to be to drive off without testing your brakes first. That means they are going to do really stupid things that will lead the cops straight to them. So be a responsible driver and inspect your car. Check all fluids once per week. Walk around the car before you drive off at least once per day to make sure you dont have a low tire. And always press and hold firmly on the brake pedal before you drive off to be sure you do not have a leak. If you have a slow leak the pedal will fall slowly. If you have a big leak it will fall quickly. Take comfort in knowing that only a moron would try to harm someone by cutting their brake lines and morons get themselves caught.

I think the main reason Punk Rock is not as popular as it used to be is because people nowadays have, mostly, been sucked into the stereotypical pop music and pop culture, with the generic breakup songs and highly-groomed boy bands etc. Punk Rock is very much alive, and most likely, will be for a long time into the future.

Her father, a farmer who owned a tiny land in Kulwa village about some kms south west of Kolkata, was unable to feed his 14 children. Her mother scoured the land, begging for rice from the churches, ashrams, NGOs, government offices and landlords of the area. Over the next few years, seven of the children died.At 12, Subhashini was married off to Chandra, an agricultural worker who lived in Hanspukur village.In 1971. Her husband began writhing in pain and she rushed him to the district hospital in Tollygunge, Kolkata.The doctors and nurses refused to pay any attention to him because he was penniless,thisgovernment hospital was mandated to provide free service to the poor. But reality was you needed either money or connections to get treatment. Death ended her husband’s life.Through her tears and fears, Subhashini made an oath that fateful day. No one should suffer her fate. Basic medical attention could easily have saved her husband.poverty and callous hospital staff had killed her husband. She vowed she would do what it takes to spare people of this nightmare. She would build a hospital for the poor. Soon she felt that she could pick vegetables that grew on the wayside in Dhapa village and sell them. She realized that selling vegetables would fetch more money than doing other people’s housework.For 20 years, she scrimped and saved. She spent nothing on herself and little on her children, except for Ajoy’s education.In 1992, she bought one acre of land in her husband’s village, Hanspukur, for Rs.10,000. She moved back with her children to her husband’s hut.She gathered the villagers and told them of her plan. She would donate her one acre land for the hospital, but the villagers would have to donate money to build a thatched shed that could serve as a dispensary for the poor.The public donation totaled Rs.926. Some villagers contributed in kind - providing bamboos, palm leaves, truckloads of earth, wooden planks. The poorest offered their labour. Thus, a 20 feet by 20 feet temporary shed was constructed in 1993.Then an auto rickshaw with a loudspeaker plied the countryside, pleading with doctors to offer their free service at the newly opened Hanspukur shed at least once a week for the poor and needy.Some doctors came with their free services,on the very first day 251 patients were treated.Humanity hospital, as the little shed was named, never looked back.Not that the going was easy. Monsoon was pure hell. There was knee deep water inside the shed. The patients had to be treated on the road. So it was decided to build a concrete roof covering a 1,000 sq feet area. This required much more money. So Subhashini and her son Ajoy cast the net wider.Ajoy knocked on the door of the local Member of Parliament, Malini Bhattacharya. At first, he made no headway. The door remained firmly shut. But he persisted. Bit by bit, the door opened and finally he managed to meet the MP and explain his mother’s goal.Over a period of time, he won her over and after seeing with her own eyes Subhashini’s single minded devotion to her charitable work, Malini supported the Humanity Hospital whole heartedly.In the meantime, Ajoy got admitted into the prestigious Kolkaka Medical College and after graduation, attended to the day to day running of the Humanity Hospital. Through all this growth, Subhashini was clear about her goal. This was a hospital for the poor. This was not a business. Yet, she knew that the hospital had to be self sufficient. It cannot survive forever on donations. But her mission is not over yet. Says she: “Only when this hospital becomes a full-fledged 24-hour hospital can I die happy.” Today a hospital made by a veg-seller’s perspiration whose husband died due to lack of money is serving poor people around the country for free.

I had been displaced after escaping hurricane Katrina & my only option was to go back to Chicago for a few months. At the time, my grandfather had recently passed away from cancer at 92 years old. My grandmother was 89, and had been suffering from alzheimers for years. She was still being cared for by family & 1 hired assistant. My mom thought it'd be a good idea if I stayed with my grandmother for a few reasons. 1 being a lack of space & 2 being an extra hand. I was all for it. My grandmother was always a loving, caring, nurturer. So, I arrived late at night after driving from Nola to Chicago in one straight shot. I was exhausted. As soon as I got in my parents house, their dog (whom I'd never met before) attacked me. That's a whole other story. Anyways, after I was functional again, I went to my grandmother's home on the north side. I had never experienced an interaction with someone suffering with dementia before. When I walked in the house, I was greeted by my aunt & the assistant. They said grandma was napping, so I went ahead & talked a while, then put my stuff away in the basement. A few hours later, my grandmother woke up. She seemed ok. Slightly aloof, quieter than I remember, but had a big smile on her face. I said my hellos and hugged her. She hugged me back very lovingly. She said, “oh patty, you came to see me!” I am not patty. My mom is patty. I just smiled and said, “oh no grandma, I'm not patty. It's me, Melissa, her daughter. I've come to hang out with you for a while.” She responded, “oh. You look so much like her.” …………… If we stayed face to face, she would know me as me. If I walked away & came back, she would know me as my mom. It saddened me. I did a lot of research about alzheimers. One thing I learned was that her quality of life would be better if she stayed active & had mental & physical stimulation. So, that's what I did. I know she was a creative and resourceful person. I set up activities for us to do together every day. We made lampshades, drew Halloween decorations, played easy games, & those sort of things. One day my other aunt was there when we began a project. She snatched up our ribbon and sneered, “what a waste of time. She's not gonna remember it in 5 minutes anyway.” I also noticed a pattern. My grandmother had a big cabinet filled with prescription medication. Whenever certain aunts came over, my grandma would suddenly go to sleep for hours and hours. She was sleeping probably 20 hours out of the day. After she woke up each time, she'd be lost, scared, and disoriented. She wasn't behaving like that on the days certain relatives didn't come. I'd always calm her down. She thought I was patty, & I began to just go along with it. Also, in the 3.5 months I was there, her health declined further. She kept asking why she was in the new house (her & my grandpa had 2 houses. My aunts sold off the old one along with all their valuables when my grandpa died. Greed. Grandma had no clue). She would cry for her husband, wanting to know where he was. I was torn. What is the right thing to do? I decided that keeping her calm & happy was the priority. I told her, “don't worry ‘mom'. Dad had to go in to work early. We're at the new house because the old house is having some plumbing issues. Everything is fine. I'm here with you. Want some tea?” I swear on everything, it was the best thing I could have done for her. I couldn't bare the thought of telling her her husband is dead, her house is gone, & that she's losing her mind. It would be cruel. She would live in torture, being told that multiple times per day… reliving it in an endless cycle. I was 21. I don't know if it was the right thing to do, but it felt like the right thing for her. Oh, and I figured out why she was sleeping all the time…. My aunts were drugging her by overmedicating. Xanax. When they were talking about it, they complained about her being a nuisance. They wanted her to just sleep so they didn't have to care for her. I told on them to my mom."},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"The most horrible things I’ve seen in the mental hospital have been staff mistreatment. I’ve seen scary and heartbreaking things the patients have done, sure, but all of the top things that come to mind have been done by staff. I’ve seen a staff member restrain a girl who had severe PTSD and was having a (non violent) meltdown, except the main trigger for her PTSD was being held/restrained. She ended up being tied to a bed because she’d started trying to hit the staff to get them off of her after they wouldn’t let go when she pleaded. She screamed until she was finally too exhausted to keep going anymore. She was kept in full restraint for 48 hours, only let up to go to the bathroom and eat dinner (both supervised by two staff members at a time). Her “meltdown” was sitting in a corner screaming, crying, and shaking after another patient aggressively grabbed her arm and wouldn’t let go. I’ve seen multiple male staff members lay their full body weight on the same teenage girl who is having a psychotic episode. I’ve seen staff hold people down and shove feeding tubes into their noses so aggressively that their noses and the back of their throat was bleeding. I don’t know if you’ve ever had a feeding tube placed, but it’s a pretty damn unpleasant process with even the most gentle of nurses. I’ve heard them sitting in the nurses stations and talking about which patients they hated and what they could do to make that patient’s life harder. I’ve seen nurses and LPNs refuse patients PRN medications because they’d “gotten [themselves] worked up and now need to deal with the consequences” when that’s literally the point of those medications. I’ve seen patients who are too depressed to get out of bed or shower or clean their rooms being taunted for it and told how pathetic and disgusting they are. I’ve heard them tell people who’ve tried to kill themselves that it was just for attention and if they were actually suicidal they would’ve succeeded. You might not know this, but it’s relatively difficult to kill yourself, especially for women who don’t usually choose the most effective methods like gunshot out of fear for leaving too much of a mess for their families to clean up. I’ve met homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, racist, classist, islamophobic, every kind of -phobic or -ist staff. I’ve met staff who genuinely seem to hate mentally ill people and working in a psychiatric hospital, and who make it known. These are just a small handful of things I’ve witnessed and personally experienced on psychiatric wards. This doesn’t even go into the way ER staff treats mentally ill people before they even get to psych which is often worse. Some of these things might seem minor compared to some of the more extreme actions of a few patients, but to me it’s more horrible because they’re making an active choice to be as nasty as possible to people going through some of the worst times of their lives. Many of the patients who might be violent or combative aren’t in their right minds and aren’t able to make rational decisions to control their behavior or thoughts, while a staff member’s actions are absolutely a conscious choice. What’s the point of it? What is it going to accomplish except kicking someone while they’re already down at rock bottom?

However, it's important to note that rapid weight loss can be challenging to sustain and may not be as healthy as gradual weight loss. Here are some tips if you're looking to lose weight quickly: [LINKED_TEXT: Weight Loss in Just 07 DaysWeight Loss in Just 07 Dayshttps://dreamtoslim.blogspot.com/] [URL: https://dreamtoslim.blogspot.com/]Consult a Healthcare Professional: Before making any drastic changes to your diet or exercise routine, it's crucial to consult a doctor or registered dietitian. They can help you create a safe and effective plan tailored to your individual needs and health status.Create a Calorie Deficit: Weight loss occurs when you burn more calories than you consume. Calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and reduce your daily calorie intake to create a calorie deficit. Aim for a safe deficit of around 500 to 1000 calories per day, which can lead to a weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week.Focus on Whole Foods: Opt for nutrient-dense, whole foods like lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats. These foods are more filling and can help control your hunger while providing essential nutrients.Portion Control: Be mindful of portion sizes. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if you consume them in large quantities. Using smaller plates and bowls can help you manage portion sizes.Reduce Sugar and Processed Foods: Minimize your intake of sugary beverages, sweets, and highly processed foods. These items can contribute to excess calorie consumption and make it harder to lose weight.Increase Physical Activity: Incorporate regular exercise into your routine. A mix of cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training can help you burn calories and build lean muscle mass, which increases your metabolism.Stay Hydrated: Drinking water can help control your appetite and support your metabolism. Aim to drink plenty of water throughout the day.Limit Eating Out and Fast Food: Restaurant meals and fast food tend to be higher in calories, unhealthy fats, and sodium. Cooking at home gives you more control over your ingredients and portion sizes.Get Enough Sleep: Sleep is essential for weight loss and overall health. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night, as poor sleep can disrupt hormones that regulate hunger and appetite.Manage Stress: High stress levels can lead to emotional eating and weight gain. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or spending time doing activities you enjoy.Track Your Progress: Keep a journal of your food intake, exercise routine, and how you're feeling. This can help you identify patterns, celebrate your successes, and make adjustments as needed.

They have no feelings sympathy and empathy they they lack okay so always remember that it is it's like they're born Rude by Nature and it's true a lot of them have parents and issues or childhood traumas where they would either molested or abused or just mistreated and then some of them saw how their mother was treated and I guess that's how they treat women I want to say so in it and it has a lot of the deal with their mental capacity so if I was you I'll just leave them alone and leave them blocked because in the end later on you going to wish you had their evil they got the they got bad look attached to some of them cuz if you leave some of them alone you'll see how God start bringing blessings in your life some of them are just that janky where you know they cause you to start having bad luck when you start stressing yourself out physically and your health will take take bad control like my last boyfriend he had an issue a medical issue he gave me an STD he should have let me know because I'm going to cancel Survivor and not saying that you can get cancer from somebody that probably already got prostate cancer but you you probably can if there's sperm or semen got into you he never let me know about his medical issue now I'm sick as a dog I'm going I got heart problems I have a tumor and I got to have a bossy I got to have a tea pool because I kept getting the infection he just wasn't good for me to get involved with but he tried to be good to me it's just when I figured out it was another person I know my worth I'm nobody's second play you know what I'm saying and if I come to your house and you got company over there we make plans earlier that day and you set up to my it don't matter what the plans is I supposed to call before come and I called you and text you and you did not respond you're supposed to respond and say, not I'm available but then if you already got company over then.

The reason is we really do adopt each other as family. It’s not just some title. It’s something we live. I’ve never heard of any family being upset by friends attending a funeral, but if it would have happened that family simply didn’t request a Masonic funeral service. I’ve been to a lot of funerals while I was a lodge officer. The biggest one we overflowed to fill the entire lot the church was in. The smallest funeral I was to there were the 3 of us from lodge, the widow and the dead Brother. They had moved to our city after retirement. None of us even knew him. His widow just watched us in amazement that we actually lived up to what we say about being an adoptive family.

Perfume, eau de toilette, and cologne are the three types of fragrances, and each has its own unique scent and characteristics. Perfume is the most concentrated and long-lasting form of fragrance. Perfumes are made with high concentrations of essential oils and other fragrant compounds like musks and resins, which lend to their strong and lasting scent. Perfumes are typically the most expensive type of fragrance due to their high concentrations of essential oils. Eau de toilette is a light and fresh scent, made with lower concentrations of essential oils than perfume. This type of fragrance is usually more affordable than perfume and has a lighter scent that lasts for several hours. It is also quite popular for daytime wear. Cologne is a light, fruity scent that is usually made with citrus and floral notes. Cologne is usually lighter and less concentrated than both perfume and eau de toilette and is often used as an aftershave. When shopping for fragrances, it is important to keep in mind the different types of fragrances and what type best suits your needs. From light and fresh scents for everyday wear to more concentrated and long-lasting scents for special occasions, there is something for everyone."},{"instruction":"there any truth to what QAnon is saying?","output":"I’ve never heard about QAnon except from a liberal."},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"This probably isn't as bad as the stories other people have, but it was completely inappropriate and cemented my opinion that that particular facility would be absolutely useless for me. There was an 18 or 19 year old kid in there, and he was convinced that drug dealers were trying to kill him and that some of the staff and patients were plants placed by the drug dealers to kill him inside the facility. One night, he kept coming out of his room requesting help because he was extremely paranoid that someone was going to kill him that night. The staff just kept yelling at him from down the hallway to get back in his bed. When he wouldn't, they walked down to him to continue yelling at him. He told them very calmly (he was always calm despite fearing for his life) that he was sure patients and staff were going to kill him and that he needed to be safe by himself somewhere. They asked him if he thought they were going to kill him. He said yes. Their reply was to tell him “bitch I might if you don't get the fuck back in your room.” Then they basically screamed him back into his room where he sat awake all night waiting to be murdered. I was already fed up with the facility by that point and after they screamed him into his room I popped my head out of my room and yelled “that's shit is getting fucking reported.” They ignored me. They always ignored me because I was pissed with the treatment they gave me and others from the time I got there and called them out all the time. It got reported. Oh, here's another one I just remembered. Same facility (I've only been to one once for 5 days). A guy in his mid 20s was either some sort of psychotic or on some really good drugs and was going on and on about how he was back from the grave to save us all/kill us all. He flip flopped back and forth. He kept saying n***a. He was white, half the staff and patients were black. The staff’s reaction was to be racist toward him and threaten to beat his ass. Like, the dude is not right either in general or just in that moment for whatever reason. That's not really the time to address racism, received it real, and it's not ever appropriate to threaten the patients. I reported that one too. That whole place was a joke. I get that patients need to be managed and the environment needs to be stable and calm, but they went way beyond that by treating everyone like a child. I didn't want a bag of chips one day because I wasn't hungry. I got told I had to eat them, that I needed to eat them now, and the bag was thrown at me. I spoke up for myself and got told to go to my room. I didn't go in there intending to be defiant, but the staff was just so volatile and out of line in an environment where that is in no way acceptable that I refused them a lot. In the end I was never forced to do anything. They'd push, I'd push back if I thought they were wrong, and I got left alone. Of course, this was brought up to the psychiatrist who held it against me, but he was useless anyway. He tried to diagnose me with bipolar 2 after maybe 5 minutes of talking to me and abruptly leaving the room without a word. He scolded me for not starting my treatment when nobody ever told me what my treatment was. He talked down to me for refusing to take lithium (I would never. I have friends and family who are bipolar 2 and they absolutely hated it and I saw the way it turned them into non-functioning zombies). I brought all my concerns and experiences up to his assistant, who brought in another assistant and a student to talk to me as a learning experience in recognizing bad treatment, and arranged a meeting between me and the director of the hospital. I laid everything out for the director and I was released the next day. Needless to say, I have absolutely no faith in inpatient treatment now."},{"instruction":"What is the cheapest city in San Francisco Bay Area?","output":"The “BURBS” Google a map."},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"There is a complete chapter popularly known as the RUDRAM in the Krishna Yajurveda.

Could Flanders ever become independent or join the Netherlands in the future?","output":"Joining the Netherlands would be the joining of 6 million people in Flanders against 17 million in the Netherlands. Neither group would care for this. The Flemish would be in a strikingly obvious minority compared to now being the majority population in Belgium and having more to say in how the country is run. Yes, some Flemish parties bitch and groan incessantly about how Belgium is run, but joining the Netherlands would turn Flanders into an irrelevant region. Nor would the Dutch care to have 6 million mildly anarchist Belgians suddenly become Dutch citizens with a minority say in their government. It would break up Dutch politics as they know it. The same goes for the Dutch economy. The two great ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp are already in competition with each other. Imagine the two being joined in one and the same country and the infighting and special-interest politicking would become even more intense and deadly. Flanders might be economically viable as an independent country, but who then would they have to bitch about with Wallonia gone? All failures and mistakes would have to owned instead of blamed on the other part of the country. And new regional differences would inevitably come to the forefront. Just more of the same bickering, but with different partners with the Flemish provinces standing off against Antwerp or Limburg. No one needs that. Luckily, most Belgians, Flemish and Walloons, instinctively recognize this and while they might talk big in some instances, most political parties know better than to threaten their power base with an going into an unknown adventure. They also know that Brussels would be a Gordian knot of epic proportions to ever untie satisfactorily to everyone’s expectations. And that without even taking the EU into account, which after all has its (unofficial) capital in Brussels. Mess around with that and no one knows what will happen. And since having the EU capital in Belgium is quite the boon and advantage both in economic terms and in terms of prestige, politicians know that despite all the bluster and hot air, Belgium will continue along as it has successfully done for almost 200 years now. Not all modern nations can boast of being so successful. It would also be nice if people realized that sharing a common language does not make countries candidates for becoming a political union of countries. Belgian culture, in the sociological sense, is very unlike Dutch culture."},{"instruction":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","output":"Vlad Dracul is idealised by many Romanians, with the naive theory that \\"he was killing only the thugs and robbers\\".

Launched in 2006, JoomlaLMS has undergone a lot of changes in terms of design, functionality and usability and today the LMS is in widespread use for managing content, classes and teachers. Let’s name some of the JoomlaLMS benefits for education One of the main JoomlaLMS advantages is that the learning platform can be used by multiple faculties and teachers without interfering with one another, similar to the way a traditional school operates. A teacher sets the maximum class attendants number, communicates with the enrolled students, has access to the reports, sets homework, checks attendance and grades only the appointed students.SCORM and AICC compatibility allows teachers to save time and efforts on learning materials creation. A teacher can reuse the old course content or upload an external one.When teaching online a teacher is free to experiment by applying different learning techniques such as blended learning, flipped learning, social learning, rapid learning, storytelling, microlearning etc. Thereby they can decide on the technique to make learning as engaging and effective as possible.Thanks to a variety of communication tools available a teacher can talk to students and lead them through the learning process.The learning materials can be united into learning paths (a learning path is a sequence of steps a student needs to take to pass the course), making it possible for a teacher to structure the course content and control the students’ progress.What concerns the students’ assessment, tracking and reporting, there is an embedded quiz tool with a variety of question types and an advanced system of reports to help the teacher to find gaps in the students’ knowledge and pay more attention to those learners who lag behind.For the learners who are always on the go, there is an iOS and Android compatible mobile application available. The students can easily check the course announcements, view the grades, access their certificates etc. All of it opens wide opportunities for mobile learning.Another important feature is the extended Certificates functionality. The teacher can not only award a certificate for the outstanding completion of the course, but to secure it with a serial number, a watermark and a bar code to avoid falsification.It is worth mentioning that if a school wants to make the eLearning project unique, it is possible to customize the functionality of JoomlaLMS by integrating it with third-party extensions and services. However, the best way to get to know the system and decide whether it suits the school’s needs is to test it yourself, especially since the company offers a 30-days free trial with no credit card information required. To try JoomlaLMS you need to submit your request at the [LINKED_TEXT: JoomlaLMS website] [URL: https://www.joomlalms.com/trial-request.html]."},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"Hello!

Amateur Radio is not like CB or FRS or MURS, where licensing is nebulous or ignored or poorly enforced. The FCC has field operations that will locate an unlicensed station, confiscate the equipment, and fine the illegal operator thousands of dollars. Even if the unlicensed operator's actions have not escalated to the point of getting the attention of the FCC, Radio Amateurs are zealous in the protection of their assigned frequenies and will use direction-finding technology to track down the offending station. Anyone desiring to become a Radio Amateur should be smart by studying for the test, passing the exam, and waiting for their license to be granted before transmitting."},{"instruction":"want to improve the ROI of my digital marketing activities of my online fashion store.

But it's more like a concept for reminding us to stay low and humble and to not hurt anyone. Everytime I have bad things happen to me, just like my current relationship, I try to analyze, including asking myself, what have I done in the past that makes me into this kind of problem. What have I done wrong? Whom I've been hurted? We all have two sides, good sides and bad sides. And sometimes, we don't realize our bad sides hurt people. Whatever pain we put in other people, it sends bad negative vibes to us. If it's too painful for the other person, the more bad negative vibes coming to us. If we have bad negative vibes, we will often go having unlucky experiences. Why the corruptor seems happy and not being touched by the justice? It's what we always see from the outside. We all have no idea about the situation of their family, isn't it? What if they have problematic sons or daughters? What if they don't feel peace every night during their sleeps? Those unseen things make us always wonder if karma does exist or not. It does. What you plant is what you reap. What goes around always comes around. Does it happen to everyone? Yes, even it can be passed through generations. You might think you are now happy for hurting people, but God always hears the cries and counts the tears you've caused. What you've planted, it might happen to your generations as well. Have fear to hurt people. Just be kind to people, it's doable. We just live for maximum 80 years.

All objects radiate infrared energy all the time. On Earth, we seldom notice this because in most situations, this is a small flow of energy compared to the energy we exchange with the air and water around us by direct physical contact. Because of this, we mostly only notice infrared radiation when we are near a strong heat source—like a fire. A fire can obviously burn you by direct contact, but a hot enough fire (or space heater) can burn you just by being close—by irradiating you with strong infrared. Space is not cold in the sense of a brisk Siberian winter’s morn, where -100 F winds actively leach heat from the body and carry it away to Norilsk. No, space is cold in the sense of being the opposite of a space heater (no pun indended). Space is an inexhaustible heat sink. An object in space radiates heat away just like you are doing right now. But there is no air to be warmed by that infrared, so that energy is just gone. Unless near a star, any object will continue radiating energy away until it (the object) is very, very cold indeed. Near the Earth, space isn’t really cold. An object in space will heat up on its sunlit side by about the same amount it cools on the shady side. As long as the object rotates or has some flow of air or water within it, it will maintain a fairly Earth-like temperature—no problem. But otherwise, the sunlit side will get hot and the shaded side will get cold. Space itself, however, cannot have a temperature in this sense—only an energy density or radiant flux density."},{"instruction":"Are namjoon and rm close?","output":"they’re the same person 👁👁"},{"instruction":"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) worth watching if you found Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) to be plodding and maddeningly slowpaced?","output":"Even die hard Trekkies would fully agree with ‘slow-paced and plodding’ as a review of The Motion Picture.

Its FAR better paced and written than TMP and rightly considered the best of the Trek films by most. Search for Spock is, well. It has its moments but can’t come close even though it follows on from WoK. Voyage Home finishes off an unintended trilogy and is a nice fun change of pace. Final Frontier can be skipped, its not good. Undiscovered Country is a good ending for The Original Series period."},{"instruction":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","output":"No."},{"instruction":"Will Akhilesh Yadav be able to form his government this time in the Uttar Pradesh 2022 elections?","output":"No"},{"instruction":"w will humans look in 1000 years?","output":"Each child is granted with care givers to tend to all needs, not until an age of learning of the wants the child desires will happen as if a given honor . Every bit of wealth at their expense the children are educated to fit their lives beyond the needs . Innovation is granted, as drive is encouraged, empathy is guaranteed, as patience is of virtue, creative intent shall be shared, as with a passion of love, self-motivation and self-confidence go hand in hand and group co-operation can only be enhanced . Never to be remembered as there was no way of learning wrong historical beliefs, their dreams were blank slots during the regular 45 minutes of sleep. To awake and yearn for more food was a happy time . to wake and crawl as far as they could go battle in the wind to find a private hollow to excrete their humanly waste, which could be of misery mostly, unable to stay clean . To be thankful for the attire they wore and the sacred cloth in which to wipe themselves clean, doled out by their mother, regulated only like a single hug on any given day . The days and nights are spent with so many hours of gratitude for the honorable situation . As if landing on another planet the only real trace of a kind of memory was through genetics and instinctual reaction to the surroundings could only have become a long evolved foregone conclusion after seeing how the villages clockwork style pathways were created with a hint of latitude and longitude shortcuts . Miss fits is not the name to title any of these ladies, each was quite different in their own way, gifted shall be not taken lightly . On clear weathered mornings the sun rolls down the cheeks of the hillside, the sun comes down as you look westward every clear morning and goes up as we look eastwardly each clear early eve . Sometimes all we could see would be the shrouded in pillowing clouds after a shortened drought, rolling thunder clouds are an added beauty, with streaks that dart sporadically . Flickering sunsets stage a dream whilst the changing atmospheric pressure is not reluctant to add chaos . The parks and natural refuges that had become limited and more so throughout the years . Each of all, though few have fully enjoyed parks and nature on a variety of locations through their life more times than an average urbanite . City life was once was historically recorded to be the only way to continue, it had been an era of a dreadful capitalism state . Instead of enjoying nature as the rest of the world's fauna life, people once believed they were smart enough to be better . Discovering it is not easy to be better if you are a simple wounded soul, only as good as yourself, refusing to understand the basics, that are attributed to the complex being, to once realize complexity only exists working together . The parks and nature that lay within the cities are the areas closest to the largest populations, places where it is over visited, and uninsulated from the need to have been close to any sort of development . Not that these areas have been less prone to the widespread of cancerous airborne pollutants, it is the areas least ravished by the effects of the most concentration of toxins . Each of the ladies are like the chosen few from different regions with simple beliefs unheard of . Not to have followed the rhetoric of most of the outspoken advertised leaders of the old days . To fund much of the hokey politics tax not necessarily over nominal value . The young unaware of the fairness of a living wage started to what they thought were careers at an unsuspecting demise . As for the developed tradesperson, full-time office worker, even the independent contractors, business owners, shopkeepers and employees, health workers, teachers, and government workers were now told their wages were less than half and for some dedicated but not simultaneously preferred, and even the aged would work for volunteer without pay . Every tidbit of wealth is delivered to each of the youth, as one gets older the less wealth is available and all the necessities are always for most of the younger ones, the more of life's essentials are required to ensure midlife could be successful, carrying on like donkeys following the carrot . Scientists had found been found lying and collaborated fully and once the funding diminished each had only a part of the problem within their studies, experiments, and thesis . It would have taken a great leader, one that never evolved simply because within each political move, it never seemed proper for many minds to collaborate even when they had slight differences . It is now the time for a true evolution one might insist to finally come in existence . Cities were the highest of concentration of every cancerous material, cheaper building supplies, most of which that were produced like an artificial remedy from oil byproducts were devastating to the lives as they slowly poisoned the population . The oil hogging automobile was choking off the youngest of generations . Airplanes were no longer needed or wanted for the massive populations that they would move . The carefully electrically engineered mass transit has been a complete engineering sham . All new electronics once thought to make life much easier was producing irreversible damage to the youth from its microwave noise . Farming productivity using the genetically modified factor was another big hoax killing off 90% of the richest of the elderly, never mind too many of the people that could afford the rising costs . Cities have been come completely disease infected, and only the few that did not subside to the draw and need to live in the once only thought of as fraudulent partially criminal style of behavior, racing for the imaginary money with the need was never enough . Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii . The parasite was only known to reproduce sexually in the cat family. It can infect most types of warm-blooded animals, including humans . Up to half of the world's population are infected by toxoplasmosis having many different symptoms . Most would say \\"This is a catastrophic disaster...\\" just before the men could start a WWIII, assuming Mother Nature was not larger than all the MEN and their kind . Women being of a different nature summed it up as an uncoordinated gait, as if they had faith from an unknown religion . The love of wisdom was of greatness when wisdom was only held by a few . As it is now proven that all the wisdom should have been shared and not hidden, knowing most of the written wisdom's were falsehoods that brought about this evolution . It is now known there were too many fundamental problems exceeding all others, existence knowledge values reason mind and language belonged to a brief list, and questioning, critical discussion, rational argument in systematic presentation were still not enough when you blindsided the rest of the men, or women would say the man blindsided themselves by not paying attention to the whole picture . Natural philosophy was surely a key, moral philosophy was upset when man or men thought they could make the rules betwixt right and wrong in what was beautiful and what was just, without collaborating with all of society and realizing earth . One of the first mistakes might be pushing awfully hard on the meta-physical philosophy telling a lower class that God logic and forms and other abstract objects in the most complicated mathematical calculations are too misunderstood for simple children and women to understand . The mistake was much more complicated for philosophy to conclude just as it was the biggest joke was revealed in the 21st century, some may even conclude it was of the simplest religions, social economics . The question is how anyone could ever believe that an imaginary god called Money could ever exist in anything but a dream or dark vision . Now “AI” governs every decision without remorse as the input data from every single person has been added . Habits dissolve with the passing of an era, advancing to the elaborate newest normal . Medical advances become a second-hand practice the genome manipulation is the cure . Criminal activity disappears with no gain of the intent . Leaders take a new title, as responsible guidance with any momentary change, the followers/workers are garnered extremely valuable . The history books of one-sided lies of the past, written by so called scholars, edited by the elite driven bureaucracy, politically motivated . Finding it difficult for the old tale of repeating history as the logics is only the hopes and dreams of the most aged . Psychology is rewritten when recent technology roars ahead faster the memories of the bold golden years, sociology is the driver for the absolute majority, the love of wisdom becomes reinstated for real sciences of sub conscience idealism, unlike the poorly played out religions . The memory of why to be better bigger and the best has no motive as the need the work together is the only advantage . With a universal catalogue, all can add, restate, elaborate detail for all the use readily . Quite a simple fundamental folly, the dream must be the need of all not only the ones that are greedy, but trade will also just go on naturally . Now knowing what we've should have been collaborating with and sharing with everyone is like having a vision of what would be good for even somebody I would not consider a friend but would find needing them up most at certain times . Overwhelming number of the population were becoming depressed, not able to cohabitate with meager wages that were instituted on every working soul . Suicide rates became the largest rising phenomena, along with murders in the highest population areas . Surprisingly, drug fiend anomaly was the fewest of deaths, as they coped in euphoria . The parks and cheapest gathering facilities left had become extremely overpopulated . So many people walk around the city sidewalks and malls, completely penniless, searching for a friendship or a large gathering, trying to see what others are doing to exist. The new world government had no choice other than to enforce martial law . Arming strong healthy young men and women to uphold the law, with the pay like any store clerk/gardener/baker deemed to be all essential workers . Essential workers: farm, animal care, food processor, warehouse, first aid, emergency, medical care, child care, aged care, public care, vulnerable public, volunteers, retailors, restaurant, inspection, businesses, public services, support staff, landlords, temporary accommodation staff, staff services, real-estate and registration staff, regulatory, translators, accountants, engineers, lawyers, legal service, meteorologist, functions or service, postal service, education, construction, maintenance, coroners, insurance, accounting, capital fund management, cyber incident, media, communication, information, utility, waste, cleaners, convenient stops, traffic control, transportation regulators, refinery, industry, manufacturing, mining, forestry, defense, and security, with government (local, regional, provincial, federal) coordinating; workers . Fevers started a division of the population, the ignorant were told it was simply global warming at its worse, possible because the Earth's temperatures were rising by a few degrees every year, of course melting the polar caps at alarming rates. Jaundice was ignored, government was blaming this large group of people for being outdoors too much and told them it was a form of sunburn . Obesity was one of the world's greatest obsessions, many had this diagnosis from the doctor's calculation gathered by a separate entity of scientists, all sugars and carbohydrates were taxed to the most of extreme by the failing governmental establishments . The scientists were overjoyed when the largest enumeration of the population was losing weight, gradually so that the government would advertise that a generation can be saved and here is the proof, showing overweight people, in their normal circumstances, eating sugary treats and processed foods, driving short distances, simply not exercising with before and after pictures and videos . Many of the youth and extremely healthy were also obscurely dying from symptomatic seizures, starting with mild tremors. Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain coexisted with the many too weak to socialize or even get out of their failing abode . Some even stayed away from family friends, embarrassed that they were losing their eyesight rapidly, and those that became in complete paralysis not able to move extremely far . A growing number thought it was okay to sustain the loss of appetite they had newly developed, as they simply could not afford the overbearing costs of feeding anyway . Lethargy was not tolerated as many were thought to be evolving the deliberate neglect of others . Those showing these symptoms just did not want to have anything to do with the faltering economics that once was believed to be the only way . None of this was learned on the onus proband of one person, derived from continually mindless brainwashing from the worst criminals . Manipulated and calculated mischievous cry from so few that thought they were the chosen ones, a sense of narcissistic, arrogant, conceited, vain, personality was developed and exonerated by so few in the percentile of most other criminal and substandard human behaviors . The money had all disappeared but having been the imaginary dream of euphoria, to be above all, suddenly found less worthy than the average . Like plagiarism, much of what you would entail, is like it should have been known so many just could not remember, many simpletons were given free cable and satellite television, infomercials only sponged up small traces of wealth, it was the main programming that was meant to hurt the masses, repeating simple programming, which made everybody that was stuck in the realm happy. Happy as listening to old rock 'n roll music; playing the same notes over and over, echoing the same words as presented in the first six words of the song. Joyful as singing Christmas carols during the stolen holiday of the many gospel leaders before Jesus Christ's time . Celebrating Easter not as a risen life instead a celebration of new life not ever being given a chance, instead of enjoying Summerland, the land which most used to need for the hope of eternal life . A disease of the mind so few recognized the coming almost comparable to playing games of chance and luck fit such a small percentage . Doing as they please and adorn, the choices are their own and having AI to fill in any blanks with any question answered at a whim . No longer can a specific leader or group can influence, lobby, misguide the population . Every single law was under review and only the laws voted for by the majority exist which made everything quite understandable, purposeful, and proper . Everybody works to their most desirable limitations and are no longer limited to receive a limitation of their worldly needs . Brought together in this new era, for one good reason, which must be read between the lines . Many of the old ways are no longer in existence, as the core of the problem had been solved. About the percentage of scientific discoveries that were proven true is about the same percentage of most of the assorted kinds of criminal human behavior, under 3% of the past worlds we once knew . Joyous excitement, the pizzazz of grandeur, humbled is no longer recognized, fulfillment of social degree and institutionalized care with unformidable creed are some of the normal characteristics which were not left behind . Peace Officers are relinquished to a proper stature, the need for militant advice is no longer a priority . The police commission is completely dissolved there is no need to run a country with underpaid criminals . Shady Blue strategy is now illegal, truth is not remembered from all in history, no special lobbying is allowed, exempting needs for the most vulnerable . Laws are rewritten to follow majority rule unlike the past, criminology is dealt a total remake. Hundred percent forensics remotely completed with AI . Artificial intelligence takes over much of the end of bureaucracy, with all the data collected . The struggle to not give out any data lost Its battle when a continuous loop of information was being handled remotely . Notable to an average person would have been the commercials on television have been deleted . A collection of all the small talk became prominent . News casts have been eliminated . Entertaiment has been relinquished to only a passive crew of elderly, handicapped, hospitalized, resting patrons of Music and Visual Documentaries and movies & shows with no censorship . Outdoor activities are quite prominent. Sports are played out for the attendees, other competitions are changed to fit a knowledgeable gain, wildlife conservation and observation are key . The few that abide by the program survive, prominently . Least used information would only be brought up on demand. A scheduled reminder is programmed . Brainwashing only becomes apparent when it was misinformation that was justified to be improper and not made for use of any kind . Need for greed no longer exists . Automobiles, transportation vehicles of all sorts including buses, trains, airplanes, and ships that use oil byproducts became forbidden . The cost of putting in separate pods for isolation was not a way to go forward with transporting in the capsule-rocket was the elite way to get around for all distant travel, the shortest of runs would not be much shorter timewise as would be the less than instant time needed for any travel . Leaving all lands free of highways and byways except for walking paths . All new building and structures are built with helical piles to absorb earthquake motion, steel tubes are driven under the foundation of a solid fiber reinforced concrete slab for most simple cases, not averting any traffic or fauna . Geothermal is brought to a new level, hydrogeology used for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall . It has been years now since the world polluters have stopped and all the assets were used to make a carbon free admission atmosphere . Most of the existing remnants are not completely trashed, a re-usage is in for the plan of redevelopment with the ingenuity of for-thought for distant futuristic values . One might simply ask what triggered these precarious phenomena of the new revolution, it was not easy to recognize it was an evolution of learning propriety's, it simply was educating humanity to live within the Earth's standard realms, appropriateness to the purpose . Understanding the circumstances that are most prevalent to the majority of all (humans) Hominine, (animals) Metazoic, no intervention is necessary to bring the wildlife to a standard, the true blue was always, one could say it is in front of every one of us . All we must do was look up, up, and down, down, looking behind was quite a waste of time, history only repeated itself when envisioned by hypocritical historians paid by the wealthiest to commit treason and murder raping the populations of the true dignity and deserving wealth of humanity, and biology, alongside of all the flora and fauna . If you did not look up or down when you are moving forward, you missed the earth’s ship . The poignant dignity of each human is treasured like never, the value has finally taken charge, the rewards are most gratifying for every single being, the slowest is right beside the fast, the strongest always helping the weakest, the smartest are never working alone, friendship has a whole new meaning with love shared all around . Biology is finally accepted as the true evolution, much easier to prove without an imaginary dream, more simply recognized as the only possibility . Like an electrifying ninth wonder, flourishing becomes quite natural, (plants) Viridiana the forested zones are managed differently, simply tended on an outlook for the future . Illegal to cultivate as done in the past, now recognized as a miscalculated imbecilic need for the elusive money grab which never liquidated to a standard never mind a substandard mentality . The Clean-up is all done by corporate workers that once sat at desks in skyscrapers looking down on 99% of the population that they were hired to help, paying a debt for making improper decisions, only permitted to enslave each other, and regulated by the people that were once the poorest, all the farmers and their helpers . Wildflowers flourish through all the countryside, as many of the insects, the honeybees are all exonerated producing a natural remedy, from the unequivocal hemp production for all the natural products used within the domiciles, and habitats of the domesticated livestock . The main aquifers are typically unconsolidated alluvium, composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes and generate new deposits for agriculture and systemic filtration . Solar, wind, and earth's internal energies are the only fuels licensed by law . Even all the dams are dismantled and put back to an absolute natural state yet overflow water can be tunneled for a small-scale hydroelectric generation . This water is all used for human consumption and necessities once it had passed through . Pipelines are used for needed water usages, using aquifer as the main stem . The fear and anxiety are forever replaced with Love and Ernest, until a time the mistakes arise . Who would ever make a guess the development of humankind and earth could be one? How could such a simple concluding phrase be overlooked; fidelity will carry on . Each must do what will better their glorious short life. Not measured with gold nor Gods, simply calculated in the biosphere . Since all oil products have been long gone everything seems to be different people do not need to have all those plastic shiny things now, they are manufactured without any oil byproducts and the automobiles of every sort of electric rigs, trains, buses, rockets and personal transit . To stop using the battery-operated system in a very short time because it is quite inevitable, but this was another cartel scheme . Earth is covered in magnetic waves capsulizing on rolling poles, the thunderstorms that produce vast amounts of lightning may be contained, along with the reins the winds can really drum up and this could be good for a local windmill the best and most reliable motion of the oceans is a great phenomenon . The solar energy could be collected in specific latitudes of the earth a South of California all the way to northern Chile has a large effect so this would include Australia for sure and Africa so very good concentration in South America, this solar collection is best in these areas because of your round tilt of the earth as it rotates . To contain regulated alternating current and voltage is already done in the highline wires and could be brought down to a usable area like along a highway or railway or delivered to homes and businesses via induction so all you would need is a coded pick-up device . The idea of rockets to travel a distance instead of fuel consuming airplanes with an archaic design, or a preliminary idea of what would ascertain if one wanted to travel from Canada to England the rocket would go on the exact angle and elevation would be calculated to put it on angle to go basically but would feel like straight up and then straight down as we already have the design to land a rocket, the design of motivation may not be electrical as in many other necessities but it surely could be done with a hydrogen fuel rocket engine . Instead of putting people six feet in the earth to go to heaven why are we not blasting people off into outer space to scatter their ashes in the outer atmosphere and then they can look down at the people on earth and when the people on earth want to look up into the heavens, they may get some dust in their eyes . History, the key to the disastrous and challenging mistakes or could be called lessons have not been learned, like the following of the tyrants of political gains, forming all for the means of having more imaginary money with the false advertising for an easement of a fancy life which do not contain any majority of people . The tycoons of the specific cartels have simply gambled on people following and believing in them blindly . Developing various Darius, Julius, more than just precarious, ignoring the most serious groups that or profound majority or simply 50% + 1 . As was regulated with notes pertaining to true conservativeship, the vote was always to be 50% or more of the population not particularly the vote of political leaders . A republican view information could be filled with many lies as possible on television channels throughout United States of America for the new primaries . With some tidying up of our vote, one may want a republican conservativeship . One may not look for all the reasons that another is wrong but instead look for all the reasons that another is in cahoots with, this would limit all the redundancy, this would be a regulation of what needs to be done . It is quite simply sad that we cannot agree on everything and the worst of all is arguing about something from a different perspective not only a different view but a completely opposite or irrelevant set of beliefs and reasons to be heard first and not any time to listen without even having a similar topic . Political gains are derived on having a disorder, is there really a reason that to have to give something good up to have a collection of points so that you may have something to gain that is in ultimate disagreement with another group of a similar society . To gain something that is devastating to the earth and not living with the earth in all its glory, the evolution must move on . Lawyers and politicians alike could be raided, rated to not have any votes from many people . The leadership could folly by not having enough votes to lead, and the cabinets kept, and be filled with the lawyers that only have a lesser percentage to finally fall off the scale would make sometimes a short road to the end of their career . Like resigning with loss of confidence from party members except by votes, not waiting for a shenanigan display, bartering, trading political gains, excluding further lobbyists ."},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

For me, finding my life purpose was a process of trial and error. I tried out different things, paid attention to what made me feel most alive and fulfilled, and kept exploring until I found something that felt like a perfect fit. It wasn't an overnight epiphany; it was a gradual unfolding that took place over many years. But eventually, I realized that my life purpose is to help others find their own path in life. This could mean coaching them, mentoring them, or simply being a sounding board for their ideas – whatever form it takes, I feel called to help others in this way. If you're wondering how to find your own life purpose, my best advice is to start by paying attention to what lights you up and makes you feel most alive.

Inland taipan:The venom of the Inland Taipan is extremely potent and is rated as the most toxic of all snake venoms in LD50 tests on mice. As well as being strongly neuro-toxic the venom contains a 'spreading factor' (hyaluronidase enzyme) that increases the rate of absorption. Now finally the deadly microbes The most dangerous microbes for humans are those that are easily transmitted, virulent and invasive to central organs like the blood and lung, robust survivors in the environment, have a low infection dose and are without any specific treatment or vaccine. Most of them are zoo-noses transmitted from animals and often with insects as vectors. The most dangerous microbes cause a very high mortality, are identified as high-risk agents or “bio hazard-level 4” agents and are treated at the highest level of infection protection with strict isolation measures. Dangerous microbes occur as a problem mostly in countries with low hygiene standards/high population density and in tropical-subtropical areas. Infection control must always be based on hygienic measures and strict infection protection.

I’m not sure. In my own mind, noon is a point in time. A moment of zero duration. It occurs as the wall clock hand passes over the 12. Ditto for midnight. Story time. I worked on the railroad as a control tower operator. One of my functions was to copy down train orders from the displatcher and hand the orders up to the train crew as they passed by my tower. This was in single-main-line territory in Kansas. A train order would typically tell the train crew where they should meet an opposing train that is running against them on the same line. The order would direct the westbound train to go into a siding track, at one of several possible towns, where that train would wait until after the eastbound train had passed in the opposite direction. Both train crews had a copy the orders. The order specified the meeting times for each train, for each of several towns. It was expressed as, “Eastbound train, do not pass city C1 before time T1. Do not pass city T2 before time T2. And so on.” Those were contraints on the eastbound train. Then the westbound crew had to decide which town they could reach, and still have time to enter the siding, and close the switches, and still have 10 minutes to spare. So the questioner reminded me of a certain railroad rule regarding 12 noon and 12 midnight. The rule avoids exactly that possible misunderstanding about 12:00. The rule says the train order cannot mention 12:00 am nor 12:00 pm. The train order can say 11:59 am or 12:01 pm (daytime). Or it can say 11:59 pm or 12:01 am (nighttime). But it cannot say 12:00."},{"instruction":"What is the best thing I can do before I die?","output":"You must learn two things before you die : -1 - Learn to give others2- Learn the art of forgiveness.

There is, in any case, an elective that could likewise merit considering—renting. Renting accompanies some particular focal points and disservices when contrasted and buying, so whether renting a car is a smart thought relies upon your own individual conditions, driving inclinations and monetary circumstance. How Does Leasing a Car Work? Whether or not to lease or purchase a car is somewhat like leasing versus buying a home. Leasing or renting may be simpler to swing monetarily consistently, however will require a few concessions you wouldn't make in any case. On the off chance that you purchase a car, you're allowed to utilize it as you please. You'll additionally be on the snare to pay for any adjusting or fixes that aren't under guarantee. In the event that a car is financed, you'll own it by and large once your advance is paid off. At the point when you presently don't need it, it's yours to sell or exchange. At the point when you lease a car, you don't claim it—you pay an expense to drive it for a set term, regularly two to four years. You consent to a lease arrangement with the lessor, ordinarily through a car business, and you may need to pay a forthright expense. Notwithstanding, this charge is normally substantially less than the up front installment you'd pay to back a car or what it would cost to purchase a car out and out. During your lease, you'll make regularly scheduled installments for a set timeframe and must stick to specific standards remembered for your lease understanding. You may, for instance, be restricted in the quantity of miles you can drive the car every year, and face a charge on the off chance that you go over that limit. The lease arrangement will likewise indicate what's under guarantee and who is responsible for maintenance and adjusting for costs not covered by the guarantee. In certain leases, the renter is answerable for these costs, while in others, the lessor pays for them. You ought to consistently ensure you understand what you are and aren't liable for monetarily. What Are the Benefits of Leasing a Car? Renting a car has potential advantages that may speak to certain drivers: Lower regularly scheduled installments: Monthly installments for a car lease are generally lower than month to month car advance installments, so renting could mean going through less cash every month to drive a similar car. (By and large, month to month lease installments for the ten most-leased car models is 102 less expensive than advance installments (with some being as much as 150 to 200 less expensive).More modest initial installment: Car leases regularly require a forthright charge, yet they're commonly not as much as what you'd pay for a car advance initial installment. On the off chance that money is tight for you, renting could assist you with managing the cost of a car sooner.New-car experience: If it's critical to you to drive fresher cars, a lease can make this more reasonable than buying. Since leases typically simply last two to four years, you can continually move up to new cars with the most recent wellbeing and innovation highlights. You can evaluate various cars all the more regularly, and since the vehicles are fresher and you just have them for a couple of years, they might be less inclined to mechanical issues.Diminished problem: If you own a car and at this point don't need or need it, you need to sell it or exchange it, which can be a serious agony. At the point when you lease, upon the end date, you essentially return the vehicle.Some took care of expenses: With fresher leased cars, the guarantee may cover any issues you run into. Furthermore, in certain leases, the lessor will pay for overhauling or car issues not covered by the guarantee. This isn't generally the situation, however on the off chance that your lease takes care of these costs, you can try not to pay for car issues (however you'll likely need to pay for routine maintenance, for example, oil changes and new tires).

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","output":"After many many years with ancient Greek studying i can say something that that will shake many users: Modern Greek is only a part of a big whole, named as Greek language. ! ! ! First of all modern Greek is denoted in ordinary books or every day life discussions as a different language. Modern Greek is not a language, it is one of the hundreds of the Greek dialects that have existed through the millennia of the existence of the Greek language in general. The same is valid for example for Koine, the langua….😉 sorry, i mean the dialect that Bible was written in, as Koine is a dialect not a language mentioned today in a wrong full way. Imagine that Plotin, approx 2nd century AD, has written in his remarkable work ENNEADES that the Greek language of his time was quite different than the more “ancient” versions because ….. … Plotin continues by explaining why( i will not say more here). So, Plotin at his time experienced the sense of what modern Greek is today compared to ancient classic Greek , namely the modern Greek language has become a dialect of something older. Today many Greek youth speak a language that is developed through the new ways of socializing, most socializing done through digital media. (the same is happening all over the world). If an ordinary Greek youngster wants really to communicate with its grandparents then i guess that the grandparents will have many questions on many unknown modern Greek words or modern Greek sentences that becomes difficult to understand as the Greek phrases have an other syntax and many words an other meaning. For example Malakas (a famous word😉) is a swear word today that exists in ancient Greek but then beard a completely different meaning. The modern youth are on the way to make a new Greek dialect. The Greek language has a noticeable characteristic namely that it is well described through the centuries as the Greeks were very active in writing and thus leaving many documents through time. Let me put in this a way that will be represented as dialects through a time-line of the Greek language and its evolution in a casual way as this is matter is suitable for a PhD and post PhD thesis. Very superficial, under you can see the many Dialects(all together becomes the Greek language ) of the Greek language through the millennia almost in a time line order : Minoan, Mycinean, Ionian(Minor Asia , science Greek), Dorian, Koritnthian, Aeolian, Cypriot,(lets say, this the a border line between the archaic and the classic that follows ) Athenian(classic), Magna Grecian, Macedonian, Spartan etc etc etc , …,(A new era that is more under Christian influence)Neoplatonic, Koine, Early Byzantine, Middle Byzantine, Late Byzantine(This is a new era after the fall of Constantinople), Pontiac, Urum, Fanariotika(Rum), Tsakonika, Thraciotika, Kritika, Kapadokian, Karamanlidika, , Arvanitika, Egyptiotika, Eptanisiaka, Dodekanisiaka, Ipirotika, Roumeliotika, Vlahika, etc.(lets say the following is the pure modern Greek line)demotiki, kathareyousa, etc etc etc Lets say all that is mentioned above are put in a real time line(actually is not…) and try to go back in time. The first thing that you are going to notice is that there differences from significant ones to huge differences in all Greek dialects between them.! Meaning that : If you speak pure demotiki and try to understand pure kathareuousa that both belongs to the same time line(pure modern Greek) is going to be quite difficult to understand it. Even to understand a Cypriot when he/she speaks pure Cypriot is difficult, the same can happen with a person form Crete or from Tsakonia etc etc Now, if you are a modern Greek and try to understand a text that goes back a step in the described time line, i.e from the fall of Constantinople until the modern times you will discover very fast that the most of the cases it will be relatively easy or acceptable to manage to read and understand a text. BUT, sometimes it will be almost impossible as many texts from many dialects developed especially at that era are very different to understand for a modern Greek. For example Kapadokian Greek uses Greek in a inflict way(Ionian ancient Greek words) and at the same time they use turkish words among their speech as this dialect developed in kappadokia that lys in modern Turkey. If you go more back in time in the era of the Byzantine times up to classicism there are many texts that are very difficult to understand because of many different technical reasons. All modern Greeks can read texts from this era but the meaning starts to be different than that of the main Greek language. For example many texts have a religious and Philosophical character and this mixture can be difficult to understand as it is a new way of expression for this era. I will use a very strange example for the most of the Greeks: This era is based most on its Christian character. It is well known the Greek expression Kyrie Eleison. The Christians through Koine copied many ancient Greek words and sayings but they lack to use them in a correct way as they couldn't understand always ancient Greek well at that time. The Roman-Christians had closed all ancient Philosophic Greek schools. So, Kyrie Eleison comes from a Greek ancient philosophic mentality that was ment to mean Kyrie enlighten us as Eleison comes from Eleon( in Greek in general means Oil) that means in ancient Greek Oil and Light at the same time as Oli contains light(drink Olive Oil…!!!). Even the tree that produces Eleon(oil) is called Elea(olive tree) but in ancient Greek means Light.(all these things can be found in Plotin and Plutarch). The modern Greeks and the Byzantine Greeks when they said Kyrie Eleison they ment God give us some oil!!! But the right meaning is God enlighten us!!! See how complicated is with the Greek dialects and its phrase and words through the millennia. (Even the name Hellen(that is related to Eleison)and was abducted by Troy means the Enlighten…) The same can be said for a modern Geek trying to understand texts older that the Byzantine as the classical and the archaic ones. All ancient words exists even today in Modern Greek but either those have an other meaning or have lost their meaning as for example the ancient word Lysiteles. All modern, literally all, modern Greeks can read and in a way understand this word but they are not sure of its original meaning. (Lysis tou Telous) meaning the freedom of a process that has a start and an End meaning even more the Soul will be free from the circle of a birth and an end as it has found its position in the Universe. Conclusion : Greek is alive now and for may millennia. Greek language keeps to be the same in when it concerns the way is written but some words have changed meaning to something new and that fact makes difficult some times for a modern Greek to understand the ancient Greek way of saying things."},{"instruction":"Every year, the top 5 mutual funds changes.

Well, isn’t this a pickle! As the employer, I have to take care of my business, and also take care of my employees. A lot depends on the nature of the business, and the nature of the geas the employee appears to be under. Let’s start with the business… If it’s something like lawyering or plumbing, my employee is kinda SOL; in addition to the usual parallels people draw between these professions, they both require frequent 1–1 meetings with clients, many of whom will turn out to be women. If this is the case, employee will have to be nudged down a different, non client-meeting track, or start looking for another job.If there are not secrecy or logistical issues involved, it may be possible to send someone along with him; in fact, I like to have two people from my organization go to meetings, in case one guy misses something. In other words, it may be possible to accommodate the employee, providing that he brings enough value to the table to make it worth dealing with this bootless drama. Let’s examine the actual geas… First off, how absolute is the prohibition? Can this employee “soldier through” for the occasional meeting, or is this a full-blown dealbreaker? What happens if he’s supposed to meet with a guy and a gal, and the guy gets sick at the last minute?Is it okay if the meeting be in a public place? Or a conference room with the door open?If I send a wingwoman with him, will the taxi ride to the site be a problem? What if there’s an elevator ride involved? That is to say, how rigid is the prohibition?How does his geas interact with the transgendered? Does it trigger off the original or target gender of the other individual? Privately, I have my doubts as to how many people have this kind of restriction. It seems like the worst form of meant-to-be-noticed public piety that just annoys everyone. Seriously, a moral married man should be able to have a meeting with a Victoria’s Secret model and just be serenely happy that his beloved wife is waiting for him somewhere, and get his frikkin job done."},{"instruction":"f Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?","output":"Because neither political party actually cares about fiscal responsibility just like neither party actually cares about illegal immigration, or the plight of blacks."},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Dropshipping] [URL: https://bestblogger001.blogspot.com/2023/06/scaling-your-dropshipping-business.html]"},{"instruction":"Does your dog ever act as if you offended him/her?","output":"Oh my yes???

CANVA [LINKED_TEXT: Canva] [URL: https://www.canva.com/] is both a free image editor, and a paid image editor. Meaning that while the basic features of Canva are free, a user has to get a 'Pro' (Paid) subscription for more advanced features.

Due to inflation, I understand that nowadays it may cost a few hundred dollars to learn TM, and that is a bargain, in my view. Don’t listen to the cynics. I have practiced TM daily for 49 years, having paid a fee of 50 (in 1974) for meditation initiation and four-day instruction.

So I would say from that viewpoint there is nothing that would qualify as being an acquired taste as all can be eaten with out upsetting the pallet from that point of view. There are possibly 3 reasons for this: 1: In the UK there is no extra Sugar or seasoning added to everything you eat. You get that choice. 2: In the UK there are none or a minimum of artificial ingredients in everything you eat. 3: The complainers have destroyed their taste buds by smoking or drinking/eating strong acidic based substances. A British Curry favourite developed from an Indian recipe, the Vindaloo, which was based on the Portuguese “Carne de vinha d'alhos”, is unlike the classic recipe which is nowhere near as hot.

I am not sure that you would need radiation since both breasts were removed. However, you may need chemotherapy or some type of therapy to keep the cancer from spreading. Surgeons do their best to remove all of the tumor but there is no guarantee that a few cells won’t be left behind or have entered your lymphatic system through your lymph nodes. I cannot give medical advice, but I feel that you should consult your oncologist and other breast cancer specialists right away to get the direction you need. Get a second opinion if you can. Not all chemo agents and biologics are the same and not every physician will have the same knowledge and expertise. Any recommendations should be tailored to your situation and your specific tumor characteristics. It may not be as bad as you think. Breast cancer therapy has really come a long way in recent years. What I explained above is based on my years of practice as a technologist working with oncology patients. Best of luck!"},{"instruction":"Why has Labour lost its fourth general election in a row?","output":"The last labour party loss was not down to any policy manifestos but essentially to Brexit. The manipulated mendacity lies and propaganda, which although was thoroughly corrupt, none the less was brilliantly maneuvered and developed as a brand mantra. Nothing to do with honesty, intentions. But solely based on the fraudulent financialization working with the right-wing media proprietors who all willingly bankroll the government. And to whom, decency, equality, justice and fairness is an anathema. Certainly, if it reduces iniquitous profits from wealth extraction by any means, that is a no-goer to them, and that means even community socialism. Labour were actually for the people, working along with the people. Not controlling it for Money, which they rarely see. The other losses, almost certainly due to the fraudulent neoliberal policies and propaganda promoted since Thatcher, and the total financialization ideology that has taken over all our lives. We have essentially all been inculcated into the belief that the only thing that matters is money and profits, and that the more money that is ‘created’ by the wealth managers and the asset speculators and the multi-billionaires at the top-of-the-pile, the more the whole country benefits. ‘And that means YOU.’ Unfortunately, this is the ‘brilliant’ myth that has been deliberately and extremely effectively concocted and promoted by the corrupt City of London, the global sewer of finance, which the neoliberal governments of all colours now call UK plc and which attracts the worst of our world’s humanity; villainous thugs and perverted filth of: wealth extraction, money grabbing: laundering, mafiosi, pornography, drugs, kidnapping, armaments, warfare, prostitution, slavery, gambling, Why is this? Because the UK plc has developed financial engineered products that are so incredibly complex that only the sleezy-whiz-kid mathematicians who developed them, only really know how they work and then they are entered into algorithms via AI that then pass through a profusion of interlaced channels and then to numerous ‘secret’ tax havens - normally British protectorate operated and disparately owned -which then result in no tax being paid, but which often - through the financial engineering - receive additional income in the tens of billions, all under the auspices of UK plc which gets commission on virtually everything. But this is then privately and strictly recirculated within the financialization circle, so the majority of citizens never see any sign of it, and the country benefits from a few crumbs of the proceeds. The freemarket system only works when it is appreciating. For when it fails it has to be bailed out, regardless of whether it destroys innocent lives. Should we really be proud of our corrupt and skewed capitalism as it has now become, or is this the only way the UK can survive? How many young people who are born into a minimum wage family, that is so low as to never get the just kind of educational opportunities; the kind of genuine educational supports to be able to realize their own capabilities and to contribute to society? That alone is a sound reason, whether or not you think of it in terms of the long-term benefit for the country,or you just approach it as a moral question, or indeed an ethical question. By what right, does a society (you/I) condemn a whole generation (probably, then begetting a further dysfunctional generation or generations) of young people to be born into families, whose financial circumstances - perhaps deliberately dictated by neoliberal governments for ideological purposes- make so much of what they truly need to become real and valuable members fundamentally impossible? If this is what corporate driven capitalism through corrupt financialization of wealth extractors avoiding taxes to leave the poorer citizens of the country ‘to-stump-up’ is all about? With oligarchs being allowed - if not willfully supported by a government regime - to dictate policies and reduce genuine democracy by a top-down policy deliberately aimed at an iniquitous and egregiously growing inequality between the asset speculator rich, and the increasingly, barely surviving, poor, then the current system is a mockery. There is currently, a virtual senate, dictated by the economic system to achieve inequality through mass debt engine policies, and thus give even further power and profits to the few. These few are mostly non- productive, depending on algorithms and ultra-high-speed trading, to create ever more wealth and power for them as private individuals. While virtually accepting that it is necessary to enslave the true productive workforce through low wages, threats of unemployment through robotics etc. And reduced human rights is the only way for the economic system to flourish. Profit is always privatized, but all expenses and business setbacks or incompetency conveniently left to the individual to bare (even when they are told -at short notice they are redundant) or this, then transferred through the specious tax system to the public purse. This inevitably means, the mass and poorer section of society having to take the brunt of any downturn caused by the billionaire oligarchs and the multi millionaire asset- speculators in the first place, with their overriding need to suppress wages and continually extract debt. But through this perverted policy, they are destroying the environment and the planet because their Money God of profit is the be-all-and-end-all of existence and the so-called free-markets must be allowed to thrive. So much for \\"We are all in this together!' It is time for a fresh approach before it is too late. As others have said; Liberty, Fraternity and Equality should be the mantra of society, but capitalism is a serious obstacle to this. For meritocracy is a fabrication of both capitalism and the few; to ensure the mass of the people are failures, even though, they, in too many cases, are equally qualified and indeed more often than not the only truly wealth producers maintaining the country through their honesty and declared taxes. This is the corrupt system which currently predominates and is destroying basic democratic rights of the many. Economically, politically and socially, the people must be integrated. There is currently far too much political distortion. All employment should have: status, dignity, self-respect and the genuine ability to participate fully in society. Corporate capitalism distorts the truth of employment and the true wealth of the country. Buying back stock inflates the stock market and qualitative easing and low interest rates manipulates actual capital worth. Government statistics are dangerously manipulated and supported by right-wing billionaire wealth-extractor proprietors. Profits are made by the workforce but their wages are decided by the 1% and the 1% (or so) take the profits and give away as little as possible.The 1%, being the principal shareholders and the board of directors - who in many cases are one and the same - They also arbitrarily decide on the salary and bonuses of the board of directors and senior management. The system is fundamentally corrupt, undemocratic and unstable. DEMOCRACY AT WORK - CAPITALISM REVISITED - DEMOCRATIZE THE ENTERPRISE. Democratize the enterprise through collective enterprise: Expel the board of directors, after which the workers collectively decide: hiring, firing, evaluating the managers. The highest pay is no more than 8-1 of the lowest paid personnel. All personnel have a fair share-interest in the company which is their absolute right. The true value (not the inflated value) of the company is independently determined and then owned by the state - e.g. all the people who are the true workers and are per-se the state, finance and own this. However, one third of the new value is given by the state to the original investors.. Oligarchical totalitarianism and diminishing democracy leading to disenfranchisement will be proceeding to its close. The 'free'-market system will be dictated by the consumer and not solely by the 1% and if it fails, so be it! The liquidity of the country's finances through the mass of the people being paid a generous amount for a productive days work, should increase exponentially in itself, through the ability of many more being in a position to liberally spend for products and services. Renewed pride in every area of society should replace a debt-fueled and driven criminally credit extraction, with many citizens barely able to exist, nation. All the people will dictate the policy of the country for their own advancement and that of the country, rather than politicians with their own dubious party agenda and for personal aggrandizement, paid for by a corrupt 1% in return for favors to acquire more riches and power....and a true democracy will be reborn. The anti neo-conservative section of politicians should be independent who vote according to their conscience rather than be affiliated - and consequently be in the power- of a corrupt party system only interested in their own ideology. This should provide the opportunity of welcoming the previously not eligible-to-vote-young, who will be our country of the future. They must have confidence that they will be treasured and looked after, and considered a vital element of policy which will be a genuinely fresh approach to politics (preferably also via Proportional Representation). The welfare of the planet and our country must take priority ahead of profits. Caring for one another, and ensuring the community takes precedence over commercial interests. Allow corruption and capitalism to be a thing of the past. Take courage and show that integrity and decency and genuine concern for the good of all the country is what matters. The young - and many others, will follow in droves. The Media are run by ardent capitalists who most care for profit over anything, they dissemble most things for their own purposes. This country should not be obsessed with shoddy quantity work but for quality in all things. There will be a time if this route is followed when we can at last be true to our principles, And not be dependent on neoliberal governments that don’t care for their people but are only interested in ever more profits for unwanted, unsustainable consumerism, which is supporting equally unsustainable, disastrously polluting business and their wealth extractors who skillfully avoid paying tax via tax havens and financial engineering product, to enable them to build ever greater private wealth and power, which the majority of the people or indeed the country never see."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

The thinking proces is a proces where an impuls from the the state of pure consciousness enters the mind and becomes a concrete thought. Through the means of perception this thought becomes a concrete object in awareness. Pure consciousness is the state of awareness of total inner silence. It can be experienced as total silence, total light, total darkness, but the main property is “just existence without any form of activity”. It is the total potential of all not yet emerged energy. An electromagnetic wave, or other type of energy fluctuation, can be seen as the total potential of that type of energy. An electron is the collapse of the electromagnetic wave. The wavefunction is the state where everything (of that wave) is in total harmony, or coherence. At the moment an observation takes place, individual consciousness brakes the coherence of the wavefunction, which results in the perception of an object.

The only thing on the farm with less intelligence is a sheep… dumber than dirt sheep are. Goats are very friendly, we often go on walks with them and sit and read while they browse. Goats are very intelligent and easy to keep as long as you have a good goat shed and room to store lots of hay for the winter (about 50, 40lb bales per adult goat). Both chickens and goats make fertilizer for the garden. The chicken manure has to compost for a year before use. When we hatch out new peeps (chickens just out of the egg) they are extremely cute and we enjoy watching them. The baby goats are one of the most adorable creatures on earth and we often sit with them in our lap while watching TV to get them used to humans at a young age. The goats think you are part of the herd and consider you a fellow goat. Good pets for most folks are dogs and cats, not farm animals. We eat ours and use the milk and eggs.

While the rovers are designed for a few months of service to complete their primary mission objectives, they often continue functioning for years afterward (beyond their warranties, if you will). Understandably, years of service across rough terrain takes its toll on wheels that were only designed to reliably survive for a few months on the Martian surface. The Mars 2020 rover is also a larger, heavier robotic laboratory than any previous rovers, so an upgrade was anticipated. According to NASA: “Engineers redesigned the Mars 2020 wheels to be more robust due to the wear and tear the Curiosity rover wheels endured while driving over sharp, pointy rocks. Mars 2020's wheels are narrower than Curiosity's, but bigger in diameter and made of thicker aluminum. The combination of the larger instrument suite, new Sampling and Caching System, and modified wheels makes Mars 2020 heavier than its predecessor, Curiosity.”"},{"instruction":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","output":"I visited Bhutan 3 months ago.

While an upright bike has you hunched over the handlebars, a recumbent bike encourages better spinal posture.Recumbent bikes are gentle on all your joints. Your lower back is supported by the bucket seat and your knees and ankles are protected from potential injurious impact.The fact that the seat is larger on a recumbent bike tends to be one of the most enticing features. An upright bike generally has a smaller seat and can be uncomfortable for many riders.Recumbent [LINKED_TEXT: Indoor Exercise bikes] [URL: https://trustorereview.com/top-5-indoor-exercise-bike-reviews/] are generally safer because you cannot stand up on the pedals. This eliminates many of the injuries that occur when using an upright bike.A [LINKED_TEXT: stationary exercise bikes] [URL: https://trustorereview.com/top-best-stationary-exercise-bikes-reviews/] is a good choice for most people with neurological conditions since the bike provides a workout for individuals of all ability levels. It is safe and provides a low impact total body workout.Due to the low impact the recumbent bike reduces the risk of pain and can build strength. If your back and hips are affected by rheumatoid arthritis, a recumbent bike may be easier to use due to the reclining position with your weight spread over your back and buttocks. Upright Bike Benefits An upright bike gives you a more consistent workout when relating to outdoor riding, since the upright places the rider in a similar body position.Upright bikes also ensure you’re working the same muscles that are using with outdoor riding, which is more of a whole body exercise. Where as a recumbent mostly requires use of your glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves and tibilais anterior muscles.The upright bike works the abdominal muscles since you are keeping the body upright and supporting your workout. Since you are in a reclined position on a recumbent bike there is little to no use of the abdominal muscles.There is also more of an upper body arm workout since you are engaging the biceps, triceps, and shoulders in the upright position.Upright bikes have a smaller footprint, therefore take up less space in your home or gym.

It is CRITICAL that when/IF you ever lose your pedal and have a little bit of braking at the bottom of the pedal travel to make certain to stand on that pedal & NOT PUMP your brakes. Pumping the pedal isn’t going to fix a leak issue and you lose more fluid each & every single time you apply/release the brakes. Going on the assumption that you have 0% braking power available to your foot, the 1st thing to do is to SLOWLY/STEADILY apply your parking (or emergency, whatever you call it) brake until that is applied as far or as hard as you can physically engage it. Almost simultaneously you will want to begin downshifting, even if you have an automatic transmission. Though an automatic is nowhere near as effective at slowing/stopping any vehicle, most modern computer controlled transmissions/transaxles will allow you to drop the shifter directly into 1st/low gear as it will begin downshifting but will not allow the trans to downshift so quickly that you’ll possibly damage the engine or lock up the drive wheels. The final aspect about losing your brakes no one ever realizes is this…..PICK WHAT YOU HIT! Assuming you don’t have enough room to get the car slowed enough to get it completely stopped, you ALWAYS can determine WHAT you will run into. That can be a HUGE DECISION…..do you run into the mother on the sidewalk with her young child, the car directly in front of you or a tree you can reach before the other two? The tree is the right answer as you’re not putting anyone else at risk aside from yourself and your passengers. If you’re on the highway you can almost guarantee you’ll have room to stop on the side of the rod unless you’re REALLY having a bad day and there’s a guy changing a flat blocking you from the side of the road. This is actually very worthwhile knowledge to EVERYONE who lives in the rustbelt, RSPECIALLY in states that use salt, calcium-chloride & other chemicals that literally dissolve brake lines, frames, body panels etc etc as that is the most likely way BY FAR you’ll ever encounter a sudden loss of braking power. My last input on this that I see as a professional tech/mechanic is that your STEERING IS FAR MORE CRITICAL, compared to your brakes for the reason that if you lose your brakes, you still get to determine what you’ll hit if you don’t have enough room to slow down enough to stop the car…but if you lose your steering (tie rod fails, spring breaks & shreds a tire etc etc) you’d be lucky to have enough time to bless yourself….most likely you’ll be completely out of control with no way possible to correct that issue in time to prevent an accident/collision, roll over or worse. Just keep that in mind the next time you take your vehicle in to be serviced!If you drive a 2ws vehicle, odds are you won’t even come close to dealing with worn out chassis/suspension parts that can cause a catastrophic failure until you run up 80–100k+++ miles OR 5–7 years. Japanese cars are even better (American cars have also radically improved compared to the 90’s) and you might not experience a single piece of your steering linkage exhibit any wear whatsoever. Those of you who INSIST on driving 4wd/AWD vehicles, (especially “the best selling pick-up 40+ years in the running) very well might see lower ball joint issues in under a year, almost always while the truck is still under the factory warranty! This isn’t meant to be a knock on any particular brand or vehicle, just real world experience. 4wd/AWD vehicles COST DRAMATICALLY MORE to repair and require servicing far more frequently than 2wd vehicles. Keep that in mind the next time you are ready to buy a vehicle…sure, you can cover the monthly payments, but I’d definitely research what it costs per mile to drive every vehicle I’d consider, though acquiring that information would be rather difficult for everyone outside of the auto service industry."},{"instruction":"w do I know if I don’t believe in God?","output":"Let us assume that an unfathomable calamity strikes your life and you have no wherewithal to face it either on your own or with any other person's help.

How can they navigate accurately knowing the position they are? Similarly, how can subs avoid collision with seamounts and rocky outcrops?","output":"The technology the submarines use was derived from a bat. Bats, over the course of centuries, if not melania, developed a way to fly, in or outside, of their environments, which are typically caves and other hides in the like. You’re probably already familiar with the word “sonar”, which is essentially a means of send pulses, and when those pulses “hit or make contact” with something, the unobservable waves bounce off the object and return to the sender, ultimately providing a very accurate reading of distance between two objects. Just like bats, submarines can’t see, so they rely on these sonar pulses to provide the feedback they need. If you’ve ever seen the movie, “The Hunt for Red October”, when Sean Connery asks for “one ping… one ping only”, immediately before he says “verify range to target”, which is how the sound of the ping is sent in all directions returning with a varied sound to indicate size, distance and movement. This is exactly how bats maneuver through their lives. Sonar is somewhat of an easy construct to grasp, but it’s significantly more complicated when you get into building something that takes on the properties of a species that paved the way to the development of sonar. You could spend the next week researching sonar and how it works, as could I, but I think this should answer your question. If you’re a glutton for technical intricacies, there is more than enough on the web about sonar, all the way up to what is classified, i.e. you’re not going to be able to find any details of a nuclear powered Ohio Class submarine that carries twenty nuclear missiles, each of which have five nuclear warheads. You might find it interesting to do a bit of hunting and gathering about the Ohio Class, the Los Angels Class and other submarines. The shift to nuclear powered submarines has truly made these machines the most lethal transport ever devised by man - especially when you consider the fact that they don’t need to refuel for 20 years and can park themselves 200 miles off the coast of any continent, making it the most formidable first strike apparatus we have ever witnessed."},{"instruction":"Are there any planets outside of our solar system?","output":"Yes, rogue planets do exist"},{"instruction":"My friend stole a Steam card and it wasn't scanned at the till.

This is basically god, I don’t even have to go in depth about this because it is crystal clear why. Hands down, he can annihilate the entire universe while playing basketball with a clone of himself. 2. Protege. This kid is insane. The only argument I have to give here is that he can replicate any sort of that he sees. So if let’s say, he sees any single character from the Marvel Universe uses one of their powers in front of him, he’ll be able to reproduce that power but twice more powerful. He was not defeated. He couldn’t be defeated. He was only captured by Pre Retcon Beyonder who is probably in top 5 most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe too, and once he escaped he started battling the Beyonder. Once the Beyonder realized that this kid is invincible, dipped. 3. Marquis of Death The Marquis of Death is the future version Clyde Wyncham. Clyde himself is an interpretation of the reader, yes, you. He is that kid at school that will tell you that he’ll call Thor to strike you down. But don’t laugh, he’ll actually do it. And if he decides he’s gotten bored of seeing you be destroyed by Thor, he can make Thor blip out of existence. In order to defeat this guy, the whole Marvel Universe had to fight against him. The Marvel Universe had to find a way to convince Clyde Wnycham to come and fight the Marquis of Death. But Clyde was defeated by him. It was only then, that after a million years of training, Doom managed to defeat the Marquis of Death, only for the Marquis to tell Doom that he allowed this thing to happen. This is my top 5. It is highly debatable, I think Marquis can actually beat Protege if he takes him from behind and whoops him out of existence.

But lets consider even it did then- India, being a developing and emerging market, will not be able to take advantage of labor cost arbitration. Labor cost arbitration is a factor due to which developed economies outsource manufacturing and services to emerging markets because its cheaper to produce there. India has many thriving outsourcing industries like BPO, IT, Pharma. India already has so much poverty and lack of proper jobs an equilisation of dollar and rupee will worsen the situation. It is probably in the best interests of Indian economy to see a gradual depreciation and develop the domestic economy.

However, the real reason would be that the supplier could not ensure a supply chain that followed Fennovoima’s published ethical code of conduct, quoted below. “Ethical requirements apply to all suppliers of the Hanhikivi 1 project Full compliance with all applicable laws,Prohibition of all corruptive behavior,Occupational safety in all operations,Respect for human rights,Environmental compliance and sustainability actions.” Fennovoima requires the above from the entire supply chain. One or more of the supply chain companies did not meet the “full compliance with all applicable laws” when they accepted the transfer of ownership and managing the nuclear facilities at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia. The Ukrainian courts considers this to be in breach of the law, and thus the supplier to the Hanhikivi 1 project, by accepting ownership and/or management, would be in breach of Fennovoima’s first ethical requirement. One or more of the supply chain companies did not meet the “Occupational safety in all operations”, the transfer of operations of Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia was done very chaotically. Despite the uncertain and chaotic situation, one or more of the supply chain companies involved accepted to take over the management and operations of nuclear sites without ensuring an orderly and safe transfer of management. While managing one or more of the above sites, the companies did not make any effort to establish communications with the IAEA. Also see “full compliant with laws” above regarding communciation. “Environmental compliance and sustainability actions”, whilst managing the Chernobyl nuclear location, one or more supply chain companies failed to inform people operating in the area of the dangers of radiation. There was a failure of maintaining adequate safety distances from areas polluted by radiation. There are no records that any of the involved supply chain companies made any attempts to warn people in contaminated areas of the dangers. There were also other issues, such as that contact has been lost with the factory that had been approved to manufacture the reactor pressure vessel. It would take significant time to certify another factory, or recertify the previous one, to manufacture the pressure vessel, which would further delay the project. IN SUMMARY: One or more of the suppliers in the supply chain breached several of Fennovoima’s (the purchaser) rules of conduct. It could be said that the suppliers made a series of bad choices in accepting the transfer of ownership and/or control of a number of sites without first ensuring that it could be done safely and in an organized and orderly way. The buyer (Fennovoima) has decided that they don’t want to do business unless their supplier meets their rather simple and lenient standards, which were breached on several accounts."},{"instruction":"Ernst & Young agreed to pay a record 100 million fine and to admit that some of its auditors cheated on required ethics exams in recent years.

How does someone who grew up in a dysfunctional family supposed to magically treat themselves with love and respect?","output":"You can’t correct relationship issues from a dysfunctional family upbringing “magically” or quickly. This is work to be done over time, layer by layer, memory and event by memory and event. You’ll look at your early attachments, for example, as causes - and you’ll begin to relate differently toward yourself incrementally. Shame and emotional pain is slowly replaced with compassion love and respect toward your Self. Many dynamics, beliefs and traits toward yourself change in time. Yes, learning to love yourself is also about loving others. This will be a part of a therapy that treats you. In the course of this you will learn compassion, forgiveness when you are ready (it comes later, not sooner), that you aren’t a “bad, wrong or damaged” person stuck with these for the rest of your life. You are wounded, not damaged."},{"instruction":"Were WW2 mosquito pilots really labelled as crazy?","output":"I do not believe so. The De Havilland Mosquito was a very good fighter-bomber aircraft.

[LINKED_TEXT: 10 Things Everyone Forgot About The De Havilland Mosquito] [URL: https://www.hotcars.com/de-havilland-mosquito-facts/] Maybe you think that the Mosquito pilots were crazy for the daylight, low level bombing raids that they did? I think the poor B-24 pilots and crews were more crazy with the bombing raids on the Ploesti oil fields in Romania. They should have used Mosquitos instead. B-24 over Ploesti. The Mosquitos were so fast (640 km/h or 400 mph) that even Adolf Galland stated in his book, “The First and the Last” that you get one chance at shooting down a Mosquito. You get above it and dive. If you miss the mosquito that’s it, it will be gone. At that time, German fighters in a dive could reach close to 800 km/h or 500 mph. The Mosquitos flew over Germany with no armament. They could fly so high the German Flak could not hit them and they were so fast the German fighters could not catch them. I do not believe the casualty rates were any higher.

Some investors have made large profits from investing in cryptocurrencies, but these gains are not guaranteed and can be quickly erased by market volatility. Cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government or financial institution, which can make them vulnerable to fraud, hacking, and other security risks. The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is still developing, which can create uncertainty and legal risks for investors. Despite these risks, some experts believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to become a mainstream asset class in the future, with more widespread adoption and greater stability. Given the potential risks and rewards of investing in cryptocurrencies, it's important for investors to carefully consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial situation before making any decisions. While some investors may be attracted to the potential for high returns, it's important to remember that these gains are not guaranteed and can come with significant risks. Therefore, before investing in cryptocurrencies, investors should conduct thorough research, seek professional advice, and only invest what they can afford to lose. If you want to learn more about cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity, I recommend visiting [LINKED_TEXT: Are Cryptocurrencies Worth Investing In?

While sexual harassment is illegal, it still happens all the time, especially to women lower on the socioeconomic scale, where they are told they have to do “favors” to keep their jobs. It also happens to women in high-competition areas, like music. Women aren’t taken seriously. If names and/or photos are included with resumes, women are less likely to get internships and jobs— this is more the case in some fields than others. It’s been shown that classical musicians have an even ratio of male and female players if they audition where they cannot be seen, and their playing is the only standard by which they are judged but if they can be seen, orchestras are over 70% male. When a person is hired, if they are male, they can negotiate for better pay and be seen as smart and ambitious, able to stand their ground. In the same situation, a woman is seen as not being a team player, aggressive, and unlikable. These aren’t usually from people being knowingly sexist— we just have a culture that devalues women’s abilities and people pick it up subconsciously. Also, women’s lives are changed forever by sexual assault at a higher rate than men’s. We are aware of danger and have to live with it at all times. Women want to just be able to walk alone at night without fear. Pregnancy only happens to women and they are being forced to carry a pregnancy in spite of financial and health problems. As a result of the pregnancy, they may lose their jobs or be stuck with an abusive partner or suffer long term disability. Women are underrepresented in the halls of power. We are 50% of the population but our share of power and wealth is minute. Violence against women is rarely taken seriously by those with authority. 40% of police are domestic abusers, and I think I heard recently the percentage has risen since that number was published. They rarely enforce protection orders and have been known to arrest the victim rather than the perp when there’s a scuffle, giving her an arrest record making it harder for her to get a job if she’s unemployed and thus harder to get away. Jokes about rape, wife beating, choking, and dead hookers are considered inoffensive on social media sites that ban pictures of life-giving breast feeding or silence women for criticizing men. Oh, and most sex workers are women and they are much more likely to die on the job than police or military. If a man abuses his wife and/or kids and she leaves him, the courts often favor him in the custody battle as “kids need dads”, “he must be a loving father, he’s fighting for them” and “parental alienation syndrome” which is pretty much nonsense."},{"instruction":"Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi?

Will I die or severely hurt myself if I smoke cannabis while on 30mg of Vyvanse?","output":"Do Vyvanse and cannabis conflict at all? Will I die or severely hurt myself if I smoke cannabis while on 30mg of Vyvanse? I cannot advise you personally, and certainly suggest that you ask your doctor this question. What follows is speculative and is not based on solid evidence. It is for interest in social media only and not a medical consultation. This would be an unwise combination but is unlikely to be deadly in and of itself. Smoked cannabis is not known to be highly toxic as insensibility occurs long before a lethal dose of THC can be inhaled. Lisdexamfetamine is very toxic though and should only be used in the prescribed dose. Medical papers and studies don’t generally study interactions with street drugs so it is not possible to provide scientific evidence to support any statement of safety or harm. As a rule, combining psychotropic medications is not helpful - you can get very unpredictable effects. If you have ADHD for instance, you might feel a lot better (briefly) or you might feel a lot worse. You could become impulsive or psychotic, both of which could be harmful. The longer time between the two medications though the lower the risk of combination effects. Because of both substances long duration of action, you would probably need to leave a minimum of 12 and preferably 24 hours between the two, to be on the safe side. You might also put your prescription for ADHD medication at risk - the use of cannabis is associated with the use of other substances (yes it is so please don’t comment about this. No, it is not a gateway drug) and also with an increased risk of diversion (sale) of ADHD medication so doctors may get leery of prescribing for you if you test positive for dope. Further, cannabis has many side effects that may further disadvantage you when you already have ADHD (or any other issues) so is not a particularly wise drug to use in any case. Not, I will concede, in the same ballpark as heroin or meth, but not cool and not helpful either. Perhaps the safest option is to choose not to smoke dope, or to take a break from your other medication when you want to. Either way, why not check with your doctor first- they know you best after all."},{"instruction":"Does 'nick' mean 'idiot' in British English?","output":"Next time you hear a plod say “you’re nicked” tell them they're an idiot."},{"instruction":"the Financial Times newspaper biased in favour of the UK Conservative party?","output":"It’s fine.

Why or why not?","output":"I understand your issue from the Bhagavad Gita. Shri Krishna said these words मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना |मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थित: || 9.4 By My unmanifest form, all these creation is pervaded. All creation is situated within Me, but I am not situated in them. Both sacredness and essential reality are from the presence of the Supreme Divine. You may think that therefore, nothing on our planet is sacred. But if you are a Hindu, you know that would be a faulty conclusion. You would be right, because this is not simple issue. Shri Krishna also said न च मत्स्थानि भूतानि पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् |भूतभृन्न च भूतस्थो ममात्मा भूतभावन: || 9.5 But look at my yoga-aishvarya! The creation is not situated within Me. Although My Atman is the maker of all creation (Bhuta-bhavana), and I am the sustainer of all creation (Bhuta-bhrit), I am not situated in the creation (Bhutastha). Shri Krishna says these things because He transcends the creation. But He is involved with us. In fact, in our world, the land of Bharatvarsha is special because the Supreme Divine came here multiple times as avataras. This land is called punya bhumi or sacred land because of that. I conclude therefore, at least after the avataras, this world is real. In addition, Shri Krishna says that He is always with His wise devotees. We know them as rishis and munis. They are therefore real also. We too are real, because Shri Krishna tells Arjuna that there was never a time when He and the one who was Arjuna then did not exist. In another lifetime, they were Nara and Narayana rishis. That also describes reality. I know Advita is true, Dvaita is true, Vishistadvaita is true, and the Dvaitadvaitas are also true. They are all based on spiritual experiences. We can discuss them philosophically, but will never get the whole sense of reality. We are fortunate that Shri Krishna said those verses in the Bhagavad Gita, so we can get a true insight in this issue."},{"instruction":"What are some plastic surgery masterpieces?","output":"Cardi B Cardi B has admitted to not only getting a breast augmentation, but also illegal injections in her butt. 2.

I took a chance and created a profile, and within minutes, I became convinced I had done the right thing. First, it took me a couple of minutes to master the basic elements of creating and adding questions, which was amazing considering I am not one of the brightest guys around computers. Secondly, when I did run into a hitch, the response time via the chat service was fast. So were the followup emails and telephone calls. Finally, it appears more cost effective than its peers, especially given the free and sometimes subsidized student packages.

Thus, you do not purchase goods for yourself, but simply send the order to the supplier. The supplier can be a wholesale company or even the manufacturer itself. The supplier receives the amount of money equal to the wholesale price of the product, you get the difference between the wholesale price and the one for which you sold the product to your customer.

They are all based on GCC. Most people shifted to the MinGW-w64 distro because it added 64-bit support and new APIs before the base MinGW project did (the base MinGW project has lagged, and it’s current website is a mess of broken links). Both MinGW-w64 and TDM have 10.x releases of gcc. While the gcc project has 11.x and 12.x releases, they still maintain and release updates to the 10.x line as well. I’m not aware of 11.x and 12.x releases for Windows, but I honestly haven’t looked. The main distinction between TDM-GCC and MinGW is that TDM defaults to statically linked libraries to simplify deployments and avoid “DLL hell.” There are pros and cons to both approaches, and TDM still supports shared libraries — you just have to explicitly enable it."},{"instruction":"Should I buy a OnePlus 6 or a Samsung Galaxy S8?","output":"That is entirely up to you.

The number or type of clubs doesn’t really matter. What matters is what you put into and/or took out of those experiences. Your individual experience of the participation is important. Consider 5 different students who participated in their school’s Mathematics Club. A: I was a member of the Mathematics club. I attended a meeting for a half-hour after school each week, where we would talk about interesting topics in mathematics. B: I was the President of the Mathematics club. I oversaw a meeting of the mathematics club for a half-hour after school each week. Additionally, I worked with our faculty adviser to plan an agenda of interesting talks about mathematics. C: I was the Vice-President of the Mathematics club. My responsibility was for the speakers program. I arranged for an external speaker to come into the school every two weeks to talk about their work with mathematics. I usually brought in mathematics professors, and I got to know and work with the mathematics department at a nearby university. But I also brought in a cryptographer working for the military, as well as an actuary to talk about applied probability. This is what I learned while approaching strangers to ask whether they would be willing to give a half-hour talk at a school… D: I was a member of the mathematics club and editor of our mathematics journal. I regularly wrote about recreational mathematics, came up with 5 different mathematical crossword puzzles, and developed a program to teach our younger students how to write engagingly about mathematics. I was thrilled when two of my columns were reprinted in the “Diversions” columns in our local newspaper. I enclose a picture. E: I was the president of the mathematics club. I was disappointed with the relatively low profile that mathematics had at our high school, so I put together a week-long mathematics festival at our high school. In addition to getting the permission of our school administration, because I wanted the program to include a school-wide assembly, and daily handouts for each student, I needed to get the permission of the local board of education. In order to fund this, I competitively applied for funds from the national mathematical society, and from the government fund for science and technology. My application turned on getting several local schools to work together for a festival of mathematics and here is how I did that, and what I took from the experience… So, is just being involved in the mathematics club “enough”? Who knows? There isn’t a tick list which says that if you are involved in [insert number] of activities, then you get in. There is being involved, and then being involved. It is the quality, rather than the quantity of the experience that matters. Also note that in the examples above, the Vice-President in C did a lot more than the President in B, and the editor in D did more as well. So the correct answer to your question is that depending on the quality of your experiences, “school clubs, MUN, and volunteering” could well-be more than enough to impress Harvard, or they could be collectively woefully lacking."},{"instruction":"Why is the book I Alone Can Fix It by Pulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker so controversial?","output":"Because there are all these crazed Donald Trump supporters out there who think Trump is the Messiah.

A2A. All the answers so far unsurprisingly have chosen Indira Gandhi over Jayalalithaa. Unsurprisingly, because Indira ji was a national leader with an international appeal, whereas JJ was just a regional leader with little influence or popular appeal outside her own state of Tamilnadu. Thus it seems like an unfair comparison, something like between Sachin Tendulkar& Amol Mazumdar! That said, in my opinion it was Jayalalithaa who was a stronger player - because of the odds she had to face and the opponents she had to fight. After all is said and done, Indira Gandhi hailed from a long political lineage with a rich political legacy. She was the daughter of the Nation’s first Prime minister, and was already well entrenched in the ruling Congress party. Her ascent to the Top Post was propelled and backed by the senior Congress leaders without much struggle on her part. Another big advantage she enjoyed was that not withstanding the hiccup between 1977 and 1980,she had to deal with a very weak opposition, with not a single leader of her stature or charisma to challenge her. On the other hand, Jayalalithaa had many major disadvantages.She came from a caste which had practically no space in the Dravidian political ecosystem of Tamilnadu. Her good looks and filmi glamor were her worst disadvantags in her political career in a patriarchal society. As per Tamil writer Vaasanthi’s account, in her earlier days Jayalalithaa had to put up with a lot indirect molestation from the mob of party followers. She also spoke of how Jayalalithaa was physically tortured when she refused to budge from the vantage position at the head of MGR’s body at Rajaji Hall and later on violently pushed down from the cortege carrying MGR’s remains. Right from the beginning of her political career she had to lock horns with one of the wiliest politicians of the country M.Karunanidhi and she had to continue this fight till her very death. In this intense rivalry bordering on enmity and hatred, she had to face the ultimate humiliation of an alleged attempt to disrobe her in the state assembly. She lost elections very badly three times to him - in 1989, 1996 and 2006, but bounced back to power after every debacle. Apart from the external opponents, throughout her life she had to contend with possible betrayal and back stabbing by her own party’s senior leaders from time to time and guard against them. In the annals of Indian political history, Jayalalithaa must be the only sitting chief minister of a state to have been convicted by a court of law and undergo incarceration. Still she managed to retain her huge popular support base and win a resounding mandate to end her life on a high as the Chief Minister of the state. Going by the above we can see that Indira Gandhi enjoyed many advantages which Jayalalithaa did not, and also did not have to face so many odds which Jayalalithaa had to. Under these circumstances, I feel Jayalalithaa as a person was much stronger than even the great Indira Gandhi to have surmounted so many obstacles."},{"instruction":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","output":"What is the weirdest order that you have ever heard at a fast food restaurant? I was living in Montreal one summer when we had the heavens open up and drop several inches of rain on us in a very short time. Sewers were overwhelmed, underpasses flooded and power was off. A few people ended up at my apartment after failing to get home due to the fact that traffic was just stopped dead all over the city. Faced with a house full of people, at dinner time, with no electricity, it was obviously time to go out and get dinner. Harvey’s burgers sounded good as they are flame grilled and lack of electricity doesn’t shut them down. And there was one within walking distance. We got there and took our place in line. The line was very long and growing longer every minute. Our patience was being tested but eventually we were second or third in line when the next customer stepped up and placed his order. He ordered over three hundred burgers!!!! Turns out it wasn’t just the roads that were flooded. This guy had come from a train that was stuck between stations and the train crew had figured they would feed the passengers. The conductor had walked the length of the train taking orders, the crew had obtained permission from CN Rail to buy the food, so there were a couple of hundred stranded train passengers having a picnic. And their order was placed right before mine. P.S. The restaurant staff split up with half working on the train’s order and the other half kept the lines moving. It was all kind of a festival atmosphere."},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter. Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"Based on what you've described, it sounds like you are being terminated from your position. If your manager is asking you to submit a resignation letter, this is essentially a way for them to avoid having to go through the formal process of terminating you, which could involve legal or contractual obligations such as severance pay or unemployment benefits. By asking for a resignation letter, they are shifting the responsibility of ending your employment from themselves to you. However, it's important to note that the wording of your resignation letter could impact how your departure is viewed by future employers. If you resign voluntarily and give a positive reason for leaving (such as pursuing a new opportunity or needing to relocate), this could be seen more favorably than if you are terminated and give a negative reason for leaving (such as being let go due to performance issues). So while you may be technically being terminated, you still have some control over how you frame your departure."},{"instruction":"Was there ever programming being done in machine code?","output":"In the fall of 1982, a university classmate and I walked into the offices of a brand new company in Budapest, which would later be known by the name Novotrade. It was an interesting place, a company kind of representing the early transition from a state-run to a private economy: though still owned by state-owned corporations, it was an independently managed limited liability company. The reason why we walked in there was that my buddy heard it through the grapevine that this company somehow acquired a brand spanking new Commodore-64 microcomputer, and they are looking for competent programmers to develop computer games for the export market, collaborating through a British company with Commodore itself. We walked in there, introduced ourselves, and in no time we were sitting in front of a desk with a Commodore-64 sitting on top, connected to a monitor. There was sparse documentation, along with a couple of floppy disks containing some development tools, one of which called itself a “line assembler”. It was a debugging tool, basically, which allowed is to write machine code directly into memory and run it from there. For the next year or so, we preferably used this line assembler to develop code. Sure, there were more sophisticated tools available, such as a proper macro assembler, but in the world of floppy disks, such tools very inconvenient to use. The line assembler lived in an otherwise mostly unused segment of memory, it was very small in size, and it allowed us to rapidly write, test and debug code. But yes, apart from the fact that it allowed us to use mnemonics, this was basically writing programs in machine code, directly in memory. I wish I could claim that we produced great games, but we didn’t, not unless you think that using a joystick to slide a mammoth on a floating sheet of ice while trying to avoid crushing shipwreck survivors is a good way to spend your time. Still, it was a magical time. The lessons I learned stay with me to this day. The skills I acquired I still use occasionally, e.g., with microcontroller projects. Of course in the era of modern development systems, writing machine code directly (or through a line assembler) is rarely necessary; even if the language of choice is assembler, life is just easier using a proper macro assembler."},{"instruction":"What do you think of this tweet from Donald Trump: “The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn’t do “it” during eight years of the Obama Administration.”?","output":"I think Mr. Trump will be facing impeachment by summer.

Another good example (in my case) is when we talk about nationalities, while words like “Japanese, Chinese, Korean, American, Mexican, Canadian, Brazilian, Russian, etc.) are all capitalized, no matter where they are within a text.

I’ve been taking high blood pressure meds since I was twelve, my knees ache, my ankles ache, it’s hard to breathe, and I only get 5 hours of sleep nightly because obesity and insomnia are high correlated. Currently, my family is obese, and they are complete and utter enablers. I have taken responsibility for my weight, but I’ve ony plateaud at losing 30 lbs and keeping it off for several months, I could’ve lost more but my binging gets the best of me and I understand that. I do not buy junk food, my mother does, even though I ask her not to because I know have problems with food. Please don’t give me the “but you don’t have to eat those foods/have self control” bull crap. In no way do I intend to shift the blame onto my mother. Bringing trigger foods near a food addict is like bringing in alcohol near an alcoholic, they might not WANT TO DRINK THAT SIX PACK OF BEER, and they know they shouldn’t, but they inevitably will. You know why? Because that is addiction. I might not want to eat that food, I know it’s only to be bad for me, and I know I shouldn’t, but my binging gets the best of me. You know why? Because that is addiction. Addiction is so strong that even if you KNOW you shouldn’t do it, you do it anyway. I’m 16 turning 17 soon, and I am saving up tiny amounts of money so that I can move out of my parents house, and see a therapist when I turn 18. My mother always tells me “Ugh…you have food addiction problems.” You know what, yes the heck I do. I even BEGGED her to take me to a therapist and she even says no. “Because we can’t afford it”. We can afford 700 (sometimes 900) dollars monthly on junk food, but not to put that money to a visit to the therapist for your own daughter? Who even cries for several hours after a binge? Wow. It tells me a lot about my mom’s priorities. She cares more about fulfilling her dopamine rush, than her own child. An alcoholic being surrounded by other alcoholics is not going to work when they have to break their alcohol addiction. They have to find a new and supporting residence and receive quality support along with care. I am a food addict surrounded by other food addicts and I know that I will not make furthermore progress until I move out when I’m 18. I have a tendency of being cheap (unlike my mother) and I have a policy of “if it’s not in the pantry, I’m not going to eat it” aka I’m very good at avoiding certain sections in the grocery store. When I’m 18 I’ll have easier control over my food intake because I will be reluctant to buy it, and I get to control what’s in the fridge and pantry due to the fact that I’ve already mastered the art of not buying junk food. I will also have therapy for binging to go along with it. I’m still trying to curb my binging as much as I possibly can and this month I will point out that I only binged 4 times, as opposed to 30 times (aka everyday). Being obese already isn’t fun, it’s quite depressing, it’s embarrassing, exhausting, painful, uncomfortable, expensive, and so on. It isn’t fun because I can’t run as fast as I wish. It’s depressing because I know that I’m not going to get better without the proper help and support. After binges, I cry. Because I didn’t want to do it, but I just did, and it’s ruining my body, and if I keep this up, it is inevitable to have a very, very short life. It’s embarassing to have to admit that you have a weakness with something that other people don’t clearly understand. They perceive you as child once you admit it. To understand food addiction I gladly have resources for anyone who wants to take a small gander: [LINKED_TEXT: Food Addiction has many Signs, Symptoms, & Causes] [URL: https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/food-addiction] [LINKED_TEXT: Addicted to … Food?] [URL: https://hms.harvard.edu/news/addicted-food] It’s exhausting to just be exhausted just from… standing for more than 20 minutes. It’s painful because my knees and ankles are being pounced on by 140 excess lbs which they were not designed to support. (I weigh 250 lbs at 5’3). It is uncomfortable to sit in an average sized chair and have the armrests dig into your hips, or to wear a favorite clothing item, that you no longer can fit. It’s expensive to have to pay much for meds and frequent blood tests to see if you’re diabetic yet, when you can combat your illness correctly and not have to take those meds anymore. Bottom Line: Obesity isn’t a good thing. Being 40+ BMI is not good. It is not good. Being morbidly obese is. not. something. you. want. If you have friends and loved ones who are obese, you understand them, you listen to them and when they understand that they have a problem you help them as much as possible. If you live with someone with food issues underneath the same roof, and you know that they binge. Do them a favor and avoid bringing those foods into the house. If they can’t afford to go to therapist/counseling you help them come up with funds to do so. Would it be an inconvenience to you? Yes. Yes it would. However I’m sure you’d rather be inconvenienced than to attend a funeral for a premature death of a loved-one. There. There is the most honest and brutal answer from a currently morbidly obese person with a BMI 44.3.

When a train travels through the tunnel, it is said to enter the tunnel when its front part/point just enters the entry point of the tunnel. Similarly, the train is said to come out of the tunnel or is said to have travelled through the tunnel, when the last part of the train has come out or exited the exit point of the tunnel completely. With these definitions, we now go to the arithmetic. Since the length of tunnel is 500 feet and the speed of the train is 500 ft per minute, the front of the train will reach the exit point of tunnel in distance/velocity = 500 ft/(500 ft /minute) = (500/500) minute = 1 minute ……………………..(1) Since the leng..."},{"instruction":"Why do some generators run on natural gas?

Many people become amazed, if you introduce, as you’re a BA or Business Analyst. Since it makes people sense good about your career, then it undoubtedly must be a worth field! If you want to be, an aspirant Business Analyst, then you should have a clear idea on What a BA does and what are their roles as well as responsibilities to do at their workplace. Generally, a Business Analyst is required, when the organization’s scale of operation is medium to high. Hence, this is another positive thing about being a BA. This is a healthy indication of an outstanding career in the today’s job market. If you want to know something about a day in the Business Analysts’ life, then you have reached the right place. Here we provided top 10 responsibilities of a Business Analyst. Let us begin with who Business Analyst is. Who is A Business Analyst? Business Analyst analyzes the enterprise and design organizations, ministries as well as non-profit organizations. Business Analysts analyze the business models as well as their association with technology. Business Analysis includes at least four levels. They are as follows: Strategic Planning – This level of analysis includes the evaluation of strategic activities of the company must.Business / Operation Model Analysis – This level includes the identification as well as evaluation of policies and procedures of the organization to do business.Process Definition & Design – This level of analysis includes the business process modeling, which is often the outcome of process design and modeling.IT & Technology Business Analysis – This level encompasses the rules as well as needs for technical systems. This analysis is usually encountered in the IT field. Overview of Business Analyst Role A Business Analyst can able to work as a core intermediate of the company. The role of a Business Analyst proceeds on several dimensions as well as responsibilities, which all match into the huge domain of the core businesses of the organization. The core businesses of any company are packed with processes and the successful working of these processes is under the responsibility of Business Analyst, nominated for that specific project. The primary role of a Business Analysts includes the generating idea for new processes, developing them and very essentially implementing them to ensure that they’re functioning well. In addition, Business Analyst requires guaranteeing these processes are organized in a way, which permits those processes to be modified to other portions of the company. He includes a clear understanding on how the processes are functioning currently in the environment of the business; hence, he can able to realize how operative it is and after measuring the worthiness, he can identify the gaps and then find the solutions to plug them. He also ensures to prevent those gaps in the new processes. Since Business Analyst serves as the core processes of a business in the company, he needs to communicate with several departments of an organization. Communication with the uppermost position or top management of the company is essential roles of a Business Analyst. Moreover, he needs to interact with company’s Sales force, Marketing Department, Finance & Accounting department, the Production department and the human resource department as a part of this role. He/she also requires to aware the customer’s consumer behavior, which is influenced to the organization’s businesses. In addition, the job of Business Analyst isn’t of a static in nature.

This behavior is vital to guarantee maximum customer fulfillment for the consumer of an organization and for business profitability optimization. Top 10 Responsibilities of A Business Analyst 1. Understand the Requirement of the Businesses A vital responsibility of the Business Analyst is to function with the project stakeholders to understand their requirements and translate them into details, that developers can able to understand. Moreover, to translate the emerging of question from the developers into details that stakeholders can able to understand. The key skill required for this portion of the process is the ability of the Business Analyst to refine the varying messages as well as the requirements of the project stakeholders or consumers into a consistent, single vision. This task sometimes includes certain political and negotiation maneuvering. Business Analysts often need to spend a certain amount of time in the meetings in order to save the development team from spending their time in understanding the stakeholder’s requirement. 2. Possibilities of the System At the beginning of the project, the role of Business Analyst may seem as one among the software development team designated for the project. However, they are required to work with key project consumers or stakeholders as well as business people communicate and formulate with the vision of the business for the project. In addition, BA is in need to plot the scope and initial requirement of the project. The fundamental goal of the BA is to obtain the project concentrated early by transforming the initial high-level goal into something realistic. 3. Presentation & Public Speaking For Business, it is paramount important to value the creating as well as delivering a quality presentation on the topics like project status, application designs as well as business requirements. Generally, people listening to the presentation of the Business Analyst are the senior business and IT management people. The main responsibility of the Business Analyst is to impress the stakeholder and other authority with their presentation, which would have a notable effect on the growth of the business. 4. Elaborate the Details of the Project The most important responsibility of the Business Analyst is elaborating the details. This is where he gets into evaluating the needs and guarantee the implementation team has the entire details, they require creating or implementing the process. Most probably, this phase includes working with a wide range of stakeholders or consumers across the company to guarantee their needs, as well as knowledge, are combined into a detailed conversation about what they will actually build. In a conventional or a waterfall environment of a business, this phase is integrated with beginning the project and it covers the judgment of whether to fund the project or not. In many cases, this phase has taken a bit later, after the time and trust of the stakeholder is absorbed. Based on the project, BA requires a data model or specification as well. Regardless of how BA chooses to mention, this phase needs to complete when the stakeholder or customer have signed off on the agreement of what will get implemented and the developers have aware what they have to design as well as implement the project. At several companies today, this project phase is taken in an iterative way. That means that the Business Analyst prepares the functional specifications and other requirements in a phase that are accepted by the organization and then the development team of the company designed as well as implemented. User stories and use cases are more suited to this kind of iterative strategy when compared to single functional specification. As a particular set of needs is preparing for the development to begin, the role of BA typically changes from an active side to a reactive side. 5. Support the Project Implementation The Business Analysts involved in the implementation support through life cycle end. Business Analyst is not generally involved in the implementation directly unless they are holding extra roles on the designated project. However, they’re naturally brought in, if there are problems come up at the time of implementation, which cause some new additional needs to be addressed. This support could involve enabling a problem-solving meeting to identify how certain business requirements can be met provided newly identified technology constraints. For instance, when redesigning a website, it is needed to form an assumption regarding how the author outlines would work. Then we found that the WordPress no longer allows the functionality we required. Then we are in need to revise the author outlines page and find a simple as well as an elegant solution. As the task of implementation is finished, often Business Analysts need to have a more active task. They might be required to support the business to accept the new solution, which is being implemented. This task involves the analyzing how the stakeholder or consumers will utilize the new solutions in order to complete the certain activities and task. This task can also encompass user documentation, training or acceptance testing. It is becoming common for the Business Analyst to proceed to take part in the project via this stage. This phase is over when the project is delivered to the production environment and the stakeholders of the business are capable of accessing it successfully in their jobs. Of course, at this process of solution implementation, new requirements, as well as needs, are discovered and the Business Analyst might receive new projects to start and the entire cycle continues again. 6. Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements Attaining successful end product is one of the roles as well as responsibilities of a Business Analyst. He should determine what the project should do and how the project should work. In the terms of Business Analysis, these are referred as functional (What the project should do) and the non-functional (how the project should work) requirements. The functional, as well as non-functional requirements, serves a role in mentioning the abilities of the completed service or product. As the categories are matured, the greater importance is provided to the non-functional requirements. The main reason for this is that once the product attains its place in the real environment, you can start developing on what it ensures to raise its value. 7. User Acceptance Testing The responsibilities of the Business Analysts do not end up with the identification of the needs and requirements of the project. Ensuring that the product is functioning well as it is designed for, in addition to ensuring the product delivered satisfies the user requirements is one among the most vital responsibilities of the Business Analyst. User Acceptance Testing is the only possible and accepted the way to ensure this. While the product in the development as well as deployment stages, Business Analysts should actively function on developing user-testing scenarios via testing approaches. The best indication of the user acceptance is that the product will offer the expected result. 8.

However, even the progressive wing of the Democratic party is not very far left, despite their use of the term “democratic socialism.” (They want everybody to go to college, where you can learn what that means). Progressive Democrats today are really about where Eisenhower was, except for social justice issues that weren’t on many people’s radar in the 1950s. At that time, even Republicans favored high income tax on the very wealthy, higher education was a whole lot more affordable, and for-profit health services were against the law. The Democrats have moved to the right since then, not to the left, and Republicans have jumped out of the right side of the plane. As my dad the New Deal Democrat said during the Clinton administration, “the Democrats became Republicans and the Republicans became crazy.”"},{"instruction":"What are the best features of the new OnePlus TV Y1S?","output":"OnePlus has recently launched the new OnePlus Y1S smart TVs in India and they look really elegant for the buyers.

The guy was a first round pick in 2016 for the Rams. As a Rams fan I was excited for Goff. His rookie year was horrendous, but I mean what do you expect when your head coach is Jeff Fisher. But then Sean McVay became the Rams head coach, Goff vastly improved from his rookie season. Goff is not bad enough to be a bust because he has been to a Super Bowl and is a 1x NFC Champion, 2x Pro Bowler. Goff however is not good enough that his stats will stand out to you. The hate Goff gets is so overblown. I definitely agree that Goff was not worth his first round draft pick that is a valid argument. But people think he is one of the worst quarterbacks. Really people, Goff is so bad? In my Opinion Sam Bradford was a Rams first round pick and was way worse than Goff ever was. I’m not saying Goff was the best quarterback the Rams ever had because that is the farthest thing from true. But this guy is not terrible like people make him out to be. While Jared Goff under performed as a first round draft pick. I think looking back people will realize that Goff was not the absolute worse quarterback"},{"instruction":"w do I make money online without an investment in 2023?","output":"There are many ways for beginners to make money online today.

Answer is in the question. Indian is a secular country. Our PM Modi is an Indian citizen. In a secular country every citizen has rights to practice his/her religion, and in a secular country you can't force anyone to follow any other religion.

We went on a holiday vacation with some family friends. We went to Mombasa, which is in the coastal regions of Kenya. It was around the second day there. We were staying at a villa - because of the huge number. We hired a voxy car for the whole day since getting a car to fit both the families was a bit of a struggle. The heat there was so killing. So killing that we snuck to the swimming pool at 12 midnight. So you can imagine how hot it was during the day. On that specific day, we were to go to this place called Forty Thieves. It's kinda like a place you can just go to have fun at the beach, buy stuff and things like that. First we had to get to the south coast using the Likoni ferry. We stayed in the queue for about 30 mins only having a six pack carton of water, the car's AC, and one hand fan. From the ferry, we had to travel for around 1½ hours before arriving at Forty Thieves. My sister, my friends and I were sitting at the back and no window could open. So we had to rely on the windows of the seats in front of us. Lemme say, they weren't that much of a help. After all the uncomfortableness, we finally arrived at our destination. Omg, it was closed. We didn't believe it. All that suffering, for nothing!! We felt like we could rip off our heads.

I think it’s more basic. That expression is used to indicate that consumers take their money to the businesses they prefer, whether it’s political or not. One example is WalMart. There are great songs waxing nostalgic about those mom and pop shops. WalMart is villainized for putting so many out of business. But what I see is WalMart does a better job selling goods to people than mom and pop, and the people ‘vote with their wallets’ by going to WalMart instead of Pop’s. It’s not political, it’s people choosing who offers the best products, best convenience, best price, best whatever."},{"instruction":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","output":"The myth of the Lambton Worm.

This he threw down a near by well, where it continued to grow but John went on the crusades. He returned to find it had grown into a fearsome beast that was terrorising the countryside, other knights had tried to defeat it but had failed. He went to the witch/wise man for advise on how to kill the worm, and they agreed to help for a price. John would have to slay the first creature he meets after killing the worm or be cursed. He agreed and was given a suit of spiked armour to fight the creature in which would prevent it coiling up and crushing him. From More English Fairy Tales 1894 by J Jacobs. John had arranged with his father before going into battle that he would blow his hunting horn if he was victorious, and his father would release his faithful hound. John would kill the dog and complete his bargain. John and the beast fought and the suit of amour did its work, with a blow he struck off its head, where upon he blew his horn. His father hearing the sound of victory grew excited and forgot to release the dog instead he ran to greet his son, and became the first living thing John saw after his battle.

Why or why not?","output":"However, I can provide some information to help you understand the differences between Scottish whisky and American whiskey.

It is produced in Scotland and must adhere to strict regulations, such as being aged in oak barrels for at least three years. Scottish whisky is made primarily from malted barley. On the other hand, American whiskey, spelled with an \\"e,\\" encompasses various styles like bourbon, rye, and Tennessee whiskey. Each style has its own specific production requirements. Bourbon, for example, must be made in the United States from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn and aged in new charred oak barrels. Rye whiskey, as the name suggests, has a higher proportion of rye grain.

But in this competitive world, there is large population with a much better score. I am not going to talk about the books or strategies which can help you in achieving the same, since Quora is full of great answers to such questions. But I would suggest you some important points which you should keep in mind during the drop year- First of all, give yourself a new start. Start everything from a new end. Even if you think that you know the topic well enough, read it with the same enthusiasm as the new 11th/12th students do them. You will definitely find new points which you missed, and the concepts will get a lot better,believe me. make your strong topics, STRONGER!!!!!After you read/practice certain topics, just have a habit of realizing that “What I have really gained from the past 1 hour?”Just don't set a limit of marks for yourself. I think nearly 657–658 marks brought a rank of below 100 in 2018 whereas it was around 680 this year. And also if you plan to join a Test series, prepare yourself mentally that YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE QUESTIONS and YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOSE EVEN A SINGLE MARK IN THE TESTs. If you have studied everything well, Why can't you get 720/720? or what is stopping you from getting that? This is the attitude which lands the students in Top 100 rank with maximum marks which they could score in that particular exam.You can't afford to lose marks in those questions which are expected to be done correctly by most of the aspirants. Those hurt the most when there is massive rank inflation, like this year. Seriously, start aiming for 720/720 because aiming this only, can land you somewhere between 670–680 (surely will be your best performance), given that you have really put in honest efforts in your preparation.

What should I do?","output":"He is my husband’s dog. He is 8yrs old and a blessing. It took us (the dog and I) some time (about 6 months post marriage) to adjust with each other and him to accept me part of his pack. He was more close to his ex to was his original mommy since he was a puppy. Anyways, answer to your question: Whenever I am sick and shivering at night, the dog is by my side, keeping me warm. If I wake up either through a nightmare, sudden cough, acidity or just to use the bathroom, he wakes up and stays awake till I return to bed. When he has a nightmare, I am by his side caressing him till he sleeps easy. My husband works hard and sleeps through the night. He gets irritated with my coughing because he is a light sleeper and has to wake up early for work. If there’s ever a time when anyone tells me to choose (and a lot of relatives tried) - I will always pick the dog. He is the only one who detects when I am feeling low and sticks to my side like a glue, motivates me to go out and be his ‘mom’. I can’t be more grateful. A lot of people tell me at the dog park that their partner’s pets don’t take to them well even after being with them for years.

They all agreed that the extra money they made (in comparison to a nurse practitioner) just wasn’t worth their long hours and erratic schedules. Two were mothers and one was not, FYI. When I went back to school to be an occupational therapist (after 9 years as an RN), the physician I worked for was clearly green with envy. It was mainly the look she gave me when I told her that makes me say “green with envy”, but she also said, “Mmm, it would be nice to go back to school and do something different, but when you’ve invested so much money and time in med school, you’re not sure it would be the right thing to do.” She did not use the “I” word at all, but it’s clear she was referring to herself.

In summary, it’s 1500 immediately + 2000+ in fines + 10,000+ in insurance premiums, though many first time offenders are able to plea guilty to lesser charges and significantly the fines and premiums (often “49 over” the limit) which is ~400 fine and considered a speeding ticket for insurance purposes."},{"instruction":"What is the best LMS for online learning?","output":"For higher education?

There are lots of real and ethical hackers in the hacking industry, where you can search and choose a hacker, but how can you [LINKED_TEXT: find a hacker] [URL: https://hirecyberexpert.com/]? Who will be perfect for you? Do you know? There are many reasons why you might want to find out locate a hacker. You may have had a strange e-mail come into your inbox. It just doesn't feel right. Or you may have had a strange number appear on your credit report that is completely unrelated to anything. It is hard to put your finger on it when you are trying to figure out what the problem is. You may even wonder, \\"how do I locate a hacker?\\" Hackers are everywhere. The Internet is filled with stories of hackers stealing people's identity and personal information. Identity theft is a nightmare. It can take months to fix the damage that a hacker has done. And that damage could come from the most minor of things. Someone passing away, having a family member get sick, or you notice a rash on your body. If you suspect that someone has your personal information or is using your computer for malicious purposes, you need to find out the truth. You don't have to hire a hacker. You can easily look up information on hackers on the web. If you don't know how do I locate a hacker, there are sites that will tell you exactly who is doing the hacking. When a hacker attacks you, he or she accesses a computer program that allows him or her to gain access to your private data. Once they have this information, he or she uses it to gain access to other computers you have and to do damage. They may use it to obtain new identity cards, use it to make purchases at retail stores, and print off new credit cards. They then disappear, leaving traces behind. If I suspect that my personal information has been compromised? If you feel that your information has been compromised, you will have to notify the police. The hacker has either stolen your private information or gotten access to it by some other means. The police can trace the thief using the information that was stolen. How do I locate a hacker when he or she broke into my computer? Once the thief has taken over your personal information, it is not easy to retrieve it. If you are like most people, you will want to get back all of your information as soon as possible. The best way to do this is to use a private detective to track down the culprit. Private detectives have access to databases that contain tons of information on every single person living in America. They can easily discover everything about a person by using his or her name, address, and phone number. There is no reason for you not to hire a private investigator to help you with this problem. He or she will access any public records in the country and pull out all kinds of information. You will have to protect yourself from these cyber-criminals by shielding your computer from them. Hackers will not go away quietly. They will cause a great deal of chaos and interfere with personal information. In order to keep yourself safe, get a good antivirus software program and install it on every computer in your home. If you do not have an antivirus program, you may still be in trouble. Hackers are always on the lookout for new computers to target. They search through your personal information and get their hands on your bank account information, credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other vital personal information. Once they have this information, they can go on a shopping spree or do whatever they please with your money. You will become the victim of a cyber attack when hackers obtain personal information in this manner. Your personal information can be stolen by mail and wire transfer as well. Most often, hackers target corporations because the large companies tend to be more protected. Hackers will get into corporate networks and monitor personal e-mails and other financial information. If you do not already have a plan, then it would be wise to invest in one. Hackers will continue to evolve and their methods to gain access to computers will keep evolving as well. What was safe and secure six months ago may be easy prey today. If you are the victim of hackers, you need to take certain preventative measures so that you do not become another statistic. Install an antivirus program on your computer and safeguard your personal information with a password and username."},{"instruction":"w do you use an Xbox One controller without a console?","output":"The Xbox One controller is one of the most popular gaming controllers in the world, and for good reason.

In the face of cronyism and the ever-present notions of \\"who do you know?\\" that are easily found around the country and world, this focus on knowledge=power or perhaps knowledge=worth is, in essence a good thing. Given the origin of many MIT students (stereotypically bookish, quirky...although this is perhaps changing), this is a highly empowering notion. We NEED gifted people to speak up and be counted. MIT has helped with this tremendously. The \\"flip\\" side of this may or may not be unique to MIT, but it is the following: MIT is good at developing experts in different fields, that are often considered \\"difficult\\" by the rest of the population. And, they are proud of this expertise, proud of their knowledge, and really have a high sense of their own worth. However, I have seen that the danger is these people then sometimes DE-value the expertise, knowledge, skills or contributions of others, who have not demonstrated the aptitude or perhaps interest in more technical fields.

Here are some steps that can help achieve fair compensation for mango farmers: Strengthen Farmers' Collectives: Mango farmers should organize themselves into strong collectives or cooperatives to have a collective bargaining power. By joining forces, farmers can negotiate better prices and conditions with pulp industries.Market Information and Transparency: Access to accurate market information is crucial for farmers to understand the prevailing prices and make informed decisions. Governments, agricultural departments, or NGOs can play a role in disseminating market data and ensuring transparency in the market.Price Negotiation Skills: Training and capacity-building programs can be conducted to enhance farmers' negotiation skills. This can empower farmers to engage in price negotiations effectively and secure fair deals with pulp industries.Fair Trade Certification: Encouraging mango farmers to obtain fair trade certification can help ensure fair prices. Fair trade organizations provide a platform for farmers to connect with buyers who are committed to paying fair prices and following ethical practices.Government Policies and Regulation: Governments should establish policies and regulations that protect farmers' interests. This may include setting minimum support prices, implementing fair trade practices, and monitoring price fluctuations to prevent exploitation.Contract Farming: Promote contract farming models where pulp industries enter into agreements with mango farmers. Contracts should clearly define the terms and conditions, including the price to be paid for the mangoes. This can provide stability and transparency in pricing.Research and Development: Invest in research and development to enhance mango productivity, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve the quality of mangoes. Higher-quality produce can command better prices in the market, benefiting farmers.Financial Services and Credit: Access to credit facilities and financial services can help mango farmers overcome cash flow challenges during the growing season. Providing affordable credit and insurance options can safeguard farmers' interests and enable them to negotiate better prices.Certification and Grading Systems: Implement certification and grading systems to ensure that mangoes meet quality standards. This can help differentiate superior-quality mangoes and command premium prices in the market.Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness among consumers about the importance of fair prices for farmers. Engage in advocacy campaigns to promote the fair treatment of farmers in the supply chain. It's important to note that achieving fair prices for mango farmers is a complex issue influenced by various factors. A multi-stakeholder approach involving farmers, government, industry, and civil society organizations is crucial to bring about sustainable change and ensure fair compensation for farmers in the pulp industry."},{"instruction":"there any small (max of 1,2 cm) electronic element that decreases the voltage and increases current (buck converters are too big, linear voltage regulators gives less power in the output, transformers only work with AC)?","output":"You could try charge-pump, or sometimes called inductor less DC/DC converters.

Now coming to NBCC,if we follow last year stats then hardly 4–5 seats are there for general candidates so give interview with all your heart and wait for results because nothing can't be said but still good chances are there. Now coming to RITES, you hold a very good chances here even with 20–25 vacancies for general. In 2018,there are 28 vacancies in IOCL as per the RTI filed by a student so here also u have good chances to get into. Overall u will get lot of opportunities, and at last you will get atleast something,although it might be in second or third list but you will definitely make it to final list . Moreover,this year AAI has given heights to vacancies and that will push you more closer towards the selection. P.S. - Be patient through the process of selection because it might extend upto November or December till you heard about your selection but final results will be fruitful. Hope it helps!!"},{"instruction":"staying in a 5 star hotel actually worth all the money you pay for?","output":"It depends upon the person choice… yet my personal opinion is not worth paying huge money just to stay for days.

It’s a mode of money transfer from your bank account to the bank account of any other person in India. It’s a faster and safer way of transferring funds electronically between two accounts of different banks.. The fund transfer takes place as per settlement schedules set by RBI, and usually take about an hour to complete. The bank charges are also very minimum.. However, transfer limit is upto two lakhs per transaction.. To use this facility you need to have an internet banking facility to your bank account with your bank. If not, you can walk-in to your bank and get this facility at the bank counter too.. NEFT works only during the banking days. RTGS: Real Time Gross Settlement. It is also similar to NEFT in its operative part. But under RTGS, the fund transfer takes place in real time. And there is no upper limit for the transfer amount. RTGS also works only on the banking days.. IMPS: Immediate Payment Service. This is also a electronic payment system using your mobile phone. Under this mode. the funds are transferred instantaneously between two bank accounts. You can transfer funds by keying in the account number and IFS code of the receiving bank, or by keying in the mobile number of the person to whom you wish to make a payment.. The upper limit of transaction under IMPS is Rs. 50000/- in a day. IMPS works 24/7 and 365 days, including Sundays and holidays. Hope this helps.."},{"instruction":"false surrendering a war crime? Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"Yes, it’s considered a War Crime. A false signal of surrender is defined as “perfidy”, a legal definition of specific acts of treachery prohibited under the 1977 Protocol addressing them added as Article 37 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. I’ve highlighted the sentences relevant to this question in bold print. Article 37. – Prohibition of perfidy It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy:The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; andThe feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict. Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts which are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation. There are specific, internationally and universally recognized signals used for truce and surrender negotiation. There are specific symbols and markings for medical units, facilities and personnel which enjoy a protected status. With extremely rare exception, feigning a surrender results in instant annihilation. It also raises the extreme risk of any future truce or surrender signal being ignored with some justification in doing so. However, an opposing belligerent party disregarding or violating this or any other part of the Hague or Geneva Conventions is not a justification for not abiding by them. I’ve heard numerous arguments regarding how stupid and incongruous these prohibitions are in light of the violence, death and destruction war inflicts on combatants. The rationale is typically war inherently has no rules or “laws” as the objective is killing (annihilating) all the enemy. This kind of justification to ignoring “Laws of War”ignores the fundamental purpose of warfare. Carl von Clausewitz, a very early 19th Century Prussian staff officer put it succinctly in his seminal work, “Vom Kriege” (translation: On War), published a year after his death in 1832: War is the continuation of politics by other means. “Vom Kriege” is required reading for professional military officers. It is one of the most influential works on political-military analysis, theory and strategy ever written. It remains very relevant two centuries later, particularly with strategic thinking and the major considerations in conducting a large military campaign. Warfare is not armed conflict between individuals. It is armed conflict to achieve political goals when diplomatic negotiation to achieve them has failed or is otherwise abandoned. Wars are conducted between sovereign nations (de facto or de jure), quasi-nations, or non-state actors conducting a civil war or insurgencies such as the Taliban and ISIS/ISIL, or non-state proxies such as the Viet Cong acting on behalf of North Vietnam which had its own military forces. Individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines carry out armed conflict on behalf of and as (lawfully) ordered to by their government (or the non-state equivalent). A government may conscript citizens and residents for military service. The conscripted are not volunteers. Refusal to serve when drafted is severely punished; in some nations it’s a capital crime. I emphasize again that warfare is undertaken to forcibly impose the political will of one government or (quasi-)political organization on another, for political goals, whether it’s the Taliban, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, PLO, Hamas, SWAPO, Red Brigades, Red Army Faction (Baader-Meinhof), Confederate States of America, Spain, Great Britain, Imperial Japan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Republic of China, or the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. The individual combatants are the human instruments used to carry it out. The Hague and Geneva Conventions were created to recognize the fundamental difference between belligerent governments or non-state actors, and the individuals they recruit or draft as combatants to carry out their political will. Those who are not taking up arms as combatants, or are no longer taking up arms, are hors de combat (literal translation: “out of the fight”) and have a protected status. This includes those who are attempting to surrender for any number of reasons, to include the inability to continue the use of arms. To willfully and deliberately inflict harm on them serves no legitimately useful purpose toward the political goals of the armed conflict (incident to pursuing legitimate military targets is another matter). It is a War Crime to do so. To feign a legally protected status because violating that is a War Crime, in order to gain a tactical advantage or to conduct an ambush then becomes a War Crime."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

Most Top Secret material and documents are not supposed to leave the area that they are considered safe to be in. If they do leave, they go into a briefcase or other storage container that's got two locks on it, and that particular material is taken from one point to another point by someone that is officially being a courier for that material. It's supposed to go to the place that it was originally packaged to go to, without stopping and being opened. On arrival, it becomes part of the Top Secret inventory of the place that receives it. That's how it stays under control. So one individual is not supposed to be running around with a box full of this stuff because it isn't being transferred on inventory through one account directly to another account. In the event that a new facility is deemed okay for Top Secret information, after receiving proper accreditation through official sources, that place gets listed so it can be inspected from time to time to ensure that the integrity of top secret information continues to be safe. We've heard lots of stories about Donald Trump and Mar-a-Lago, and the answer is at no time did they ever decide that that place was an accredited SCIF for sensitive compartmented information or other classified material. But let's be fair here. Both Mike Pence and Joe Biden have had classified material found in their possession, and the loophole there is that once you have destroyed classified equipment or material or documents, they get documented on an official form and filed with those that are in charge of maintaining integrity of the classified material. Obviously, in cases concerning those two gentleman's access to classified material, people dropped the ball and didn't document where the classified material was and did not use proper channels to either destroy it or store it. I'm beginning to think that maybe I should turn in my armed guard uniform and start being an official inspector of all these sites that are mishandling classified information, because your top leaders don't have a clue what they're in charge of. When things are being run properly, you have separate people in charge of the programs that are doing their job and the government officials have people that are giving good accounting of what's coming through those programs so these blunders don't keep happening. Politics and classified information should not mix."},{"instruction":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","output":"There are ‘’big dogs’’ meaning dog species bigger than domestic dogs.

Sadly, the reality states otherwise. Some people even experienced a moment when they worked harder than ever, yet, they didn’t receive what they want. 2. Getting out of a toxic environment is not an easy decision. It requires more than bravery, particularly when toxic people in the environment hold influential positions. Even secretively planning for move-outs is not an easy thing to think about. 3. Some people choose to keep themselves in unwanted situations. Some examples include housewives who don’t seek jobs despite being unemployed for a long time just for the sake of their abusive husbands, and unhappy employees working in a job they despise for the sake of bettering their economic conditions. 4. Some people struggle to make friends, not because they are the problems (like what they’ve thought after some periods of gaslighting). Instead, they have tasted the bitter medicine of smear campaigns that make them look crazy. 5. It’s not always all about the kindness of people that can take many forms. I’ve been too familiar with the term “tough love”.

It was not a focus of his work, and we don’t have much written evidence of his views. Therefore, it’s dangerous to interpret his few words about Islam as representative of his broader thoughts on the religion. Nietzsche used Islam in multiple ways in his writing, often as a rhetorical device rather than the subject of an in-depth analysis. For example, as Ernst-Otto Onnasch’s answer pointed out, Nietzsche wrote in the Antichist that he admired Moorish and Islamic culture insofar as it was life-affirming. He decried the crusades as a “higher form of piracy, nothing more.” However, if you read the rest of the book, this passage seems very much like a ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’ sort of statement. He despised Christianity because it negates life, it is the religion of pity, and because it has a “vital interest in making mankind sick,” as he wrote in the Antichrist. Thus, to his mostly Christian or former Christian audience, he often wrote about Islam to point out flaws in Christianity. If he wrote more about Islam, I think Nietzsche would have criticized it as well. Perhaps he would have wrote it contained the same fundamental defects as Christianity that make it equally or near-equally as toxic to the human spirit. Unfortunately, we will never know his full thoughts on the subject."},{"instruction":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","output":"Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” is probably the best example I can think of.

Each “news source” reflects the opinion of its stockholders (publishers), and the editorial management: They select what stories they want to cover, and what content they want to put in; they have a limited amount of time (broadcast journalism), or space (print journalism), and must consider the response of their advertisers, and last, their customers. This, along with the consolidation of media; as independent outlets are purchased by ever-larger corporations, most concerned with entertainment, and not information; along with a general deterioration in quality; such as misspelling of commonly used words, and lack of fact-checking; and lack of interest in maintaining a “neutral” stance, or educating the public, via documentaries, and similar types of journalism; places a greater burden on people to select what they should, in the way of information; and most of the public has neither the time, nor the inclination, to do that. The result is, that people tend to “gravitate” toward information sources that reinforce what they already believe; and encourages the owners of the media, increasingly; to inject their points of view; not only in the commercials, and opinion sections and segments; where such bias is advertised, and is therefore; reasonably acceptable, but to the news itself; where it is not. This has been the case, even with public broadcasting, which has had its government funding cut (which, while not perfect; did reflect the opinions of the Public, in general), forcing them to turn, more and more; to donations, most of which are from wealthy individuals, and/or; their foundations; so that Public Broadcasting reflects their opinions, and views. The comments elsewhere on this question; especially in the “definition” of concepts, such as socialism, and conservatism; and the endorsement of certain “outlets”, is indicative of that. Until there is a return to journalistic ethics; the most important of which are: The Public's right to know, and; at least an attempt to put the Public's best interests, primary; and therefore; to strive to provide the Public with the best information, and opinion; available; and to educate them on the intricacies of various issues; which is the purpose of Documentary Journalism; the Public's only option is to obtain as many sources of information, as possible; screen those sources, based on their own experiences; trying to be as neutral as they can, in those evaluations; and eventually, settling on those outlets that have proven “trustworthy”, and discarding, or paying less attention to; the others. This was the job of The Media, but because it is a job they no longer wish to perform, it is up to each of us, and to teach those who will be succeeding generations, how to do this, for themselves."},{"instruction":"What is the most overlooked truth about working in the IT industry?","output":"I like to give you an optimistic side of working in IT You can upskill yourself as long as you are open to learningYou can set your retirement age, You can earn as long as you can codeI strongly believe people working in IT as an Individual Contributor, can write better books than the existing textbooks for students.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"In 1781, The British landed 1600 troops near the mouth of the Thames River in Connecticut. The traitor Benedict Arnold lead 800 troops to New London. The other 800 went to the other bank of the river to attack Fort Griswold, protected by 150 Americans. After two failed attempts to rush the fort, the British tried again and this time a bullet snapped the pole supporting the American flag. While the colonialists tried to hoist the flag, the British took the flag lowering as a surrender. When they calmly marched up the hill to occupy the fort, the colonists opened fire, since they hadn't surrendered and caused many British casualties. When the British did enter the fort, the American Colonel William Ledyard surrendered his sword to the top living British officer, the top two British officers having been killed in the skirmish.

Jackie's last companion, Maurice Templesman, invested her 26 million for her and it grew to 200 million for her children by the time of her death.

Others have suggested many ways. Here are another two ways to do it. PAYTM GOLD If you have a paytm account you can buy gold without taking delivery. Paytm gold offers gold at the current rate. There is no minimum limit to buy gold. You can buy daily if you want. You do not have to buy every month either. Say you want to buy Rs 30 worth of Gold. Let us say the rate of Gold offered is Rs 3280 per gram. That works out to 0.9 mg Gold. If you buy 0.9 mg Gold it gets added into your paytm gold balance. You can get the gold delivered once you reach minimum weight of delivery, which is 1 gm perhaps. This is just an example, there is an added exense per transaction tawhich makes small purchases expensive. You can even sell your gold holdings and get back your money and pocket your profits if the sale price is more than your buying price. TANISHQ Golden Harvest Plan This is a way to purchase Gold physically. You decide to pay say Rs 5000 for 10 months. You accumulate Rs 50,000. On the 11th month you can visit any Tanishq outlet and use your accumulation plus interest to buy gold jewelry. These are two ways to invest in Gold. However, I will not recommend you to invest in Gold for the reasons below. Gold isn't an Asset Class that gives you good returns. Physical Gold needs to be imported. Gold is the second highest item on the import list by value after crude oil. It is a useless metal and does not help the economy. Crude oil is used as input to a long list of value addition chain. Gold and Precious stones are actually imported and value added and exported. But importing gold and paying more than 8% as making charges to make jewelry and then keeping it in your locker is not desirable for the economy. SGB If you really want to invest in gold for the sake of investment, then you can invest in Sovereign Gold Bond. It us equivalent to holding physical gold plus earning an extra interest minus the risk of holding physical gold. RBI announces SGB prices every month. You can but SGB from Retail Banks. You can buy it online and hold it online too."},{"instruction":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","output":"Some people prepared milk, coffee, or something hot than freshly cooked bread.

Now imagine every day of your life is like that. One of my best friends in high school was diagnosed with Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy his senior year. LHON is a degenerative condition, and by his freshman year in college, he'd lost sight in both his eyes. Like me, he was a computer science major, but unlike me, watching him program is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. In college, he used a combination of a screen magnifier and text-to-speech software. The magnifier was called MAGic ( http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/LowVision/MAGic ), which allowed him to blow up the screen to the point of having just a few characters on the monitor at once. The monitor itself was a huge, 30-plus inch projector-looking thing, which had a display optimized for visually-impaired individuals. He preferred JAWS ( http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS ) for text-to-speech, though I remember he tried a bunch of different products. I specifically remember him saying existing open source solutions were a joke in comparison to the mega expensive ones he used (thanks entirely to our school's support). He always had the screen reader set to the fastest possible setting, which was probably upwards of 300 words per minute. For context, audio books are typically read around half that speed. To me, it sounded like a completely different language, but he was fluent. In fact, he preferred to use an absurdly old version of Firefox (3.5 or something), because it had the absolute best support for his screen reader. He used keyboard shortcuts almost exclusively, which allowed him to navigate apps and switch among windows with blazing speed. That, combined with the fact the screen was magnified ~40x, made it nearly impossible to follow what he was doing, but he was much more efficient than many programmers I've seen. On to how he programmed specifically. His editor of choice was emacs (I think because he was already proficient at crazy keyboard shortcuts), and his screen reader would read out code as he scrolled around. Similarly, the screen reader would read the terminal output, so any problem sets whose results couldn't be transformed to text or sound were prohibitive. As you might expect, programming languages are even more difficult to understand than English words. Languages that didn't make heavy use of symbols in their syntax were much easier to understand, though; languages that \\"look\\" like English, aka Python, Ruby, and friends, are more accessible.

According to the Forbes report: “Amazon sales increased over 100 billion, making it one of the highest profit makers and successful retailers in the eCommerce marketplace” (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Forbes] [URL: http://forbes.com/]-2020) Alibaba is a platform that connects different buyers and sellers across the globe.

Key differences between Alibaba and Amazon These giant platforms are playing a significant role in the world of eCommerce businesses. Let’s have a look at the key differences between Amazon and Alibaba. · Business models The business model of Amazon is unique, which gives plenty of opportunities to the sellers entering into the market. Amazon sells products directly to its customers. Furthermore, customers can buy the products from third-party retailers. This platform is much more developed than Alibaba. Amazon offers many services to its consumers, such as fast shipping, Amazon Prime, Amazon FBA, and many significant web services. To increase its overall sales, Amazon charges its sellers for every completed sale. “More than 50% of Amazon’s marketplace sales come from third-party sellers”.

There are various aspects of this platform that made the growth possible. Since its establishment, it has expanded its business to many international markets across the world.

Moreover, it offers Amazon Prime Services to its premium members, including video streaming, Amazon original T.V. shows, playlists, and millions of songs. However, Alibaba does not offer such services, which narrows its market share. · Inventory Alibaba acts as a middleman between the sellers and buyers in the eCommerce market. It does not own the inventory of the merchandise sold. However, Amazon owns the stock and sells the products directly to its customers. Moreover, Amazon has its warehouses where they store the inventory and then ship the products to their customers · Profitability ratio Alibaba performs much better in terms of earning profit.

When you make a habit of feeling stress and anxiety, you are more prone to feel it in similar situations in the future. It's like when parents or society train you to feel shame for certain undesirable behaviors and that becomes a habitual response to those circumstances. You also get trained to feel pride and satisfaction as a result of certain outcomes in a way that is not innate. A lot of habitual stress and anxiety comes from worrying about relatively constant aspects of our lives, like our financial situation or relationship status. Some comes from difficult to avoid circumstances like occasionally realizing you've said something inaccurate in an attempt to try to make people like you and worrying later that they'll think you're full of crap. The obvious part of avoiding this stress is to make self improvements but the harder part is to realize that you'll never be perfect and try to stop distracting yourself from better things with too much unproductive rumination. If you spend a lot of time on unproductive rumination, not only do you have less energy for self improvement and pursuit of a life worth living, but you just don't have as much time and energy to feel emotions about other things. You can get addicted to this stress because its own intensity can sort of compel you to focus on it, because the intensity makes it feel important. When you start to feel other emotions, you might half consciously think “wait, I need to feel that stress again so I can focus on fixing myself\\", thus overriding and erasing those emotions. Those other emotions eventually get unlearned and, when you get exhausted from the stress and choose to forget about it, there's often just an empty, sort of numb feeling left because you conditioned yourself repeatedly to stop feeling other emotions in a wide variety of situations. You may have also trained yourself to not seek activities and scenarios which are conducive to those other emotions in favor of focussing on the stress. To unlearn this, you have to do the same thing in the opposite fashion, which will take some focus and dedication because those other emotions are not usually as intensely compelling, because you don't think they're going to help you focus on behavioral self improvement: they just make you feel good. It is the case however, in this situation, that focusing on those more positive emotions IS the path to self improvement, internally and externally. It will help you feel less exhausted and stuck. When you notice yourself getting stressed, try to calm down, think of a logical, reasonably achievable plan to address the issues that are stressing you out, and commit to not feeling stressed anymore because you've already come up with a plan to follow, so just follow the plan and try to enjoy the rest of your life. When an interesting feeling happens and stress or over analysis tries to interrupt it, tell yourself to forget about that for now, because you have to prioritize retraining yourself to hold onto good and interesting feelings again, and worry about reevaluating plans after you've enjoyed your positive experience. If you ever get stressed about failing to properly follow your plan, revise it to be more achievable for your human limitations and constricting circumstances, and dismiss the stress again. Understand that life isn't about improving as fast as you can until you're dead. It's about feeling good, having a diversity of experiences, and engaging with passion to achieve fulfillment. Self improvement is an ingredient in this, but it's a tool to achieve these things, so don't let it take up so much of your time and energy that there's nothing left for the goals the self improvement is supposed to help achieve. There's a balance to be struck between responsibility and enjoyment, and not letting your emotional experience get bogged down with unproductive rumination is a very important part of that balance. One of the ways I find it easier to be nicer to myself when I'm too self critical is to think of myself as a separate person whom I wouldn't be so harsh with. I think something like “it's okay buddy, don't be so hard on yourself. Just chill for a minute\\". If you could see into someone else's mind going through this you would feel compassion. Feel that compassion for yourself. Check out some articles about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help strategize for retraining your mind. Also, if it's ever legalized as a treatment, psilocybin has been shown to be helpful in this process, but I'm not suggesting anyone do anything illegal or dangerous.

I am sure that my IQ is high, because I was successful in chess and math competitions on country level. I was coming to special math classes and I was getting advanced tests from math. The question is what I did earn in my life. I did not finished university, because I needed a special approach of teachers. Public schools will not give you the approach. Then, I was without money and job. I was making money by coming on exams for another students and doing their tests and home works. I was taking monthly wage for one “visit”. It was only one resource of money for me. They are talking that this business in not fair. But, imagine some girls are poor from math and they want to finish the school. What they supposed to do? They will come to me and will say: “I need to know math statistics, teach me.” But, this is mission impossible holding deadlines. There is only way how to help them to go on the exams. The result is: I do not have a school. If I will apply for a job what makes sense for me to do, I will not get it. It is two totally different thinks for me: “I had statistics in the school.” and “I know statistics.” If you will say: “I know statistics”, it is very strong sentence on interview and they do not believe you. But, help came from Cambridge in my life. I told them about my problem. And they told me: you will get a title from us, but you have to pass by all exams without strict rules and conditions when to come to exam. This was very fair for me. :-"},{"instruction":"What industries need lead generation and marketing?","output":"Lead generation and marketing are essential for businesses across various industries.

A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. A chocolate holding tank, also called a chocolate tempering tank or chocolate melting tank, is a piece of equipment used in the chocolate manufacturing process. It is used to melt and hold chocolate at a specific temperature, usually around 45-50 degrees Celsius (113-122 degrees Fahrenheit), in order to make it easier to work with and to ensure a smooth texture in the finished product.

However in reality, some of this was exaggerated. Perhaps 2–10 of Scots were Catholic in the 17th century.

In simpler terms, when you want to access a website or any online resource, you send a request, and this request passes through the proxy server first before it goes to the web server. The web server responds back to the proxy server, and the proxy server then forwards the response to you. Let's illustrate this with an example. Imagine you are at work, and you want to access a website that is blocked by your company's firewall. You try to access the website directly, but the firewall blocks your request. Now, if you use a proxy server, you can bypass the firewall. You send your request to the proxy server, and the proxy server sends the request to the website. The website sees the request as coming from the proxy server, not your company's network, so it responds. The proxy server receives the response and forwards it to you, enabling you to see the content of the website. There are several types of proxy servers, including HTTP proxies, HTTPS proxies, SOCKS proxies, and more, each serving a specific purpose and providing various security levels. But why use a proxy server? Anonymity: A proxy server hides your IP address, providing a level of anonymity while browsing the internet. The website you're accessing sees the proxy server's IP address, not yours. Security: Proxy servers can provide additional security by providing a protective layer between your computer and the internet. This can help protect against malware, hackers, and other security threats. Circumvent Geo-Blocking and Censorship: As in the earlier example, proxy servers can help bypass geo-blocking or censorship by making it appear as if your web traffic is coming from a different location. Control and Monitor Internet Usage: In an organization, proxy servers can be used to control and monitor employees' internet usage. It can prevent access to specific websites or online resources, and it can also monitor and log web browsing activities. Faster Speeds and Bandwidth Saving: Some proxy servers can cache (store a copy of) web pages and files accessed through them. When a cached page or file is requested again, it can be retrieved from the proxy server much more quickly, saving bandwidth and speeding up access. However, it is essential to use a trustworthy proxy server. An untrustworthy or compromised proxy server could provide false data or use its position to intercept, view, or change your communications. As with any technology, it's essential to understand how it works. When you [LINKED_TEXT: create your own mobile proxy] [URL: https://proxywave.io/], you have more control over its reliability and the assurance that it hasn't been compromised, helping you to use the technology more responsibly and ethically."},{"instruction":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","output":"Hi, You might not know this fact that why these types of agenda’s only comes up just before the Hindu's festivals.

I often get it at an Indian restaurant, in bulk, and bring it home for other uses. At stores, you can find bite sized Naan that are great for appetizers, or more of the traditional sized- about the size of two pieces of sandwich bread put together. Its very thin, so you really taste the toppings, rather than the bread, as you do on a sandwich. That makes it great for mopping up Indian sauces that are too good to leave on the dish. But, I totally ignore custom (I'll probably get nasty comments for not using it properly), but, I enjoy it in the following ways: Mix a little butter, cinnamon, and sugar and cut the Naan into strips. Cover each strip with the toppings, and bake until warm and melted. Make garlic bread with the Naan. Grill it, and top with a little olive oil or butter. Use it toasted with Nutella or cookie butter. Any other dips, spreads, peanut butter, etc, also work. But, one of my sisters is pregnant right now, and as soon as she walks in, she heads to my kitchen, knowing I stock Nutella or cookie butter (Trader Joe's), and Naan, just for her right now. If there is only one piece of Naan left, I won't eat it, knowing she'll want it. Why she can't buy her own, I have yet to figure out. Add cream cheese, shrimp/lox, garlic, thinly sliced red onion, lemon/lime juice, and capers. Especially good on garlic flavored Naan. But, as you can tell, I have a garlic fetish. This is weird, but very good. Make a modified, small Greek salad using finely chopped lettuce, Feta, diced tomatoes, onions, and banana pepper rings. Toss the salad with a Greek dressing, or any vinegarette. You can add protein like shredded chicken, lamb/gyro slices, beef tips, shrimp, etc to the salad if desired.Coat the Naan with olive oil, and a bit of garlic (or garlic powder), and toast.Put the salad on the toasted Naan.Top with a sliced cheese- provolone, gouda, Fontina, muenster, etc all work great. Place the Naan back in the oven until the cheese melts.Enjoy! Also good with Tahiti or tzatziki (cucumber) sauces, and extra dressing on the side. My nieces and nephews call these Salad Pizzas. They're good for traditional homemade pizza as well, but, I try to sneak in more veggies. If you ever use flat pita bread (versus pita pockets) you can substitute Naan for a change. Just have fun coming up with different possibilities."},{"instruction":"w does the Canadian healthcare system prevent people from going to the doctor excessively when they aren't sick, with no copays and deductibles?","output":"Another loaded question from one of our transatlantic colleagues keen to impose their own pathetic excuse of a health system elsewhere in the world.

No, they are there to a) make the insurance company money b) to make POOR people not visit the doctor so often Any medical authority in the world will tell you early intervention is the key to addressing medical issues. Discouraging people from doing so just makes it more likely that when they do attend a doctor or a hospital, the issue will be a lot more serious.

And we have been consuming a lot of sugar, often unknowingly. Back in the 1950s, animal fat/lard was fingered as a major source of heart issues and cholesterol issues. It was recommended then that fat be limited/reduced in the American diet so instead of using animal fats, food manufacturers made substitutes such as vegetable oil for cooking and margarine to replace butter for baked goods and processed foods. Chicken and fish replaced beef. But when that is done, you take away a lot of flavor. As many people who are serious cooks will tell you, fat=flavor. Margarine doesn’t taste like butter. Taking out lard as a cooking agent changes the flavor profile and mouth feel of sauces, baked goods, fried foods and other dishes—let’s face it, bacon grease makes foods taste MUCH better than olive oil. Frying something in lard is far more tasty than frying it in vegetable oil. So sugar was increasingly added to processed foods as well as condiments/sauce mixes, and salad dressings in order to cover up the lack of flavor. So now, if you go to the store, pick up a boxed or canned anything and look at the label, you will see sugar as a main ingredient, even in foods that you wouldn’t think would contain it, like savory sauces and foods, salad dressings or condiments. The upshot is that now, sugar is consumed a lot, more so than it was 60 years ago. Most Americans who use boxed or canned foods or pre made mixes for sauces and dressings are consuming a LOT of sugar and they don’t know they are. So many are attempting to cut back by not buying boxed or canned/processed foods or using sugar substitutes in their drinks, baking or cooking."},{"instruction":"Why do so many students in India study engineering?

I'd be happy to explain the responsibilities of a business analyst. In a nutshell, a business analyst plays a crucial role in helping organizations identify and address their business needs and challenges. They act as a bridge between business stakeholders and the technical team, ensuring that the right solutions are developed to meet the organization's goals. Let's dive into some specific responsibilities of a business analyst: 1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis: One of the primary responsibilities of a business analyst is to gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders. This involves conducting interviews, workshops, and meetings to understand the business processes, goals, and objectives. The business analyst then translates these requirements into a clear and concise format that can be easily understood by the development team. 2. Documentation and Communication: Business analysts are responsible for documenting the requirements, specifications, and any changes throughout the project lifecycle. They create documents such as business requirement documents (BRDs), functional requirement documents (FRDs), and use cases. Effective communication skills are essential as business analysts need to collaborate with various stakeholders, including business managers, developers, and testers, to ensure everyone is on the same page. 3. Solution Assessment and Validation: Once the solution is implemented, business analysts assess its effectiveness by conducting tests, analyzing data, and gathering feedback from users. They validate whether the solution meets the defined requirements and aligns with the business objectives. If there are any issues or gaps, the business analyst works with the team to identify solutions and implement necessary changes. 4. Stakeholder Management: Business analysts act as a liaison between business stakeholders and the technical team. They facilitate communication, manage expectations, and ensure that all stakeholders are involved and informed throughout the project. Building strong relationships and understanding the needs of various stakeholders is crucial to the success of a business analyst. These are just a few key responsibilities of a business analyst. The role can vary depending on the organization and the specific project. Business analysts need to be adaptable, analytical, and have a strong understanding of both business and technology to effectively contribute to the success of an organization."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for smoother free motion quilting?","output":"Drink two glasses of wine to loosen up. Also, aside from just practicing a lot and preparing your work, there are some accessories I find to be helpful. Having as much flush work space as possible helps a lot. If your machine takes an extension bed, get one. There are third-party companies that can make one specific to your machine. Better yet, get a sewing cabinet with an insert for your machine, so that you have an entire, large desk flush with your machine’s bed to lay your quilt on. I really like Koala Cabinets. They make awesome furniture, and the inserts are made of the same material as the cabinet. There are also low-friction products- silicone sheets that you can apply to your extension bed, or silicone sprays that lubricate the sewing surface your quilt sits on without leaving a residue, stains, or odors. It’s non-toxic. It’s basically the same thing they spray on baking molds as a release agent for baked goods, so purchasing food-grade silicone spray is probably the EXACT same product. I don’t think these products are very useful, but it’s worth a try. Try some different presser feet. I worked primarily with Brother, Baby Lock, and Bernina, and they have a wide range of presser feet for free-motion embroidery that might work better for you. Beware that not all free-motion feet will work with all machines, even if they’re of the same universal low-shank presser foot design. Try a new machine. If you’re like most quilters I’ve met, then quilting is your passion. New, awesome machines from leading brands are priced really low at the moment. Here are a few incentives to upgrading, and I apologize for making assumptions to you personally; this is a public answer for everyone. A larger machine means a larger throat area, giving you more space to the right of the needle to work with. This is probably the most coveted of quilting features. Straight-stitch only machine’s with large throats from brands like Baby Lock and Juki can be had for around 1k and they include a very large and well-made extension bed. Many brands will have models that feature an automatic presser foot height adjustment with feedback. Essentially, this means that rather than an embroidery foot that goes up and down with every stroke of the needle, a presser foot with no moving parts will lower down to the height of the fabric and come back up about 0.5mm. The foot floats above the fabric, just low enough to allow the stitch to form properly, but not low enough to press onto the fabric and create resistance. It’s awesome. It’s like sewing on a cloud, and you don’t have the constant racket of a traditional free-motion foot clanking away and ruining your wine buzz. If you’re into Bernina, they have some machines that work with a special device called a Bernina Stitch Regulator, or BSR. The BSR is a free-motion embroidery foot that contains a small led and an optical sensor. It reads the speed at which you move your quilt, and adjusts the main motor speed accordingly, so that regardless of how quickly you’re moving, you maintain the same stitch length. It operates on the same principle as a computer mouse, which reads the mousepad and determines how fast and in what direction you’re moving the mouse. I can’t decide whether or not it’s a crutch, a training aid, or a modern convenience, but it does work well. A BERNINA 530 sewing machine and a BSR could be had new from a dealer for probably around 2,200USD (the 530 lists at 1,499.99) before tax, which is one of the better values in sewing machines at the moment. That’s all I can think of. Like others have said, the most important thing is practice. Everything I’ve mentioned is just to offer a more enjoyable and less frustrating quilting experience, because if I’m frustrated and fussing with my work and I can’t enjoy it, I will invariably do a bad job. All product recommendations are my personal opinion, and I don’t profit from anyone going out and buying a Bernina or a Koala cabinet or anything like that."},{"instruction":"Amazon a second tier tech company?","output":"After working for more than 4 years at Amazon I am working at Facebook now. I can most certainly say that Amazon has tons of technical challenges that any software engineer would love to work on. From my experience, its challenges are much more diverse and harder than Facebook. AWS itself can be a separate company in the same league as Google, Facebook etc. It also certainly has superior architecture and lots of smart engineers. The senior engineers are really smart and the principal engineers I worked there with were super smart, capable of working at Google, Facebook, Apple any day. What is wrong with Amazon is it does not care about its employees at all and I think it comes from the very top, the C.E.O. In my opinion Jeff is not bothered about providing good benefits to his employees and is comfortable with the steady flow of outgoing employees. He simply doesn’t care and won’t care as long as he can hire to fill the vacancies. The idea is to burn out the engineers and then replace them with fresh energetic people. And this is what directly or indirectly is creating a bad image of the company to the software engineer community. This makes one think why he would work at Amazon if he can work at a similar big tech company with much better benefits and perks. In short, Amazon’s benefits, perks and caring of its employees are second tier but the technology and quality of engineers are not."},{"instruction":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","output":"Potassium superoxides absorb carbondioxide and releases oxygen. 4KO2 + CO2 →2 K2CO3 +2 O2"},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter.

But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby."},{"instruction":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","output":"There is really no true genuine person to perfection existing on earth is an intuitive guess because people get selfdeceived or lie a lot .

How can I keep going along with my diet?","output":"Most diets are designed to lose weight over the short term and have a focus on weight and not holistic health—as in nutrition and disease prevention/healing through whole plant foods. Consequently, most diets use caloric restriction and just eating less of the food that naturally leads to weight gain. Which will lead your body craving and needing more. Now, a caloric deficit is necessary to lose weight. Yet one can and ideally achieves this through actually eating more! The key to losing weight isn’t eating less, but actually eating MORE of the right foods. vegetarians, especially vegans, have consistently shown to have lower and normal BMI’s compared to omnivores or pescatarians for the main reason that they eat more fruits and vegetables which are naturally low in calories. By eating more fruits and vegetables you can eat more, fill up your stomach, and satisfy your hunger and nutritional needs, while still reaching your weight goals. a clear strategy can give us our best results. But diets often fail because they are meant to. When trying to maintain our weight it is best to approach it from an education and holistic health mindset then trying to punish ourselves just to lose a few pounds at any consequence. This is all of course easier said than done. Knowing that we should do something is NOT that same as understanding why we should do it or how to do it.

They are also able to motivate others to follow them by sharing their vision and driving them towards a common goal. Decisive leaders know what needs to be done in order to achieve a desired outcome and are not afraid to make tough decisions. They also have the ability to communicate effectively and motivate their team members through example. Lastly, a good leader is able to connect with people on an emotional level.

But it’s not for everyone. To me, this is one of the greatest songs ever made. To most people I know, this sounds like horrible noise. The last time I remember any punk I liked being relatively popular, my friends and I were playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. And that was about 20 years ago. Even then, most kids my age were into pop and rap. There are plenty of cult punk bands I think are excellent. My favorite punk band that I never see mentioned on Quora is Strung Out. But I don’t expect punk rock to ever be mainstream. It’s a very specific music style that hasn’t changed all that much. And when I hear newer musicians copy the older pop-punk style I grew up with, well… It’s not the worst music I’ve ever heard, but it doesn’t personally interest me much. Punk got stagnant.

What do I do?","output":"How are you defining “progress?” For years I had a physically demanding job working with toddlers. It required me to be on my feet most of an 8 hour shift, plus I did a lot of lifting (diaper changes every 2 hours). I walked 1 - 2 miles 3 - 4 nights a week. Later, I joined a gym and was living in NYC where I did a ton of walking on a regular basis. I felt good. The working out made my head feel clearer and the endorphin rush was always nice. I was slowly able to do more with each workout. But I didn’t see any “progress.” Despite my improved mental health, despite the ability to steadily do a little bit more each time, I thought I was failing. Why? It didn’t help me lose weight, and that’s how I was measuring “progress.” My body size didn’t get smaller, so clearly I was doing it “wrong.” When I tried harder, it didn’t change. When I ate less it didn’t change. When I ate more it didn’t change. So, although I kept going to the gym hoping it would change, I stopped reaping all the mental health benefits. It became a chore. It became something I was “supposed” to do or “had” to do. I developed fibromyalgia at 25, although it would be 8 long, painful, debilitating years of being told by everyone (myself included) that I needed to “just lose weight” before I got diagnosed. I had an injury caused by that - my thigh muscle has a tendency to get very tight. If I try to exercise when that happens, it will tug my kneecap out of position. I had to stop going to the gym. By then the pain was so bad the only machine I could use was a treadmill, which just happened to be the thing that exacerbated my knee injury the most. I was getting physical therapy, but my therapist had to unexpectedly move back to Ukraine, and find a non-fat-shaming anything in NYC is hard enough once. I didn’t imagine I’d strike gold twice, and I didn’t pursue further PT. I honestly believe if she hadn’t had to move I may have gotten my fibro diagnosis a lot sooner. I think she was on to it. But I digress. The point is, you may need to reconsider your personal definition of “progress.” I wish I had. Then I could’ve enjoyed the exercise without the expectation, and I’d still have benefited from it physically - and mentally - without the number on the scale or my pants size changing."},{"instruction":"Will Node.js replace many backend technologies?","output":"What is Dynamic SEO?

As for mains plugs, considering that some standards use the same sized pins for all three conductors (live, neutral and Earth), and their difference in some particular countries but not others can only be put down to fashion. Australian plugs/sockets have three identical sized flat pins for mains, and we pack 230 volts in the mains (used to be 240v).

This 1965 novel is set in the distant future and tells the story of a desert planet named Arrakis, the only source of a valuable spice called \\"mélange,\\" and the political and religious conflict surrounding it.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" by Douglas Adams. This comedic science fiction series, which began as a radio play in 1978, follows the adventures of an unwitting human and his alien friend as they travel through space.\\"Neuromancer\\" by William Gibson. This 1984 novel is considered a classic of the cyberpunk genre and is set in a dystopian future where the world is controlled by a mysterious artificial intelligence.\\"Foundation\\" by Isaac Asimov. Originally published in 1951, this series of short stories and novels is set in a distant future where humanity is ruled by a group of scientists known as the \\"Foundation.\\"\\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card. This 1985 novel is set in the future where humanity is at war with an alien species and follows the story of a child prodigy who is trained to become a military commander.\\"The Time Machine\\" by H.G.

Another Wells classic, it was published in 1898, it is the story of an invasion of Earth by Martians.\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by Margaret Atwood. This dystopian novel from 1985 is set in a future where the United States has been replaced by a theocratic, totalitarian regime and tells the story of a woman who is forced into sexual slavery. These are some of the best-known and widely considered as classics, but many other novels and series also deserve to be considered among the best science fiction novels, depending on the taste of the reader."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","output":"Well, Before getting into Competitive Programming, It's very important to have proper knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. After having adequate knowledge of DSA, you can blindly move towards Competitive Programming. It's very important to have a clear mindset towards Competitive Programming and Data structures and Algorithms. First of all, Competitive Programming has various rules. The participants need to write code under various restrictions like memory limits, execution time, the limit of coding, space, etc. So, here Asymptotic Notation comes into the picture. In this, there will be learning about How can you make your algorithms more efficient or more optimized by reducing their time and space complexity. Basically, this concept is very important, or I can say it is a building block of CP. Competitive Programming is nothing if one does not solve problem-solving questions. So for solving questions of CP, prefer CodeChef, Codeforces and Leetcode. So for that, Make your profile on competitive programming websites which I have mentioned above. This will subscribe you to their mailing list and you will get emails for their next competition on a regular basis. But it feels really demotivated when we couldn’t solve more than 2 questions in Contest. So, I would recommend you all to take a proper structured course of Competitive Programming where you’ll get knowledge of CP from the Scratch. The most commonly used websites for CP courses are as follows: Coding Blocks Coding Minutes Coding Ninjas Unacademy Geeks for Geeks For learning CP, I took the help of the Coding Ninjas CP course of C++. For me, Coding Ninjas served as a saviour because I was really scared about how to start and how can I go further in CP. so, I started learning CP from Coding Ninjas. The thing that I liked the most about [LINKED_TEXT: Coding Ninjas] [URL: https://www.codingninjas.com/] was that they provide teaching assistance where they solve our every doubt almost 24/7. we can even take free trials in order to know more about the course and their teaching ability. Once we complete the course and our performance is good then we receive a certificate of completion as well. and we can opt for internships provided by Coding Ninjas, one of them is of Teaching assistant where we can even earn a stipend. They provide a well-design course structure in which they cover all the essential topics of CP with every little question. Once you are completing this course, Don’t ever forget to code daily. Choose Hackerrank at first for coding then switch towards CodeChef, Codeforces and Leetcode for solving Problem-solving Questions. After Solving these questions daily, you will acquire proper knowledge of CP. Now you are good enough to give Contests and score well. See before moving towards contests, have a proper understanding of different contests, Long contests:CodeChef long contests run for about 2 weeks. They start on the first Friday of every month (which is an advantage as you will have the whole weekend to code.). For you as Beginner, I would recommend this contest. You will have enough time to learn concepts during the contest itself. Also, there is no penalty for wrong submissions so you can take your time to code and debug your solutions.Short contests:These are for a short duration (about 2 hours) with 3 to 5 problems of varying difficulty. If you have limited time, this is your best option. There are websites that hold short contests regularly: Topcoder (2-3 times a month), Codechef ( once a month) and Codeforces (2-3 times a month). Short contests test your speed and accuracy to the limit. Start giving Contests on regular basis. I would suggest you not to skip any contests for almost 2–4 months. NOTE: Don't wait for any roadmaps, any guidance, any magic. There is no such thing. Only your efforts and consistency helps you in getting closer to Success. Nobody becomes a 5–6 star in 2-3 months. Everything requires rigorous hard work for at least 1 year continuously.Continuity is very important.

It has nothing to do with observation or measurement. The “wave function” “collapses” when a particle or wave is physically connected (entangled?) with a macroscopic object. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says there is some uncertainty in the physical state of an object. It’s not that you can’t measure precisely, but that the exact values of physical parameters don’t exist. The uncertainty is large compared with the parameters of elementary particles, but negligible compared with the parameters of macroscopic objects. Consider the thought experiment called “Schrödinger’s cat.” A cat and a radioactive substance are put in a box, along with a mechanism consisting of a particle detector, a hammer and a vial to poison gas. If the detector detects a particle emitted from the radioactive substance, it actuates the hammer, which breaks the vial, killing the cat. The box is closed, and opened later when the estimated probability that the cat is dead is about one-half. At the instant before the box is opened, it’s not true that the cat is described by a wave function that defines it to be both dead and alive with some probability of each. The cat is a macroscopic object, not subject to Heisenberg uncertainty. At any moment between the time the box is closed and when it’s opened, the cat is either alive or dead. If it is killed, there is therefore an exact time when it died, even though that time will not be known when the box is opened. That parameter exists, and has an exact value, even though it won’t be observed. On the other hand, the exact position and velocity of the detected particle will have no precise values, because they are irrelevant to the state of the cat. Only the fact that the detector detected a particle at a certain time has any truth. In all this description of the thought experiment I haven’t said anything about observation or measurement causing the “collapse of the wave function.” The cause is simply that Heisenberg uncertainty doesn’t apply to macroscopic objects. More generally, it isn’t the act of measurement that collapses the wave function. It’s the fact that the measurement apparatus, which is a macroscopic object, is part of the system that defines the state of the particle. Side comment: It’s not quite true that the exact time of the cat’s death can’t be observed. If we know what happens to a cat’s body after death, we can estimate the time of death—or we can choose not to. Now: is it reasonable to suppose that the wave function further collapses, to give a value to the time of death, only if we choose to examine the cat’s body to observe that parameter? How does a wave function collapse in quantum mechanics/physics?"},{"instruction":"attending your youngest daughter's wedding in direct violation of a protective/restraining order a bad idea even if you have a wellrehearsed apology speech attheready?","output":"I like this question!

Bacon has an excellent answer. I just want to add 3 things: They weigh less than do water-cooled engines of the same power output. Weight is everything in aircraft design, so that is important.2. Navies, in particular the USN, preferred radial engines because if a cylinder is damaged (say a bullet), the engine can continue to operate, at least for a while, which is especially important for crews flying over water. Maybe they can get back to the ship, or at least get closer. Whereas with a liquid-cooled engine, one shot in the radiator, and you are done quickly.3. The downside to radial engines is that they run hotter, in general, than water cooled engines, meaning they require more maintenance and have a shorter lifespan. And there proved to be limits on how powerful they could make the engines, for when they went to 3 & 4 rows of cylinders, reliability plummeted. B-29’s had overheating problems, and later aircraft, like the B-36 and DC-7’s, had real engine reliability problems. The B-36 had 6 radial engines, each engine had 28 cylinders, and 2 spark plugs per cylinder (standard for aircraft), so a basic servicing required replacing 336 spark plugs!"},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"Hi He is one of the Biggest Super Star if not the No 1 Super Star!.

My view is, that ADHD is more like a personal characteristic than a disease, although it causes some ‘atypical’ behaviors. I think people with ADHD are within normal spectrum of human behavior, although they do have difficulties in some aspects of modern life. My understanding is, that ADHD has become an issue only recently, because modern life causes difficulties that just didn't exist before. So, my answer to the question would be, that ADHD in itself does not require medication, but it may limit for example the options of suitable professions. It is also essential to understand your limitations and make changes to adapt to them. So I would say, that it is possible to learn to live with the condition. I personally didn't even know about my condition until in my 30s. But the diagnosis has definitely helped me in understanding my difficulties in certain aspects of my life. Another thing entirely is, that people with ADHD may develop other conditions, such as anxiety, that may require medication to control properly. I have personally suffered from a generalized anxiety disorder since I was a teenager. ADHD medication may help in relieving anxiety by making more manageable the problems that cause anxiety. Also, I have experienced, that the stimulant medication makes for example social situations easier to manage. It also helps in work tasks that require concentration. So, I think that while ADHD does not make me 'abnormal', it is a handicap that causes me difficulties, so it is ok to take advantage of anything that helps in coping with them. It is a similar thing as eyeglasses for a myopic person (such as myself)."},{"instruction":"What exercise can lose face fat?","output":"Reducing face fat is a common goal for many people who are looking to achieve a more sculpted and toned facial appearance.

Here is an example workflow that you can use: Load the image into Python using OpenCV's imread() function. import cv2 image = cv2.imread('image.jpg') Convert the image to grayscale using OpenCV's cvtColor() function. gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) Apply a Gaussian blur to the grayscale image to reduce noise and smooth out the edges of the object. This can be done using OpenCV's GaussianBlur() function. blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0) Use OpenCV's threshold() function to create a binary mask of the image, where the object of interest is white and the background is black. There are various thresholding methods that can be used, such as Otsu's method or adaptive thresholding. _, thresh = cv2.threshold(blur, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY+cv2.THRESH_OTSU) Apply a morphological operation, such as erosion or dilation, to the binary mask to further refine the salient object. This can be done using OpenCV's morphologyEx() function. kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (5, 5)) morphed = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel) Find the contours of the salient object in the binary mask using OpenCV's findContours() function.

By that I mean, use the radiation directly without so many conversions, i.e. radiationheatsteammechanicalelectricty?","output":"Since there is no meaningful answer so far: what you mean is “direct energy conversion”, or in the case of nuclear energy a fission fragment reactor. “Radiation” plays little role in the energy conversions inside a nuclear reactor. Gamma and beta radiation are produced, but they carry only a few percent of the energy. Nuclear energy mostly manifests in the kinetic energy of the fission fragments. When a fission occurs, the mass of the fission products is less than the mass of the parent nucleus (mass deficit). This mass has turned into energy which accelerates the fission products. On a macroscopic scale this rise in kinetic energy manifests as heat. Instead of using a conventional heat engine with a steam turbine as existing nuclear reactors do, it is conceptually possible to convert the kinetic energy of the fission fragments directly into electricity. The fission products are positively charged nuclei (ions). You can collate the ions (for example with a magnetic mirror) into a charged particle beam which you direct towards a magnetic field to decelerate it. This way the kinetic energy of the ions is turned into electric voltage. Such a power plant could reach much higher efficencies than conventional steam power plants and produce little waste heat. It also would allow for isotopic separation of the fission products, so it would be easier to reprocess nuclear waste and separate useful isotopes like strontium-90 (used as thermonuclear fuel in space probes). So far no prototype has ever been built and very little research has been done in this field. A fission fragment reactor would reduce fuel costs, but probably enhance construction costs which in nuclear energy is generally a bad trade-off, because construction costs are much higher than fuel costs. Currently there seems to be little interest in this kind of power technology."},{"instruction":"w do I tell my grandma about wanting to wear a diaper?

So the person slipped into my DMs to debate over this. What made me feel sick and disgusted is- Not only does this person think it's okay to slut shame girls, he also tried to justify domestic violence saying it's mostly because girls hide their PREVIOUS affairs, the ones that they had BEFORE marriage. Since I was against his ideas, he assumed I'm a non virgin too (which I'm not but that's irrelevant tbh) and then proceeded to slut shame me, called me a prostitute and insulted my parents too. Why? Because he thinks it's okay to slut shame nom virgin girls and because he thinks domestic violence is okay. Not only this, but he asked another question on quora asking whether it's okay to “burst open her eyes” referring to his wife, who accidentally broke his iphone. I was so annoyed at this point, I pointed out that he has a shitty mentality and needs a psychologist after which he verbally abused and then blocked me. I know I shouldn't be exposing his name but at this point idc, his name is Rohit Bisht. I have attached screenshots of the chats. You can have a look at his previous answers and you'll find out how cheap his mentality is. I'm surprised such people still exist in 2020. Can't even imagine how he treats his wife and how she tolerates him."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"Best advice I ever got: every time you do any work on your research write something. Even if it is only one sentence. Even if you end up deleting it later in favour of something better. One of the biggest problems that PhD students have is that they do tons and tons of research and then decide to start writing to be confronted by a blank page. And it is hugely intimidating, and a big reason why people fail to complete. If you keep writing stuff as you go along then firstly you don’t have the blank page problem. But secondly, as your research progresses you will think about stuff you have already written and how you now need to modify it - it is a lot easier to modify stuff you have already written. Thus when it comes to crunch time, you will already have a lot of your core ideas written down in various stages of developmental maturity. Do not be that person who gets to their final year and has barely written anything, and it is just all too much."},{"instruction":"Would living on the ceiling of a mined out area inside a fast rotating asteroid be more feasible than fully constructing a space colony station?","output":"There’s a lot of engineering issues involved, so a simple yes or know is impossible at this time. But here are some of the factors. Asteroids go through most of their existence with little net gravitational force compressing them. Therefore spinning one is likely to make it disintegrate.Asteroids have never been exposed to atmosphere. For this reason the are probably “leaky“.Asteroids are relatively moving bodies which ideally cannot be moved much for construction purposes. To prepare one for habitation would be a lengthy and expensive operation, and the work crew would need to live somewhere, and thus a station would be required from the beginning. The saving grace of an asteroid colony is the availability of raw materials and defence against the environment itself. From this perspective we can analyse colonisation using historical data. Successful and sustainable human colonies have always been located primarily on sources of water, land that can sustain agriculture and provide minerals for growth, so I propose that this would also influence the establishment of space colonies. They would logically build the first stations on rich asteroids, then expand both into and out from the asteroid. I’d suggest that habitats with small rotating zones would come first, as large rotating habitats provide more engineering challenges and maintenance issues. A rotating asteroid is unlikely, but a tethered asteroid as a counter mass to a spinning base is far more attractive. The base would then be significantly lighter than the asteroid so that the forces on the asteroid are not great enough to fragment it. So my answer is that asteroids would definitely be a part of space colonisation, but there would not likely be many spinning asteroids."},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"Having been on both sides of that situation I would say no. It’s possible that you were misjudged, but generally once you’ve been rejected it’s time to move on. Candidates get rejected for many reasons, some substantial, some trivial, but once that choice is made it’s tougher to reverse that judgment than it is to move on. The hiring company has a vision of what that new employee is like in terms of skills, attitude, education, and experience. Just because they haven’t found the right person doesn’t mean they’ve revised their concept of who they want.

It was hard but in many ways, a blessing. I ignored the news. Screw it. I leaned in and hustled. Had to. We had no money and no VC or investment. Totally bootstrapped. You can get a little panicky when you read the news or listen to it but I chose to take more action. Do more. Faster. The environment changes and sometimes gets harder. So what. It's good. Keeps you sharp. Now is the time to innovate. Think. Be smart. Do more. Get more attention. Push more for the goals. People and companies will pull back, but being conservative, at least in my experience, isn't the way. I taught my 7-year-old to ski this winter and I've skied my whole life, nearly every day when I was a kid, and the thing I told him which I truly believe -- cautious people get hurt. I said to watch them on the hill from the chairlift. Then I told him to be aggressive. Attack the hill and be confident. He did and we ended up tackling black diamonds. He excelled.

Many times. For instance, in the Domodedovo Airport in Moscow, six or seven years ago. I just came back home from France where I travelled with the fabulous Alitalia (correspondence in Rome). I had no illusions about Alitalia but that time it exceeded all my expectations, delaying my luggage not only on my way to France but on my return flight as well. In Paris, I was nervous. I did not have much time in France so it was sad to lose six hours before my luggage finally reached CDG Airport. But this had happened before so I just sat in the airport and read a book, waiting for my things. In Moscow, I was absolutely tranquil. I had lots of time before me. And a good book. But other passengers were nervous (which was understandable) and started to get aggressive (which was not). Unhappy to lose their time, afraid to lose their luggage, they were full of spite - and they chose a young lady at the reception as the scapegoat, unleashing all their anger and frustration on her. The poor girl was very polite and tried to keep cool but one could see it was hard for her. I became angry myself. I advanced further and spoke in a very loud voice: Stop harassing the girl immediately! She did not lose your luggage! She is in no way responsible for your luggage being lost or delayed! Alitalia delayed your luggage! It happened in Rome, you understand? Not in Moscow! Nobody in this airport is to blame for this! Just have a little patience and behave humanly! I expected angry rebukes. But suddenly, the crowd was silent. They surrounded me as schoolkids would surround a teacher. Do you know what happened to our luggage? one of them asked pleadingly. My angry outburst somehow transformed me into a figure of authority. - I don’t know - I said. The girl said she does not know, either. But this is Alitalia, remember? They delayed my luggage on my way to Paris, they delayed it again on my way back. There is nothing we can do now. We can only wait and hope for the best. On my way to Paris, the luggage was delayed for six hours. The crisis was over. People thanked me and went in different directions. The young lady thanked me as well, tears in her eyes. It felt very agreeable, I must say. REMARK: It had nothing to do with the gender of the person. I’d do the same for a male."},{"instruction":"Where can I find packers and movers in Noida?","output":"Get in touch with ShiftingWale Packers and Movers Company in Noida, which makes your shifting easy and reliable at affordable prices.

People who already have knowledge about PHP and HTML would agree that no matter how many new languages and enhancements we learn; when it comes to web development, the two languages you need to immerse yourself in are PHP and HTML. I am sure those who are just diving into the deep sea of web development would find it difficult to digest, but learning PHP is actually quite simple. All you need is your text editor, the motivation to create web pages, and the ability to learn from your mistakes. As a student, you must take care of the first two requirements to learn PHP, but to help you in your learning process we have found the best online courses, tutorials and blog posts around PHP learning. So, without wasting any more time, let’s have a look at the 16 best websites for learning PHP programming. 1. Codecourse Formerly and more famously known as PHP Academy, [LINKED_TEXT: Code course ] [URL: https://www.codecourse.com/library]have gone beyond PHP and have included other web development and tools in their kitty, which might be the reason that prompted the change in name. However; regardless of the name, the PHP video tutorial by Codecourse are highly descriptive and contains details about each and every aspect of the language. If you are just starting with PHP, this might be the perfect match for you. Their videos are available on their official website and their YouTube channel. 2. Stone River eLearning Even though [LINKED_TEXT: Stone River eLearning] [URL: http://stoneriverelearning.com/courses] is not a PHP specific website, but their online courses cover almost every section of the language. The best part about Stone River eLearning is their lifetime access to courses that you purchase, as well as their 30 day no questions asked money back guarantee. Their delivery platform relies heavily on video-based lectures, and they provide direct email and forum support for all of their courses. 3. PHP Manual Arguably, the best of them all, the [LINKED_TEXT: PHP Manual] [URL: http://php.net/] has everything that you need in your quest to achieve glory in PHP. The best thing about PHP Manual is the section in every page that allows users to post their comments and experience with the function, and unlike the random comments that you will usually find under videos, these comments are extremely helpful in the practical applications of PHP. 4. Killer PHP The statement ‘Beginner PHP for Non Nerds’ is written in bold and capital at the homepage of this website and they surely abide by their words. Even though there is nothing killer about[LINKED_TEXT: Killer PHP] [URL: http://www.killerphp.com/], but it might just be the right assistant you need to get started with PHP. There blogs are very well written and explain the concepts in a very basic way which makes it easier for students from non technical backgrounds to grasp and learn. Word of advice, don’t go to Killer PHP with the expectations that it will transform you into a PHP guru. 5. PHP 101 [LINKED_TEXT: PHP 101] [URL: http://devzone.zend.com/6/php-101-php-for-the-absolute-beginner/] is another website that promises and delivers great content and learning with a pinch of entertainment for the absolute beginners. If you are just starting with PHP, PHP 101 might not be a bad start, however; you will need to move to websites that provide detailed content once you are past the beginner level. 6. Tutorials Point [LINKED_TEXT: Tutorials Point] [URL: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/] is not a PHP specific website but has an entire section dedicated to the language and thus has enough to make this list of the Top 20 websites for learning PHP. Their way of teaching and the short tabs for different concepts makes you believe that it is just another version of W3Schools, when actually it is an upgraded version with more content and more importantly, the right content. 7. Tizag Before I write about [LINKED_TEXT: Tizag] [URL: http://www.tizag.com/phpT/] and then the readers throw darts at me for it, I would mention it before hand that Tizag would not be my choice for a tutorial or a step by step guide, however; if you are looking for reference in PHP, this is not a bad option. Identical to W3Schools in its designs and display, Tizag is better because its content is more specific and is actually helpful. 8. SitePoint If you are one of those who prefer reading and learning instead of watching video tutorials, you might actually like site point for leaning PHP. However; I will not recommend you to start your journey in PHP with [LINKED_TEXT: site points] [URL: http://www.sitepoint.com/?s=php%20tutorials&type=post] as most of the content will be beyond your understanding and therefore finding the right content might prove a little frustrating. 9. Hacking with PHP Even though the name suggests that it will give you lessons on performing SQL injections and getting through the loop holes in PHP, but actually [LINKED_TEXT: Hacking with PHP] [URL: http://www.hackingwithphp.com/] is a pretty decent website for learning PHP and its content is to the point and specific. 10. Codeigniter If you are looking for a tool kit to assist you with your web application, [LINKED_TEXT: codeigniter] [URL: https://codeigniter.com/] could be the one you are looking for. Not essentially a PHP tutorial or learning website, but its powerful framework make codeigniter a good choice for those who have already crossed the beginners level and are itching to have more. 11. Lynda [LINKED_TEXT: Lynda.com] [URL: http://lynda.com/] is not actually a tutorial website or a website that has blogs on PHP, but Lynda is actually a website that provides platform for tutors and experts to publish their courses in their specific area of expertise and then students can make use of the knowledge and experience of the experts. Wait, this easy? Must be a catch? Yes, there is one. It is not a website that offers free courses and you will need to shell out a few bucks from your pocket to get the experts by your side. 12. Udemy Another one on similar lines, [LINKED_TEXT: Udemy] [URL: http://udemy.com/] also offers courses by experts on their area of expertise and students can purchase those courses and benefit from them. Again, it is not free, and if you are not willing to pay for learning PHP, this is probably not the option that you are looking for. 13. W3 Schools Okay, before I start, this probably will be the last website among all the ones listed here that I would want you to take up as your PHP learning guide, because, it is not a guide. Use it as a reference for verifying syntax, or small concepts but do not go beyond that. The only reason [LINKED_TEXT: W3Schools] [URL: http://www.w3schools.com/] has made this list is because of its exceptional SEO technique that makes it the first link on Google on any search that involves a web designing language. So, since you will end up at this website anyways, I thought I would just mention it here. 14. Derek Banas Video Tutorial on YouTube Before you guys go crazy about how a video that says “[LINKED_TEXT: Learn PHP in 30 minutes] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas]” could actually be good. It has to be crap. Well, I thought the same until one day I needed to brush up the little concepts of the language and it was at that time I realized that these videos are actually not that bad if you are in a hurry and just need a quick recap. Again, it is not a tutorial, not a guide, not a reference material, just a quick recap of what you have learned, so use it for that only. 15. StackOverflow And here it comes, my personal favourite, I call it the ‘Demi-God’, [LINKED_TEXT: StackOverflow] [URL: http://stackoverflow.com/] is, according to me, the best website for enthusiasts who are trying to learn new language and making errors and getting their hands dirty in the process. I do not remember a time when I tried searching something on this website and could not get an answer to my query. Experts, other beginners, people who have faced similar issues and the right answer, this website has it all. I would recommend it all the beginners. The best part is, it will only help if you actually work yourself. 16. Code Academy Even though [LINKED_TEXT: Code Academy] [URL: https://www.codecademy.com/] is again not a PHP specific website, but their tutorials cover almost every section of the language. The best part about Code Academy is their personalized tool that allows students to get their hands dirty and get practical understanding of the language. You might want to bear with the teaching style of the tutors which gets a little over the top at times."},{"instruction":"What are some dark secrets of Bipasha Basu & Karan Singh Grover?","output":"Iam not any Journalist or Personal Assistant for Bipasha and Karan to share dark secrets Sorry My answer is Too open Mind if it hurts Iam sorry"},{"instruction":"w realistic is a Thorium based nuclear reactor?","output":"It isn’t realistic at all.

Especially if they occure frequently."},{"instruction":"The Mahabhar","output":"Mahabharata in one of those two great epics in our mythology. There are lot's of warriors in Mahabharata who were undefeated like bhishma, drona, arjuna, karna, ashwatthama, abhimanyu etc. But according to the original Mahabharata karna was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. Some arjuna fans are always said that karna was beaten by arjuna, abhimanyu, satyaki, gandharvas then how he can be the most powerful. The reason is whenever karna lost by someone he lost by deceit. Arjuna always fought with gandiva only one time he not fought with gandiva in the rangabhoomi battle where karna overpower him. Abhimanyu beat karna with celestial raudra bow and brahma kavach. Gandharvas beat karna because he was alone, with ordinary bow, with affect of alchohal and a normal people knows that you can not fire celestial weapons with a ordinary bow. Arjuna defeat gandharvas by using gandiva and he was not alone bhima, nakula and sahadeva are also with him. In draupadi syamvar karna doesn't know that he was Arjuna he thought that he was a brahmin and karna doesn't want to fight with a brahmin because of his love towards them. Now coming to the point why karna was the powerful archer. Karna always fought with his fate. The son of the sun and princess kunti has never got what he born to have. Those who tell karna was teached by drona and drona not want to give him brahmastra he want to give him only Arjuna because he was loyal these all are fake things. We all know drona told to Arjuna that there will no one in this world equal to you in archery that's why he want eklavya s right thumb and karna was equal to Arjuna in archery and if he got brahmastra he and Arjuna are become same powerful that's why he not give him the knowledge of brahmastra. Now look some great feats of karna (1) stalmated with Arjuna in rangabhoomi battle. (2) parshuram tells that no khastriya in this world will equal to you. (3) posses weapons like brahmastra, Brahmashira, brahmadand, raudrastra, bhargavastra, nagastra etc. (4) possess Lord shiva s mighty celestial bow vijaya. (5) defeat all the kings in bhanumati syamvar. (6) the only warrior in Mahabharata who conquer the whole earth. (7) defeat the likes of bhaggdatta, shalya, rukmi, nagnajit in digvijay yatra. (8) defeat angas, bangas, kalingas. (8) defeat many powerful gods, yakshas, nagas, gandharvas, rakshasas of mahendra parvat and obtained many weapons from them. (9) he is invincible with his kavach and kundal. (10) supreme parmavatar Lord krishna tells that no one literally no one in this three worlds ( except brahma, vishnu, mahesh) have the capacity to defeat him. (11) The supreme nar-narayan also cannot defeat him. (12) greatest danveer of that era. (13) not conquer in battle by indra, yama, varuna, kubera and agni also. (14) defeat bhima, satyaki, dristadumyn, nakul, sahadeva multiple times. (15) killed 1.5 akshaunhi of pandava soldiers during his time of commander in chief. (16) bhishma tells he is the greatest warrior and he always saves pandavas from karna. (17) satyavadi yudhishthir tells that he can withstand immortals in battle. (18) killed 1000 of illusion of ghatotkach and killed him with vasavi shakti(now if he can destroy the illusion of ghatotkach so if he not drunk at the time of gandharva war he can destroy their illusion also). (19) possesor of bhargavastra the only weapon which Arjuna could not counter. (20) with his nagastra karna broke the invincible diadem of Arjuna which vajra also cannot broke. so karna was the powerful warrior of entire Mahabharata."},{"instruction":"Do you use your smartphone without any tempered glass or screen protector?","output":"Yes I do not use a screen protector.

Use alternate strategies to convince them. 2> Don’t make fun of us, especially at public gatherings. It may be a “little joke” for you, but we’ll remember it spitefully, well into our adulthood. 3> Let them be what they want to be in life. Don’t use them as instruments for fulfilling your goals and dreams. 4> Have the “sex talk”. Encourage them to have a healthy sex life and make sure they know about best possible options. 5> Don’t judge them! I’m sure you’ve done tonnes of mistakes too growing up too. 6> Their sexuality is NONE of your business. Let them do what they want. 7> Don’t raise them as investments for your old age, you shouldn’t have to depend on them forever. Let us go and live our own life! 8> Let them watch porn. And stop shaming them and acting like you never did! 9> Respect needs to be earned. We’re not gonna respect you just because you are elder to us (I call B.S. on that argument). 10> If your teenage son / daughter calls out your mistakes, don’t get angry. They’re not as stupid as you think. 11> Don’t you dare hit them, you think you’ve disciplined them but in reality they’re gonna hate and loathe you even more. Plus you could be jailed. 12> Trust them. Stop asking them questions 24*7. They have their own life and you aren’t in charge. 13> Your experience doesn’t count. Times have changed, teenagers are more intelligent, pragmatic and awesome. The “when I was your age…” argument will no longer work. Get over it! Also, you guys aren’t that well informed as you think you are. Face the facts, however harsh they might sound. 14> Honesty is NOT the best policy always. We understand that. You should start getting used to that fact as well, dear adults. 15> Don’t pretend you’re perfect. You’re not, we know it. So, stop being pretentious and cherish the experience of living life imperfectly. 16> Swearing doesn’t make us a bad person. Everyone does it. You do it too! 17> Don’t force your opinions on us. We may not be religious. We may change religions. We may marry someone White / Latino / Black / Asian etc. We may wear tank tops and bikinis. Our wish, you don’t get a say. 18> Be supportive when they run into problems. Your life wasn’t perfect as well. 19> Give us our space. We don’t need you 24*7 and if that makes you feel bad, sorry. 20> Emotional blackmail. Seriously, stop it. I’ve seen many adults f*ck up their children’s life choices (career / personal life / college etc.) through this. Treat us as your friend, and you’ll have gone a long way in raising us well.

It’s way past time we talked about some of them. Here’s a list of some favorites for me in no particular order:**Note, I’ve put the picture for each under its description. The Prince of Egypt (Dreamworks) Whether you are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or none of the above, this beautifully animated 2D masterpiece features wonderful story telling as well as amazing music that will move audiences of all backgrounds. I love how much they researched the ancient culture to bring it to life, as well as how round and human the characters feel. Particularly, the depiction of the Pharaoh Ramses (his brother) is heart-wrenching. You can’t help feeling bad for him—and yet you know that Ramses is his own greatest enemy as well. That’s great story writing. (And, did I mention the music? The music!) The Road to El Dorado (Dreamworks) Another great animated masterpiece with amazing music. Though it gets some criticism by some for featuring slightly more adult content, it’s still veiled from young audiences and is filled with humor, as well as a tip of the hat to the original “Road to” Bing and Bob movie series it’s based off of. The music is created by major composer Tim Rice and sung by Elton John. Despite some in the United States saying they feel that some of the cultural depictions are offensively inaccurate, many in South America (you know, the culture being depicted) defend it. In fact, it was extremely popular in South America. It was scheduled for a sequel, but it was cancelled (which, given the quality of 2D animated sequels, it was probably for the best). Anastasia (Fox — Directed by Don Bluth) True, this movie was purchased by Disney along with Fox, but it was NOT created by Disney’s studios or Pixar and is NOT a Disney movie. (Owning the rights to something doesn’t make you the artist, after all). Great music, great animation—huge hit in its time. It is based on real characters (like Anastasia, Rasputin, Nicholas II, etc) but is HIGHLY fictionalized (obviously—since the real Anastasia was murdered in cold blood along with the rest of her family by the Russian socialist party). But, this gives a happier, magical “what if” that makes it all the more sad if you realize the history (and the rumor) which inspired its creation. The Land Before Time (Universal Picture — Don Bluth) Bring out your tissues for this tear-jerker from the 80s. Though the dinosaur depictions are a little dated (and the names are obviously made up to make it easier for kids—though that part was actually pretty creative), this story is actually a drama with a lot of charm. Note—this only applies to the first one which was created by Bluth. Not the… ehem… THIRTEEN horrible cash-grab spin offs directed by various other people. The Iron Giant (Warner Brothers) This one, surprisingly, was not very popular when it first came out—likely because of the mild swearing and slight adult themes which probably caught parents off guard (especially those with younger children). But it became increasingly popular in the years afterwards and for many is the movie that defined their childhood. It is humorous, but also a drama (dealing with concepts of life and death) with a bitter-sweet ending to tie it all together. All Dogs go to Heaven (Bluth Studios) Set in 1939 New Orleans, this movie has a fun yet surreal setting with catchy music that will play on repeat in your brain. However, this is another film that perhaps wasn’t received as well as Bluth expected at the box office (again, because of some mild darker or adult themes), but which grew in popularity outside the theaters. The film even had to be edited in production to remove the Gatling gun (which became a laser gun) and blood (which became smashed tomatoes and produce in the film) to make it more kid-friendly. But the story of a former dog-criminal turned good (well… okay. Good-ish) to help an innocent, 7-year-old little girl is pretty fun and heartwarming. Spirited Away (Ghibli Studios) This comes from the Japanese studio often compared to Disney—but with an entirely different vibe, style… and everything really. It’s kind of unfair to compare it to Disney, except to say that Miyazaki, like Walter E. Disney, is extremely passionate and particular about his work. Spirited Away is one of his big ones. In fact, I wish I could include (almost) all of Miyazaki’s films, but I fought hard to narrow down to just the two on the list. Spirited Away features many images of Japanese folklore and themes of nature, mankind, and coming of age. The music is outstanding, and the world is perfectly written so that it feels mystic and mysterious without over-explaining it. Howl’s Moving Castle (Ghibli Studios) This is the second Ghibli movie on this list. As usual, it’s about exploring unfamiliar worlds filled with breathtaking imagery, beautiful music, and warm characters that charm their way into your heart. Like many Miyazaki films, the world feels very deep and round with interesting events going on in the background that have little to do with the characters’ and their actions, but rather more serve to further develop their world instead. It’s like the protagonists are all in a living world, and their goal isn’t to save the world, just to exist and survive in it. Klaus (Netflix Animation) A charming movie from Netflix about the retold origin story for “Santa Claus” (or “Sante Klaus”). It has the vibe of Disney’s Emperor’s New Groove, but with a fun Christmas flare as Jesper (the young, spoiled protagonist) is given a nearly impossible task in order to prevent himself from getting financially cut off by his father—leading him to seek the help of a reclusive woodsman, Klaus. This unique movie is hand-drawn but its coloring techniques (using digital lighting) gives it a very unique, 2D-CG appearance. It’s won a couple awards and is well worth a watch. Arthur Christmas (Aardman Studios) While it’s not Pixar-quality, this CG animated film is charming in its own way. This is a British-animated Christmas movie about Santa Claus’s second son, Arthur, who can best be described as adorably clumsy and awkward. This is a fun, light-hearted, and feel-good Christmas movie with a lot of heart that has charmed audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Yeah, some parts of the plot are obviously a little silly (like when the countries all team up to try and save Christmas from what they believe to be …a UFO…), but it’s made for younger audiences. That being said, the animation is okay, and both the characters and conflict are impressively developed for a small-kid’s show. Kung Fu Panda Series (DreamWorks) DreamWorks and Jack Black combine to create a story about a fanboy Panda (adopted by a goose) who literally stumbles into the role of Dragon Warrior. What follows is hijinks and awkwardness, but it’s the lovably weird awkwardness we’ve come to expect from DreamWorks’ CG movies. Yeah, it has perhaps one too many fart jokes for me, but the movie is pretty well-made overall, and it’s animated very nicely. I was a little disappointed by the plot of the 3rd movie (despite being very well animated and having a lot of promise), but the Kung Fu Panda movie series has done pretty well for itself. Rise of the Guardians (DreamWorks) This movie is somewhat underrated (though, to be fair, it has its own huge occult following, particularly with pre-teen girls who adore Jack). The backstory of the protagonist is heart-warming, and even though he is somewhat of an outcast character, he’s not the typical underdog. In fact, he is quite powerful and even starts out as a more-or-less neutral force between the villain and the heroes. His primary weakness isn’t a physical one, but rather a psychological one which temps him and causes the conflict. The animation, at times, can be a little… eerie, but for the most part is well done for the time period. Plus, it features perhaps one of the best depictions of Santa Claus I have ever seen. Ever. I LOVE the tough but kind Russian Santa! Lupin the Third: The First (TMS Entertainment) I haven’t actually seen this one, but there is a lot of growing hype for it online. This is a Japanese CG animated film based off the Lupin III series, which is usually 2D animated and (depending on the adaptation) can be anything between a light-hearted, mild PG13 film to a “DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS EVER” R-rated film—depending on the director and adaptation. Needless to say, this series has been adapted A LOT, since Lupin III is a majorly popular character in Japan. This newest featured animation seems to display some Disney-esque animation, particularly in characters like Laetitia (if I spelled that right…) who looks like she would fit perfectly into the background of the Frozen movies. The film has already been nominated for 2 awards. The age rating hasn’t been released, but despite the Disney-faced girl, I’m going to say a comfortable PG13 based on the gun-slinging trailer. It will be available in selective theaters in the USA. Over the Moon (Pearl Studio + Sony Pictures + Netflix Animation) This movie surprised me and I found myself far more interested in this than in Disney’s announcement of “Raya and the Last Dragon” (which looks more like The Legend of Korra meets Big Hero 6, if you want to be honest). But this story feels more fresh, like it’s not trying to prove a point other than to immerse the audience in the love of lore and environment. The music is also pretty decent. Most of the songs are good, one is really good, and one… is kind of awkward—but forgivable. Though some parts of the plot are a little predictable, there is somewhat of a twist at the end, and a lot of heart.

There was no break with older thought, and the constitutive “stuff” of Christianity was itself Hellenistic stuff. If anything, the Christian movement manifested properties latent, often already emerging, within the Roman world. From the outset I wish to offer a disclaimer: here all I’m talking about is the mythic Jesus, not Jesus the man. Let your author draw a veil over his beliefs on the events of AD 1–33 Galilee, and think of the texts and thoughts of Christians (and others). I do want to talk about my views on morality and religion, though. Where the things most of us call “good” and “evil” are concerned, I think the psychological matter is best explained in terms of gender politics - not trying to give anyone the final word, but as a practical or working hypothesis. The ‘root of evil’ - I’ll here define evil as all the unpleasant, ultimately self-destructive activities that go beyond hunting, natural violence and survival, the kind of activity that creates a self-perpetuating ‘system’ of suffering - is the relationship of domination, the belief that it is good to affect without being affected, and that this basic impulse is fundamentally expressed through a perversion of sexuality that is generally seen as masculine, or even the basis of masculinity. I would like to tie this to the (popular understanding of) the Kantian “do not treat others as means”, and as the lowest or even logical conclusion of Buber’s Ich-Es (I & It) kind of relation. In other words, generic evil appears when sexuality is cloven apart from emotions. We - to a very large degree - relate to the world through our sexuality. The perpetuation of evil stems from the internal assumption of a ‘mounting’ persona or relationship of control (to people, countries, or ourselves) that blocks the natural, benevolent emotions that could underwrite sexuality. War, tyranny and their fellows are the breakthrough of this emotional alienation of man from his environment. Next, religion and its shifts. Think of the human psyche as a river or reservoir; the collective “bank” from which our potential thick-rich knowledge of the world is drawn. Left alone, it is withdrawn and latent. We turn our backs to it and observe the world of phenomena, of things and facts - the realm of Ich-Es relations. The world of religious symbols, inclusively conceived, is the system of irrigation by which water from the reservoir flows to illuminate the world of phenomena. Our ability to see through the phenomena - to integrate the diverse particulars into universal, relatable categories, and ultimately to understand being, stems from this irrigation. The “water” in our analogy is imaginative and libidinous, but its movement is not constant. The river shifts, ebbs, and bursts its banks as it moves forward, and the irrigation channels are left dry. The healthy life of a generation depends on having the mythological irrigation channels at an even or nearly even level with its floodwaters, so it continues to see its inner, psychological life manifest in the world of phenomena. To borrow Engels out of context, that its productive abilities keep pace with its means of production. When this link is broken, the channels run dry and the phenomenal, outer world seems to run out of control. When this happens, as with the apparatus of pagan religion in late Hellenistic times, the theatric plays that used to give life become meaningless. Some people try to adapt them, as the philosophers interpreted the old gods into universal categories, and popularized the mysteries to keep people in touch. The water eventually bursts its banks, breaking through the psychological fields to form new spiritual avenues and divinities. And once again, so long as the imaginative and intellective faculties of humanity keep fact wedded with fiction, all is well with the world - until we let the waters run away from us and the process must repeat all over again. I am intent on looking at Jesus as an intensely feminine figure, part of the wider spectrum of oriental mystery religions that swept through Rome in the early centuries AD. By ‘oriental’ I here mean of supposed Asiatic origin, although they were in fact thoroughly Hellenized in content under a veil of exoticism. These cults all centred on the figure of the dying-and-resurrected god, of whom Jesus is himself an example, and often had major goddess-figures, as Mary and Sophia were for Christianity. These included the worship of Osiris & Isis, of Attis & Cybele, and the Parthian Mithras. And apart from Mithras - who was, unlike the others, a soldier’s god from the first, taken from the only enemy Rome felt her equal - these gods all had a dubious masculinity. Osiris is dismembered, then his parts gathered together and resurrected by his sister/wife Isis - except for his penis, which is replaced with a wooden replica to sire Horus. More than that, Osiris is a defeated god, a ‘loser’ - as in the Christianate [LINKED_TEXT: Kosovo Myth] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Myth], a king gives up his earthly kingdom to win the kingdom everlasting. Osiris is Lord of Eternity, but became so by a passive act, an out and out defeat. Attis was explicitly a eunuch. His origins are even more effeminate: the hermaphroditic demon Agdistis, a primordial male-and-female entity, was feared by the gods: so they sheared off his male genitals, turning him into the goddess Cybele, the Magna Mater (Great Mother) of the Phrygians. These genitals are then incubated by a mortal woman, who gives birth to Attis, a beautiful man whom Cybele falls in love with. On seeing Cybele, Attis is overcome by the divine glory and castrates himself - after dying, he is reborn as her divine consort. All Cybele’s priests were castrated on his account (a custom banned by the Romans, who viewed effeminacy as degenerate). I would like to touch upon one of the most primitive facets of human religion, meaning the androgyny that often goes hand-in-hand with shamanism. Among shamanic peoples, the practice is closely associated with crossing gender boundaries - the (male) shaman acting as a woman, or simply transvestite. The custom has passed down to the hijri (man-woman, ‘transgender’) of India, closely associated with the Sufi orders carrying the traditions of old Turkic shamanism. To go to the early roots of Greek paganism, we find this tradition embodied in Tiresias, the blind prophet of Apollo who one might say represents the memory of this practice in Greek religion. By separating two mating serpents with his walking-stick, Tiresias is turned into a woman - and spends seven years bearing children and working as a famous prostitute. On meeting the two serpents again, he does not interfere - and becomes a man again. Later on, he is asked to resolve a dispute between Zeus and Hera on which gender enjoys sex more (both gods wanting him to say their respective gender enjoys it less) - on replying that “of the ten parts of sexual pleasure, men have only one” he is struck blind by Hera, and given the “second sight” (prophecy) by Zeus. I don’t think I need to elaborate on this: effeminacy, & surrender of this world for the other. Another example of this figure was Odin - who sacrificed “himself to himself” on the world tree, and gave up one eye, for the secrets of the runes and prophecy. And he, too, was regarded as bridging gender boundaries - the seiðr or sorcery he brought humanity was regarded as a woman’s art. The songs I know/ that kings' wives know not/ Nor men that are sons of men. (Hávamál) By all this I mean to get at a process that went on in both Roman and Hebrew worlds. The story of Christ was not new, but it was one that worked. The Hebrew God was intensely masculine, and his people shook the Roman order in the East. The reason the Christians were persecuted was because they refused to sacrifice to the deified Emperor, but it was not their idea; the Hebrews had been doing the same for centuries, and the first Jew to sacrifice to the Roman gods was, tellingly, killed for it. The Roman East was periodically rocked by the revolts of the bearded, monotheist orientals, who (then) were spread from Cyprus to Egypt, and - as was common in the urban centres of the East - expressed their rejection of the Hellenistic world by massacring Greeks. The Romans more or less wiped out the Jews from the Holy Land (and Justinian the Samaritans, centuries later). Dominating psychic archetypes contain their own opposites; Jesus (and I repeat, this is the mythic Jesus we’re talking about) represented a deconstruction of the old ways, an inverted Messiah. Consider the Gospel of Matthew - by an author who saw himself as a pious, orthodox Jew - which most firmly indicts Israel for his murder. [Pilate] took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. (Matthew 27:24–25) Quoth Nietzsche, or Zarathustra - “God is dead… we have killed him. What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent?… There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us---for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.” Nothing is new under the sun. But the Christian mythos represented the greatest tribal betrayal towards Israel. Matthew is saying, “forget the Romans, the external enemy - forget the kingship of David. Look within yourselves, for you have blood on your hands.” I’ll get to this feeling of guilt, but this idea allowed the Christian sect to become universal and cosmopolitan, despite growing out of the most insular of tribes. Guilt, effeminacy, and defeat - the surrender of this earthly kingdom - were the wings on which Christianity rose. Nietzsche and other “new Europe” thinkers hated it for that, as did the official Roman ideology. But this guilt was very important, because it opened a new - sufficiently new, at least - avenue to “the race of men” (as the ancient Greeks used to distinguish us from “the race of women”). There are many things wrong with any society, and especially many situations in which ancient society pushed men specifically into psychological dead ends. The pagan nobility - and the nobility were generally the most strongly attached to pagan heritage - were warriors par excellence. Many people, especially the poor, had nothing to gain from a society of wolves. Christianity sanctioned criticism of the clan, or the empire, or the Emperor; it allowed people to see the blood on their hands, to openly say that “something is rotten in the state of Denmark.” Most importantly, it let any man psychologically transpose himself onto Jesus, a feminine figure, and act in ways repugnant and dishonourable to the old ways. Martyrdom (i.e. meekly submitting to execution) and self-surrender were the most visible manifestations of an opening of the civilized Roman man to a new way of interacting with the world. The transvestite shaman breaks social and spiritual boundaries, acting as a medium between society and the spirit world. The universal sacrifice, the god who dies and is resurrected, acted as the medium to allow men the greatest collective shamanic act. [At the time of the Crucifixion] Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull (Golgotha), they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!” But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:32–33, 39–43) An act that is infantilizing, and repugnant to the public morality, i.e. the morality of men. “And he said: ‘Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 18:3) Since when I was little and had the story told to me, I have thought of St. Dionysius of Zante (1547–1622) here in Greece as extraordinary; from my answer to ‘who is your favourite saint’ some years ago: He was born to the prominent Sigouros family in the Ionian island of Zante off the western coast of Greece, under the Frankish (Venezian) rule. He was prepared from a young age to enter the priesthood, his family’s station gaining him the headship of a monastery two years after entering it, leaving his own properties to his brother […] one of the men of the rival Mondine family, which was engaged in a feud with Dionysius’ own, killed his brother and, not knowing the head of the local monastery was the brother of the man he had killed, sought asylum there. Instead of killing the man as honour would have demanded (or, in the style of the Inquisition, turning him over to the secular authorities) he hid him and helped him escape; leading the killer to eventually become a monk himself. Vendettas and honour killings for even less palatable reasons were the rule at the time; and their worst centres were the “unchurched” high places where paganism was strong. Christianity - not as a break with Romanity, or an external entity, but as a focus for the energies of the Greek world - represented an alternative. As, over the middle ages, Christianity spread over the barbarian lands of Western Europe, it had a similar effect. This was, again, not a break with their own past: conversion itself was one point in long histories of reform and social evolution, spaced centuries apart. But as increasingly literate societies, centred in the churches, sought to fix their systemic problems, it was the Christian man - the “unmanly man” they turned to. In many ways, this massively increased the efficiency of centralized violence - the kingship itself becoming more able to organize the new society. But when, for example, the Normans and their successors imposed a more regularised Christianity on the land, they ended slavery and concubinage - both manifestations of man’s desire to be a little king in his own house. Christianity spoke of people as a shepherd’s flock, not wolves, and against the individual’s right to act as a warrior, to kill “if need be”. Christ, as the effeminate Son, became a new way for men to relate to their inner Father - the Despot, the “master of the house.”"},{"instruction":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","output":"The natural gas supply is very reliable. Other than in places with earthquakes, or in a situation where a very large gas explosion affects supplies, it tends to keep supplying end users. The main reason is that even if the gas utility does not add gas into the supply system, the pressure in major gas supply lines is high enough that the supply line itself contains a significant quantity of gas and can maintain enough pressure to supply end users for a long time - several days. There are several reasons why gas distribution pressure is much higher than end-user supply pressure (for most end users) and this reliability is one of them. Another reason is to stop the retail end users messing with the gas supply to defraud the supplier. Additionally, transport and compression facilities in gas networks are typically powered from the gas itself (most gas compressors are powered by gas turbines derived from aviation technology, which burn some gas to compress the rest) and their control equipment is built to run independently of the electrical grid if required. Because electricity is generated from gas, it is important that gas networks do not need the electricity grid to operate or the electricity grid could never self-start. Gas supplies are always underground, which protects them from most natural forces (except earthquakes and extreme erosive events). You have to protect the lines delivering to your equipment, but that is within your control. You can build a reinforced blockhouse around your supply entry point, or otherwise protect the gas lines as they run around your site. Therefore, operating an electrical generator from the gas supply is a reasonable decision in most circumstances. If you have a strong need for redundancy, on-site compressed gas tanks with automatic supply switching could be used. One of the most frequent problems with diesel-powered site electricity generators in longer power outages is refuelling them. Getting fuel deliveries when transport infrastructure is disrupted and many consumers want to get fuel can be difficult. A contractor may not be able to get to the site, or may just not fulfil the contract. There is little you can do in that sort of scenario.

Like you said, Eobard was the reason Barry Allen became the Flash. If we are talking about the CW series, it gets a bit confusing. There was an original timeline.

The part that stands out is that Barry’s parents were alive during this. And then to continue this explanation, i’d have to tell you all about how Barry traveled centuries into the future. When he arrived, he met another version of the Flash. This future flash revealed himself as Eobard Thawne. Thawne was obsessed with the Flash.

Dravidians, like others, are a highly mixed population that, genetically, represents a transition zone right at the boundary between West Eurasia and East Eurasia. Thus, they have a lot of ancestry and, therefore, phenotypic influence from broadly Caucasoid-looking (originally from West Asia and South-Central Asia) and broadly Australoid-looking populations (from South Asia itself, probably once extending as far as parts of Southeast Asia, too). They themselves show very variable relative proportions of each of them, irrespective of skin color. Some Dravidian-speaking groups, like the Iyers, are very much shifted toward the usually Caucasoid-looking West Eurasians, while others, like the tribal adivasi Pulliyar and Paniya peoples, are very much shifted toward the generically Australoid-like indigenous South Asian cluster. That means that some Dravidian speakers are probably a bit closer to a Persian-speaking Iranian or a Pashto-speaking Pashto than to a fellow Dravidian speaker from an adivasi Scheduled Tribe. This diversity of genetic makeup, but usually within the same pattern of some degree of mixing between West Eurasians and autochthonous South/Southeast Asians (who were originally broadly Australoid peoples in terms of phenotype), extends to the varied looks of Dravidian peoples. ABOVE: PCA chart plotting some South Asian, West Eurasian and Southeast Asian average population samples from the HarappaWorld database. The distances between populations show their relative degree of genetic similarity. The Dravidians are thus unfit for all those wide-ranging and, consequently, necessarily unspecific categories that represent the extremes of each category better than those at their margins. Said categories are actually about physical phenotypes, not races in a precisely biological sense, and only indirectly, by extension, correlates with genetic origins, which can be much more varied, mixed, intricately interwoven than physical phenotypes. Granted, we can all see that some kinds of looks and facial features are more common (though not universal, far less exclusive) in one region’s population than in others’, but that’s still, inevitably, a very broad generalization and arbitrary definiton based entirely on people’s perceptions (therefore, inherently involving some subjectivity) on some specific potions of the looks of others (e.g. skull type, nose width and length, mouth shape and lips, whatever, the choices of main criteria to enact the classification will always be somewhat arbitrary)."},{"instruction":"w did flour mills work in the olden days?","output":"Ok, so flour mills fell into four categories: man, animal, water, and wind powered.

Of all of the powering options, this one is the hardest to pull off. You have to build a leat (an offshoot of the River or stream), that fills a mill pond, that would then in kind supply the mill with constant water at a constant speed. Trust me for the time it was complicated and considered cutting edge.Wind. Is your land flat? Do you have winds constantly? Then wind is for you!

Alex was a fitness enthusiast, a health-conscious individual who spent hours in the gym, followed a balanced diet, and did everything he could to maintain his wellness. Yet, despite his efforts, he often found himself feeling weak and fatigued. Perplexed and concerned, Alex decided to consult a GP. After a series of tests, the doctor revealed that Alex's hemoglobin levels were lower than normal. Just an important reminder: hemoglobin is a protein in our red blood cells that carries oxygen from our lungs to the rest of our body. It's like a fleet of trucks transporting vital supplies to various parts of a city. When the number of trucks (hemoglobin) is low, the supply (oxygen) doesn't reach all parts of the city (body), causing the city to function less efficiently. In Alex's case, his body wasn't getting enough oxygen, causing him to feel weak and tired. That's why I regularly check my hemoglobin level. Because it's not enough to just eat well and exercise. So, if you're someone who is doing everything right but still feeling weak, it might be time to check your hemoglobin levels. Actually, you may take a quiz to check your personal risk of having low hemoglobin. It's simple, but it can help to understand in time whether it is worth going to take tests or there is no risk. I used this one: [LINKED_TEXT: Anemia Risk Score QuizPlease note that these questions are intended as a screening tool only and should not replace a thorough medical evaluation by a healthcare professionalhttps://tally.so/r/w54Wpb?src=quora] [URL: https://tally.so/r/w54Wpb?src=quora]"},{"instruction":"What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)?

There is a credible story and corresponding information proving that the Chinese did reach India and the Eastern coast of Africa, before the emperors decided that there was nothing of interest outside of China. This includes a stone engraved with four languages and found in Sri Lanka, an African mosque which incorporated in its decoration a Ming porcelain , the shape of some fishing nets… As for a pre-columbian discovery of America by the Chinese, the evidence produced by the book is extremely hazy. One can claim that some contemporary decorative motivs show Chinese influence and some ancient buildings were inspired by Chinese styles. Since the purported Chinese exploration expedition is supposed to have taken place after Marco Polo’s trip, some of the objects could have landed on the American continent as a consequence stuff carried by some Spaniards in particular the Chinese coin… I can only imagine two reasons for the writing of this book and its relative publishing success.

Sometimes if you mess with the knobs you can hear problems as the algorithm has to readjust In the past, delay was accomplished by using tape, delayed playback but today it is too expensive even though that does not matter to everyone. Look up the Roland space Echo Reverb is like delay but millions of echoes close enough in time to sound like a blur. And digital units it's only thousands or even dozens of echoes but that's fine In most guitar amps reverb is accomplished by feeding the sound into springs that sympathetically resonate and create millions of Reflections in a tiny metal box. Pretty cool Both can occur in nature, but at the same time. In some situations you can notice delay and in some situations you can notice reverb, depends on the space but in the physics sence both are always happening unless if you are in an anechoic chamber The psychoacoustic line in the middle between Reverb and Delay has to do with the HAAS effect.

While it's important to prioritize your health and well-being, there are several steps you can take to accelerate your weight loss journey. Here are some expert tips to help you shed those extra pounds effectively: 1. Set Realistic Goals Before embarking on any weight loss journey, it's crucial to set realistic and achievable goals. Rapid weight loss may not be sustainable in the long run and can have adverse health effects. Aim for a gradual and steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week for safe and lasting results. 2. Focus on Nutrition Eating a balanced and nutrient-rich diet is paramount to quick and healthy weight loss. Opt for whole foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Cut back on processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie beverages. Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. 3. Stay Hydrated Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day not only supports overall health but also aids in weight loss. Water helps control appetite, boosts metabolism, and can prevent overeating. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. 4. Incorporate Physical Activity Engaging in regular physical activity is essential for burning calories and accelerating weight loss. Aim for a combination of cardiovascular exercises (such as walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training (using weights or resistance bands) to build muscle and boost metabolism. 5. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Consider incorporating HIIT workouts into your fitness routine. HIIT involves alternating between high-intensity exercises and short rest periods. This approach is effective in burning calories, increasing metabolic rate, and improving cardiovascular fitness. 6. Get Adequate Sleep Prioritize quality sleep, as inadequate sleep can hinder weight loss efforts. Poor sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite, leading to increased cravings and overeating. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. 7. Manage Stress Chronic stress can contribute to weight gain and hinder weight loss progress. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. 8. Monitor Your Progress Keep track of your food intake, physical activity, and progress. Journaling can help you stay accountable and identify areas for improvement. Regularly reviewing your efforts can also boost motivation and keep you on track. 9. Seek Professional Guidance Consulting with a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs and goals. They can help create a customized meal plan, recommend appropriate exercises, and monitor your progress. 10. Avoid Extreme Measures While the goal is to lose weight quickly, it's essential to avoid extreme measures such as crash diets or excessive calorie restriction. These approaches can lead to nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss, and other health issues. 11. Stay Consistent Consistency is key when it comes to weight loss. Stay committed to your healthy eating and exercise routine, even on days when motivation is low. Remember that sustainable results take time and effort. 12. Stay Patient and Positive Weight loss is a journey that requires patience and a positive mindset. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small, and focus on the overall progress you're making toward a healthier lifestyle. In conclusion, losing weight quickly and safely involves making smart choices about nutrition, exercise, and overall well-being. By setting realistic goals, adopting healthy habits, and staying consistent, you can achieve your weight loss objectives while prioritizing your health.

Right?"},{"instruction":"it true that something big is going to happen between India and China at Ladakh?","output":"Thanks for the loaded question. Those who understand how geopolitical views works against ‘incidents’ will understand this differently. Lets us look at how this stands on the India- China conflict. The first war fought in 1962 was not brazen and harsh nor was it- hegemony. It was just a border skirmish, at best. Unfortunately at the time, India did not have a fully organised fighting force. China had progressed in the meantime- yet they did not go to full-scale war. It remained a fight in the alleyways. No side won or lost- but trumpets were sounding from both sides. What it did do was remind India that war is perpetual preparation. India learned a lesson and China leaned a bigger one. At that time the Russians were flexing muscle and the Indians fell for muscle with no bone or protein-fed growth. It did remind other world powers that the sides were newly balanced. That is a geopolitical new. Let's jump forward to 1972. There was another skirmish. India seemed to win- but not really. It was a peacock at the show. Meanwhile, the Pakistans flexed their muscles and got their asses kicked. For the next 40 years, it took them time to lick their bleeding wounds. They still puff up their chest but a pin-prick might just deflate them for good. Let's move on. China and India are re-setting the geopolitical view of the new globe. Thanks to the wonderful and cunning coronavirus. Everybody is blaming China for the pandemic but is it China? Think again. Ok, You’ve heard all the conspiracy theories but have you sat down and analysed why this is so? Well, well, little children it is not China or Santa Claus. It just happened naturally. Unfortunately, when the entire globe is resetting its priorities on an economic, political, rational and geopolitical front somebody has to blame somebody else. I know who is making the most accusations. All it will take is read every scrap of a news article written from a thousand angles and you will know who is right and who is wrong? Nobody is right or nobody is wrong. Back to the India-China, once again, it's the news articles. Every newspaper has to sell every day and so you get a masala puri with all sorts of stuff in it. Much of the leaking news can not be confirmed or denied. Is this one more article? New world politics means you have to pick your nose clean. All the propaganda, all the shouting and screaming, and all the innuendos are really hot air. Everyone has an opinion ( including me). Most of it is hollow. Most of the wonderful articles need readers. China needs to hustle on the world stage and it needs to raise its voice. Therefore throw some bullets across the border and you will have a raging bonfire in India. Thanks to those silly newspapers. ( Oops one more newspaper sold!) What does India do? Send out an arm wrestler and flex some colourful headdress. It means nothing. Noise is easy to generate. What happens?- the newspapers declare war for the sake of their readers. Happens all the time. Now countries take sides. The wonderful USA shouts for attention, the UK slinks into a corner, France jumps up and Down, Pakistan growls a low economic growl, China sits back and laughs and India sits back and laughs. Towards the evening they go to tea laughing. One wise minister asks. What's all this fuss about? : We are the best of friends. Cut the crap out. Those who don't want to do business with China can come to us. And China says: Go to India; Shall we share the profits? That evening they sit down to green tea and samosas. China and India are the best of friends. Does anyone notice? Both don't need war- they need business. In another twenty years, Both China and India will win the race- neck to neck (Photo finish). How could they do this with fighting against each other? They run alongside- both laughing at these dumbass Western Nations” Nope, they are the best of friends?

Which one is the most versatile? Which one is best for pros and which is for beginners? After reading hundreds of reviews and trying out different software, I will try to dissect the top 5 photo editing software in India and explain why they are best for you! 1. Adobe Photoshop CC: Photoshop is the go-to software for every professional photographer. It’s also a part of [LINKED_TEXT: Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite] [URL: https://www.dolphincomputer.co.in/product/adobe-creative-cloud-for-teams/]. Photoshop CC comes with a learning curve as the interface is difficult to get around, but you can learn the basics with some patience in no time. In addition to photos, you can create and edit illustrations, paintings, and 3D artworks. Key features include retouching, stroke smoothing, new brush features, masking, and HEIF. These features are associated with Photoshop as it does them the best. 2. Adobe Lightroom CC: Adobes products are considered as a Gold standard when talking about image editing software. Adobe Lightroom CC is one of the great tools due to why Adobe is famous. Lightroom is a cloud-based image editor and a part of Adobe Software Suite. This is the go-to software for people looking to touch up their photos quickly, and it’s available on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS devices.Adobe offers a user-friendly interface with Lightroom that anyone can get used to.You can find your image library on the left side, and on the right side, you find drop down menus for quick adjustments.This software is best suited for light editing alone. You don’t need an extra photo organizing program as Lightroom can store and organize your images.You can only edit what you capture. This means you can only tweak the images of existing qualities and features. 3. Corel Paintshop Pro: In contrast to Photoshop, Paintshop Pro is far easy to learn by beginners. It’s one of the straightforward photo editing software in the market. It’s loved by beginners and offers versatile features to professionals as well. In a nutshell, you get photoshop features but at a budget-friendly price. Paintshop Pro supports multiple layer editing. You can edit vector images and raster as well. Some missing features are detailed typography, 3D modeling, face liquefy, and automatic subject selection, found in photoshop. Considering the lower price, we can let it slide. 4. Affinity Photo: Affinity Photo is another direct competitor to Adobe Photoshop. Affinity Photo is a vector graphic design application with a combination of pixel art environments and vectors. In contrast to Photoshop, Affinity has a one-time low payment. This is another budget-friendly photo editing software that packs a punch. It has a lot of similar features to Photoshop. It does come with a learning curve, but you’ll start creating masterpieces once you get the hang of it. Affinity works on both Windows and Mac. The key features include batch processing, RAW editing, 360-degree photo editing, cloning, healing, retouching, focus stacking, digital painting, and advanced retouching tools. 5. Skylum Luminar 4: Luminar packs hundreds of built-in tools and preset effects neatly organized into categories. This is a must-have tool for photographers on a budget. Its popularity is growing at a fast speed. You have the power to create your presents by combining the built-in filters, and Luminar has a custom workspace option as well. It is a hybrid of photo editing software and an image organizer. It’s the perfect pick for mid-range photo editing. The key features include an AI editor, dedicated presets, adjustment layers, exclusive filters, and image layers.

Here’s the sanitized version: I had taken a coworker to get his car out of the shop; he’d had a variety of performance “toys” added. We lived and worked in the desert southwest. The trip from shop to where we lived was about two hundred miles one way, and to add insult to injury, this was during the national 55 MPH speed limit mandate. We had walkie-talkies borrowed from work (before cell phone days), so we could communicate. Some miles after getting out of town we began to play. We ended up at 110 MPH with me in his draft; I was about two inches off his rear bumper… at 110 MPH. We were spotted by an areal patrol and reported to a nearby highway patrol officer. Said officer moved up and was on my six for a few miles before I spotted him, or his blues… oops. Here’s where it got weird. We pulled over and waited to be yanked out of our vehicles and hauled off. We were running double the posted speed limit. The trooper walked by my window, yanked my documents out of my hand and proceeded to the front vehicle. On his way to the front vehicle he looked at my license and froze in his tracks. He turned and came back to my window and apologetically asked what my hurry was. I answered honestly telling him that there was no hurry , that we were just being idiots. We ended up standing at the rear of his patrol vehicle drinking Cokes (from his cooler) and talking cars. He was impressed with the work done on my friends car. We were released to go on our way (no citation). I did not ask who he thought I was, that would have blown whatever cover I had. This was back in the early 1980s and to this day I do not know who he thought I was. I never pushed my luck like that again.

A Every time you fold a piece of paper it doubles in size. The human mind has not evolved to intuit exponential growth. Doubling paper 103 times does not seem like a lot but if you could do it, it would indeed result in a folded piece of paper thicker than the width of the observable universe. I think this is easier to understand if you imagine unfolding the piece of paper. After you unfold the paper the first time it is only half the width of the universe. Half a universe is a lot of width to loose in one go. After you unfold the paper the second time it is only 1/4 of the width of the universe. After the third time it is only 1/8 of the width of the universe. After the fourth time it is only 1/16 of the width of the universe. After the fifth time it is only 1/32 of the width of the universe. Every five times you unfold the paper its width is 1/32 of what it was. I’m going to do some very rough calculations. And I mean very rough. I’m going to do them in my head without the benefit of a calculator or even paper and pencil. And I’m going to drastically round the numbers to make the calculation easier. The calculations are only meant to give you a feel for what happens as you unfold the paper. The known universe is about 93 billion light years across. After unfolding the paper five times it is 1/32 of the width of the universe or 3 billion light years thick. (I said my calculations would be a very rough.) There were 103 folds to start; with there are still 98 folds to go. Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 3 billion light years thick, or 1/10 of a billion light years which is to say it is 100 million light years thick. There are still 93 folds to go. Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 100 million light years thick, which means it is 3 million light years thick. There are still 88 folds to go. Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 3 million light years thick, which means it is 1/10 of a million light years thick, which means it is 100 thousand light years thick. There are still 83 folds to go. Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 100 thousand light years thick, which means it is 3 thousand light years thick. There are still 78 folds to go. Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 3 thousand light years thick, which means it is 1/10 of a thousand light years thick, or 100 light years thick. There are still 73 folds to go.

Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 3 light years thick, which means it is 1/10 of a light year thick.

Unfold the paper another five times and it is 1/32 of 1/3 of an inch thick, which means it is 1/90 of an inch thick. There are still 3 folds to go. Unfold the paper another three times and it is 1/8 of 1/90 of an inch thick, which means the paper is 1/700 of an inch thick. I promised you a very rough calculation and that’s what you got. I doubt the paper is actually that thin. The result isn’t perfect, but it is definitely in the ballpark. And it shows how doubling the width of a thin piece of paper over and over very quickly produces ginormous results.

Will he forgive me because I feel guilty?","output":"Reformation is a golden opportunity given by God to us. It consists of three steps. The first step is related to knowledge. It is realization or jñāna yoga, which is identifying the sin through analysis. The second step is related to emotions and it involves sincere repentance before God with deep devotion to Him, which is bhakti yoga. The third and final step, is the practical step of karma yoga in which you should not repeat the same sin in your life. Many fail in the third step. It is of no use because the third step is practical and the first two steps are merely theoretical. A person can be said to be reformed only when he does not repeat the sin practically. Some clever people try to exploit this concept thinking that they will reform their souls, just before death! Such over-intelligence brings double punishment as no one can cheat God since He is omniscient! It is perfectly correct to say that a soul cannot remain idle; simply keeping silent without doing any action. This is clearly told in the Gītā “Nahi kaścit kṣaṇamapi”. Even the Veda recommends action “Kurvanneveha karmāṇi…”. God never asks you to become inactive like an inert stone. Such inactivity is not only impossible but is also useless in the spiritual path. You have to learn both activity and inactivity in life. Inactivity should be applied in the context of doing or even desiring to do a sin. In other words, one should avoid doing or even desiring to do a sin. Activity should be applied by ordinary human beings following pravṛtti in doing good deeds that help society. Activity should be applied by exceptional devotees following nivṛtti in doing God’s work. The Gītā stresses on both activity and inactivity in the context of these two separate paths respectively. In both these paths, you should do the work without getting attached to the fruit due to selfishness. When you are detached from the fruit of the work, you can do the work perfectly by concentrating your entire energy on the work (Karmaṇyevādhikāraste—Gītā). Devotees like Śaṅkara, Meera etc. jumped straight to God’s work, avoiding all worldly work from their very childhood. It is a direct jump to salvation from the worldly bonds which is called as sākṣānmukti and is attained by forming a very strong bond with God. Devotees like Rāmānuja, Janaka etc., walked towards the same goal of salvation from worldly bonds passing through all the four states of life, which are known as the āśramas. This gradual walking towards the goal is called kramamukti and is applicable to the majority of human beings. Severe Punishment Without a Serious Sin Sometimes, we are punished here severely, even though we have not committed a sin, which is deserving of such a severe punishment. We get confused in such a situation thinking that God is cruel and a sadist. Such thinking is only due to our ignorance. In fact, the punishments for our sins are usually given only in the upper sub-world called hell. The reason is that we should not be disturbed in this sub-world called earth or Martya Loka while performing our worldly and divine duties. The upper worlds and sub-worlds are called bhoga lokas, which are places for enjoying the good and bad fruits of our deeds. Earth, on the other hand is called a karma loka, which is a place for doing deeds. This is the general rule, but there are some exceptions to the rule. One exception is that intensive sins done here are punished here itself immediately. Another exception is that sometimes, the punishment for a sin committed in the previous birth is received here on earth. This happens in the case of killing animals for food. The killed animal thinks while dying that it too will kill the killer in the same way. So the animal of the previous birth is reborn as a butcher while the butcher and the consumers of the meat in the previous birth are born as animals and are killed by the butcher. In both these exceptions, the soul receives severe punishments here due to intensive sins committed previously in this birth or in the past birth respectively. The case mentioned above, in which the soul is severely punished here in spite of not having done an equally severe sin in this birth, is different from the above two exceptions. In this case, since no severe sin has been done in this birth, as per the general rule, the soul should not be punished here for any sin done by it in the past birth. Why then is the soul punished here severely? This case is covered under another exceptional rule. Note that God is all-in-all. He is the Maker of the rules, and is beyond all the rules. Whenever He breaks any rule, it is only for some good purpose. All these rules regarding a soul’s deeds and the rewards and punishments for the deeds are only for the soul’s reformation. God does not give any punishment to a soul out of revenge. He is the Doctor who is treating the patient. The soul is the patient, who is to be cured. Sometimes, God feels that a person will be benefited and his or her reformation will progress better if some punishment is given at a certain time. So, He brings to the present life, a punishment which the soul was supposed to face in a future lifetime. It is like the premature withdrawal of a deposit from a bank, which leads to a loss in the value of the deposit. So the punishment, when preponed to the present, reduces in value. This is a benefit to the soul. Additionally, it accelerates the reformation of the soul. So, the soul gets a double benefit! This exception is made in the best interest of the soul. It is like the Supreme Doctor, God, deciding to increase the dosage of antibiotics for a patient, deviating from the regular treatment plan, to speed up the recovery of the patient. This exceptional rule, like all other rules related to the administration of the deeds of souls, clearly shows the loving kindness of God, the Divine Father for the souls, who are His children. God gave freedom to all souls so that they could do whatever they felt was good. God helped the souls in determining what is good and what is bad by preaching to them through holy scriptures, holy devotees and holy Incarnations. Freedom means the complete freedom for all souls in this creation to act in any direction, without the slightest force on the mind, either here or in the upper worlds. God always preaches to every soul to bring the realization of the truth to the soul and to reform the soul. The soul is expected to realize and get reformed only through this knowledge introduced into the mind of the soul. It is the only way the soul can be saved. The only force used by God on the mind of a sinner is imparting knowledge. He does not use any physical force or miraculous power to reform the sinner. The king tries to reform the sinner through physical force in the form of punishment, but such reformation is only temporary. Even the horrible punishments in hell cannot reform the soul permanently. Eternal reformation can never be attained through punishment. In spite of this defect of punishment, it is still used to reform the soul temporarily. Only the spiritual knowledge given by God-in-human-form can bring an eternal reformation in a soul. Generally, the cloud rains everywhere and the rain makes the seed present in fertile soil to grow up into a plant. But a seed fallen on rocky soil cannot give rise to a plant immediately in spite of a lot of rain. Devilish or demonic souls are like the rocks present here and there on earth. The God-cloud does not use His miraculous power to change the rocky soil into fertile soil since God never interferes with souls using any type of force. Judas was like rocky soil. But due to his association with Jesus and continuously listening to His preaching, he realized, confessed his sin, and punished himself at the end. The priests of the temple never listened to the preaching of Jesus at all and so they never got reformed. They were like solid rocks. Judas was like soil having some rocky nature. So, the seed of reformation at least germinated in him, even though it germinated late. For a person’s reformation, apart from the divine force of spiritual knowledge, the receptivity of the person’s mind is also important. There are some good souls with high receptivity for the knowledge. They are like good soil and they get reformed immediately on listening to the spiritual knowledge preached by the Human Incarnation of God. Then there are some average souls, who are like rocky soil. They take some time to get reformed like Judas. Both these types of souls are reformed and saved. But there are some other souls like the priests who crucified Jesus, who have no hope of reformation at all. They are like solid rocks and they are condemned forever. This worst type of souls is punished in the liquid fire of hell forever. Their punishment is forever because such souls will never get reformed. They are kept aloof from mankind in the lives of wild animals, worms and so on (Tānahaṁ dviṣataḥ...—Gita). God’s attempts to reform are confined only to the first and second types of souls who are like good soil and rocky soil respectively. The moment a soul is reformed, it is saved forever.

With a few exceptions, elements with nuclei containing an odd number of protons are far less abundant in the universe than neighbors to their right or left on the periodic table. Most people would be surprised to learn that platinum is considerably more abundant than gold in the crust, even though its cost makes it appear less abundant. Depending on the source, platinum is at least 4x more abundant than gold. (EDIT: platinum was once more expensive than gold. But this is unlikely to be the case going forward).It is a Period 6 element. Again, with a few exceptions, the higher the period the more abundant the element. Put plainly, Period 1 elements (hydrogen, helium) are the most abundant in the universe, then the ones in Period 2, then Period 3, and so on. By the time you get to the Period 6 transition metals, you are no longer measuring their abundance on Earth’s Crust in parts per thousand… try parts per billion for some of these elements. Some of the rarest, non-radioactive metals in Earth’s Crust clock in at 0.5 part per billion.Its super high density. Go all the way back to the time when Earth was forming. It was a partially molten metal fireball. In such an environment, the densest materials would have sunk to the center (which now forms the core) and the lighter materials (the metal oxides and silicates) would have risen towards the top (i.e., the Crust). The innermost layers of Earth are the densest, and the outermost layers are the least dense. Gold, along with all of the other super dense metals in Period 6, are expected to be depleted in the crust and enriched towards the core.#4 is related to #3. Gold is a “siderophile” element. An element designated as siderophile is one which dissolves more easily in molten iron than in molten rock. That means that siderophile elements (i.e., the heavier metals) should be enriched in the parts of the Earth which are full of iron (inner core, outer core) and depleted where there is less iron (mantle, crust, oceans, atmosphere). Gold is not a rock-forming element. Also, it does not dissolve in or react with water in its native state. And given its density, you do not find a whole lot of it in the atmosphere. And for the second part of your question… you don’t really need advanced mining techniques to extract gold. The old ways still work. The reason for this is that gold is among the few metals which can be found in the native state (meaning, unbound to oxygen and as the pure element). Other metals that can be found this way are copper and silver (both of which are in the same group as gold). Gold is rare and valuable because of its low abundance. And it is very valuable for many reasons, including its excellent electrical conductivity and exceptional resistance to oxidation.

The photo depicts a milkman delivering milk in a London street destroyed after a German bombing raid. A few firemen are trying to put out a fire in the background. The photo was taken during The Blitz which was a German bombing offensive against Britain in 1940 and 1941, during WW2. The Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns and cities in an effort to demoralise the British in to surrender. Around 30,000 people died and around 50,000 were injured as a result of the bombings. Photos taken to document the extensive damage caused by the bombing was routinely censored to avoid the spread of mass panic and to not reveal the locations of bombings to the Germans. The London Milkman photo didn't end up being censored as it symbolised the defiant character of the British and ended up boosting the morale of the British citizens. But this photo was actually staged. Fred Morley was taking photographs of firemen trying to contain a fire caused by the bombing. He had seen a milkman nearby and borrowed his outfit and a craft of bottles. He then got his assistant to pose as the milkman with the fire man as the backdrop. It is said that he did so in order to overcome the censorship and create awareness the extent of the damage caused. The trick worked and an iconic photograph was born.

Visitors are asked to leave stuff on my list in their vehicles (I have a few hair raising stories about this).Add charcoal tabs & pressure bandages to your dog’s 1st aid kit & a spray on combination analgesic-antiseptic. You should also make friends with a local 501(c)3 rescue. Resolve to make at least a small yearly donation to their efforts. Find their page on Facebook & crosspost their dogs once in a while. If you order off Amazon, you can donate a buck each order to any 501(c)3 rescue that’s registered with them (so check that out when deciding which you want to befriend) when you order something. They can be a goldmine of advice, needed items & help in an emergency.Research (google is your friend) what things dogs mostly get choked on, into & poisoned by, unsafe toys & make a list. Keep these items out of your dog’s reach (& environment if possible). Find & subscribe to email delivery from the website of the organization that tracks dogfood recalls.If you have people in your life who also have dogs, make sure both yours & theirs meet leashed & on neutral ground 1st time. Never forget dogs are territorial & if the meeting & introduction doesn’t go well, don’t chance a bloody fight later.Check your place for hazards, floor cracks, thresholds that could hang a nail for ex., fragile glass objects on a low shelf, anything sticking out that might poke a dog level eye in the dark.

Gun Rights - The right to bear arms and the right to self defence is essential, and that these rights were eroded partly explains the current state of the country. The government should serve us, and be more scared of us, than we are of them. We are currently helpless, and the mercery of a police *service* whom few have confidence in, and a court system which frequently makes rulings which leave the public shocked. Abortion - is already illegal in this country. However, the law has holes you can drive a bus through, and the law isn’t enforced. I would very much like our laws enforced, without fear or favour. Gay Marriage - Of the very few legitimate purposes of government, enforcing the law is one of them. This includes contract law, and marriage is a legal contract (The church didn’t get into the marriage business for common folk, until such time as common folk had money to pay for weddings). Gay people should have as much right to protection under the law as anyone else and the legislation for gay marriage should have come sooner than it did, but it was held up by concerns about how this would affect the church — guarantees for religious protections were given.

When a hype is created around a person who does not deserve so much then the person definitely starts getting disliked. This applies to anything. Firstly everyone says she has won Miss World, but Sushmita Sen won Miss Universe, why there is not so much of fandom for Ms Sen then? Next they say she's a very good dancer, I think there are many better dancers living without all the spotlight. Third a good actor, which I don't accept at all. Her acting is as plastic as her looks. So finally for me she's just a moderate dancer who won Miss World. And no one cares about such titles outside India these days. Ps. I love her dancing and I think she was beautiful( btw there are many who are beautiful). Just over rated."},{"instruction":"When I was a child, Smokey Bear said Only YOU can prevent forest fires.

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","output":"There is no such point, and it would be different for each person. For an average modern Greek, with no special or extended education, i believe the main issue would be the differing grammar structure. It’s not a matter of a point where they will stop understanding, but of missing some meanings of some phrases perhaps, which would contribute perhaps to missing some important point in a piece of text. Some words are identical in ancient and modern times. Some words simply are not in use today. Some words have a slightly different meaning. If one adapts to the different grammar structure, things become more understandable. It also depends on the author though, highly intellectual ancient authors have high complexity in their writings."},{"instruction":"What type of binoculars and magnification would be good for looking at satellites and the ISS?","output":"None except the most powerful have any hope of showing much detail.

Let’s start building the function. Since [math]f(f(1)) = 3[/math], and [math]f[/math] is increasing, the only option is [math]f(1) = 2[/math], and we have [math]f(1) = 2[/math] [math]f(2) = 3[/math] [math]f(3) = 5[/math] [math]f(5) = 7[/math] which forces [math]f(4) = 6[/math] Then we can go ahead and get [math]f(6) = 9[/math] [math]f(7) = 11[/math] [math]f(9) = 13[/math] And we got “lucky” again because there’s only one possible value for the next gap [math]f(8) = 12[/math] But I claim that was no luck. The gap between [math]f(7)[/math] and [math]f(9)[/math] was exactly [math]2[/math] because [math]7[/math] and [math]9[/math] were the images of two consecutive numbers (namely [math]5[/math] and [math]6[/math]) So, if we can prove that the gap between two consecutive images is always [math]1[/math] or [math]2[/math], we’re done. Why? If a number [math]n[/math] has already appeared in the second column, i.e. if it is [math]f(k)[/math] for some [math]k[/math], then we know that [math]f(n)[/math] will be [math]2k+1[/math]. Otherwise, we’ll have to have a [math]k[/math] such that [math]f(k) = n-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = n+1[/math], which means that [math]f(n-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(n+1) = 2k+3[/math], and [math]f(n)[/math] is forced to be [math]2k+2[/math]. So let’s prove that Claim: For every [math]k in N[/math], [math]f(k+1) - f(k) in {1,2}[/math] Proof: We’ve already proved this for [math]k leq 9[/math]. Now assume this is true for all [math]k < m > 7[/math]. We want to prove that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math] or [math]2[/math]. Since [math]f(m-1) > m+1[/math] (given that [math]f(7) = 11 > 7+1[/math] and that [math]f[/math] is strictly increasing, which means that [math]f(n) - n[/math] is non-decreasing), and, by hypothesis, there is no gap bigger than 2 in the consecutive values of the function up to this point, that means that ther exists a [math]k < m[/math] such that either [math]f(k) = m[/math] or [math]f(k) = m-1[/math]. Suppose that both [math]m[/math] and [math]m-1[/math] are in the image of [math]f[/math]. Then necessarily (by monotonicity), we need to have [math]f(k) = m-1[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math] for some [math]k[/math], which means that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 2k + 3 - (2k + 1) = 2[/math], and we’re done. If [math]m[/math] isn’t on the image, by the induction hypothesis, we’ll have a [math]k<m[/math] such that [math]f(k) = m-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = m+1[/math], which means that [math]f(m-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m+1) = 2k+3[/math], hence [math]f(m) = 2k+2[/math] and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], done. The only case left is that [math]m[/math] is on the image of [math]f[/math], but [math]m-1[/math] is not. Then we have [math]f(k) = m-2[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math], [math]f(m-2) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m) = 2k+3[/math], [math]f(m-1) = 2k+2[/math], and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], Q.E.D. PS: naively, one would expect [math]f(n)/n[/math] to converge to [math]sqrt{2}[/math], but it doesn’t seem to be true. Actually, [math]f(n)/n[/math] oscillates between 4/3 and 3/2. Here’s the plot of [math]f(n)/n[/math] for [math]n<10^7[/math] The distance between consecutive crests (or valleys) grows exponentially, with a factor of 2, since [math]f(n) = 3/2 ; n Rightarrow f(3/2 ; n) = 2n + 1 = 4/3 ; (3/2 ; n) + 1Rightarrow f(2n+1) = 3n + 1 = 3/2 ; (2n + 1) - 1/2[/math] PPS: The simple pyhton script I used to calculate [math]f[/math] up to [math]10^7[/math]: f = {1:2} k=1 for i in range(2,10000000): while f[k] < i: k = k+1 if f[k] == i: f[i] = 2*k+1 if f[k] == i+1: f[i] = 2*k"},{"instruction":"Was there always a sevenday week?","output":"No. [LINKED_TEXT: Week - WikipediaTime unit equal to seven days A week is a unit of time equal to seven days . It is the standard time period used for short cycles of days in most parts of the world. The days are often used to indicate common work days and rest days, as well as days of worship . Weeks are often mapped against yearly calendars , but are typically not the basis for them, as weeks are not based on astronomy. The modern seven-day week can be traced back to the Babylonians , who used it within their calendar. Other ancient cultures had different week lengths, including ten in Egypt and an eight-day week for Etruscans. The Etruscan week was adopted by the Ancient Romans, but they later moved to a seven-day week, which had spread across Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean. In 321 AD, Emperor Constantine officially decreed a seven-day week in the Roman Empire, including making Sunday a public holiday. [1] [2] This later spread across Europe, then the rest of the world. World map showing the first day of the week used in different countries according to the Common Locale Data Repository [3] Monday Friday Saturday Sunday In English, the names of the days of the week are Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , and Sunday . In many languages, the days of the week are named after gods or planets visible to the eye . Such a week may be called a planetary week . [4] Certain weeks within a year may be designated for a particular purpose, such as Holy Week in Christianity, Golden Week in China, and National Family Week in Canada. More informally, certain groups may advocate awareness weeks , which are designed to draw attention to a certain subject or cause. The term \\"week\\" may also be used to refer to a sub-section of the week, such as the workweek and weekend . Cultures vary in which days of the week are designated the first and the last, though virtually all have Saturday, Sunday or Monday as the first day. The Geneva -based ISO standards organization uses Monday as the first day of the week in its ISO week date system through the international ISO 8601 standard. [a] Most of Europe and China consider Monday the first day of the week, most of North America and South Asia consider Sunday the first day, while Saturday is judged as the first day of the week in much of the Middle East and North Africa . Other regions are mixed, but typically observe either Sunday or Monday as the first day. [3] The Jewish week ends with nightfall on Saturday, at the conclusion of the Sabbath, following the Hebrew Bible in which God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. Some Christians set their Sabbath to Sunday, so as not to coincide with Judaism . Muslims set their Sabbath to Friday because it was described as a sacred day of worship in the Quran . [5] The English word week comes from the Old English wice , ultimately from a Common Germanic * wikōn- , from a root * wik- \\"turn, move, change\\". The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to thhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#%22Weeks%22_in_other_calendars] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#%22Weeks%22_in_other_calendars]Various calendars have used different numbers of days as week lengths. The Romans apparently used 8 day weeks. If I had to guess, I’d say standardisation on a 7 day week in Europe happened after Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity.

What might change would be if the engine failure destroyed more sub-systems - i.e., more than one hydraulic system. Pilots routinely are exposed to single problems in the simulator. Engine fire, loss of cabin pressure, etc. What they are not exposed to is every possible combination of compound failures. For example, they are not exposed to two engine failures - US Airways 1549 in the Hudson river. In my career, there were incidents which we had trained for in the simulator and were dealt with correctly. I never have had multiple failures or emergencies in any of the aircraft I’ve flown.

They meet to determine the scope of the current sprint and which backlog items will be addressed in the following sprint.

Procrastination - Procrastination is the enemy of progress. When we delay important tasks, we increase the likelihood of feeling overwhelmed and stressed. This can also lead to missing deadlines and opportunities. Instead, prioritize your tasks and start working on the most important ones first.Negative self-talk - The way we talk to ourselves has a huge impact on our self-esteem and confidence. Negative self-talk, such as \\"I'm not good enough\\" or \\"I'll never be able to do this,\\" can be detrimental to our mental and emotional well-being. Instead, focus on speaking to yourself with kindness and compassion.Toxic relationships - Surrounding yourself with people who are negative, manipulative, or abusive can have a serious impact on your mental and emotional health. It's important to recognize these toxic relationships and take steps to remove them from your life.Comparing yourself to others - Comparing yourself to others is a recipe for unhappiness. Everyone has their own unique journey, and it's important to focus on your own progress and growth, rather than trying to measure yourself against someone else.Overthinking - Overthinking can lead to stress and anxiety. It's important to learn how to recognize when you're getting bogged down in thoughts and to find ways to refocus your mind on the present moment.Living someone else's life - It's important to live life on your own terms, rather than trying to fulfill someone else's expectations. This includes pursuing your own interests and passions, rather than trying to conform to societal norms or expectations.Neglecting your physical and mental health - Neglecting your physical and mental health can have serious consequences. It's important to prioritize self-care, including getting regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and seeking support when needed.Holding onto grudges and resentment - Holding onto grudges and resentment can be toxic to your mental and emotional well-being. It's important to learn how to forgive others, and to let go of anger and bitterness.Being afraid of failure - Fear of failure can hold us back from pursuing our goals and dreams. It's important to embrace the possibility of failure, and to understand that setbacks and mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow.Living in the past or future - Living in the past or the future can prevent you from fully experiencing the present moment.

India is import oriented country where we Imports more compared to export. So in order to pay our high import oil, gold and other items bill we need to pay them in dollor and for it we required foreign currency reserve and to get the foreign currency we need other international market to import our good ( Export for us) for this our goods should be cheaper for this our currency value should also be lower. But suppose if one dollor is equal to one rupee then who so ever will buy the products from india same things they will buy from other country where currency rates are cheaper or else he would buy the same product from USA only. Thus our export will be lower and Import will be higher. Thus the current account deficit of our country will be no longer positive and than how we will be in the condition which we cannot even think about it.

Is it, If you are thinking like that then you are wrong because If a USA company hiring a US employee than they will have to at least pay them for 4000–5000 per month whereas they get the same work done by outsourcing them to Indian BPO at low labor cost of around 300-400.

TOP 15 WAYS TO CURE BAD BREATH NATURALLY! Hey, I am a registered nurse with over 5 years of experience. Let me share all of you about my experience to cure bad breath as below. 1: Warm Salt Water Rinse A salt water (saline solution) rinse can prevent the buildup of infectious bacteria in the mouth or throat. The effect is probably due to salt water’s slight acidity. This prevents the ‘alkalizing’ environment that encourages the growth of microbes that cause bad breath. Salt water is a great, simple home remedy for bad breath. 2: Use BadBreathFreeForever technique: Bad Breath Free Forever by James Williams is an all-natural and step-by-step holistic guide that teaches you how to get rid of bad breath naturally. without affecting your health and getting results in a short amount of time.

More details: [LINKED_TEXT: BadBreathFreeForever technique] [URL: https://badbreathtips888.blogspot.com/2019/05/badbreathfreeforever-technique.html] 3: Digestive Enzymes Your bad breath may be caused by your digestive system. If you have digestive problems and suffer from bad breath too, digestive enzymes may help your digestion. Digestive enzyme products come from different sources. The most common are:  Animal-sourced — including pancreatin sourced from ox or hog. This can include betaine  HCL with pepsin  Bromelain and Papain are digestive enzymes contained in pineapple  Other plant-sourced — from probiotics, yeast, and fungi 4: Cinnamon Chewing Sticks Cinnamon is known to have antimicrobial action. It’s also proved effective against bacteria that cause oral infections in some studies. Cinnamon is also thought to have thought to have digestive and respiratory benefits, although more research is needed. Cinnamon chewing sticks also contain fiber that supports microbial diversity in the mouth. 5: Green tea Research has found that green tea temporarily reduces malodor due to its antibacterial and deodorant action. This is probably due to the actions of the polyphenols, antioxidants it contains. You can try drinking 3-5 cups of green tea per day or taking a polyphenol EGCG supplement. 6: Aloe Vera Aloe Vera is a natural antifungal and antibacterial plant extract. Research has shown it’s as effective as chlorhexidine mouthwash at reducing plaque. It also boosts the creation of collagen, improving the mouth’s ability to heal. You can make your own Aloe Vera mouthwash to combat bad breath. Simply boil some water and add aloe Vera gel once it is cooled. You can also add peppermint oil to taste. 7: Prevent oxygen deprivation There are two important links between bad breath and lack of oxygen.  Mouth breathing and oxygen deprivation Your body isn’t designed to breathe through your mouth. It’s designed to breathe through your nose. Your nasal passages are specially designed to release nitric oxide. This increases blood flow and delivery of oxygen to the cells. In contrast, mouth breathing pulls cold, dry air to the lungs. A lower amount of oxygen is to delivered to your body. Mouth breathing can also reduce saliva flow and allow unwanted microbiota into your mouth and throat. It’s quite common to breathe through our mouths during sleep. However, many people, especially children, also breathe through their mouth during the day. If you experience ‘morning breath’ – or bad breath that only occurs on waking – you probably sleep with your mouth open. One way to alleviate this is to train your body to breathe through your nose. You can also use a strip to keep your mouth closed at night to make sure you breathe through your nose. If you struggle to breathe through your nose, you should consult a sleep specialist, dentist or ENT doctor. They can conduct a full sleep and breathing study. Nose Breathing Exercise: Hold your tongue to the roof of your mouth, behind your front teeth. Breathe in through your nose, making your belly rise. Breathe in for 3 seconds and exhale for 4 seconds. Do this for 2-3 minutes daily.  Anaerobic bacteria and oxygen deprivation Bad breath is most commonly caused by anaerobic bacteria in your mouth. These bugs thrive in the absence of oxygen, producing chemicals that cause bad breath. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) can increase your oxygen intake. In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, the air pressure is increased to three times higher than normal and pure oxygen is administered. Under these conditions, your lungs absorb far more of the pure oxygen than they would at normal pressure. Hyperbaric oxygen is known to help gangrene, skin and bone infections and non-healing ulcers. At present, research is limited and mainly confined to sports injuries. However, we know that bacteria that produce bad breath compounds thrive in mouth crevices where oxygen can’t reach. 8:Hydration Drink more water. Hydration will help maintain saliva flow and keep your mouth moist, discouraging bacterial growth. Cut down on diuretics. Diuretics such as coffee, black tea, and alcohol increase fluid loss and may cause dry mouth. 9: Oral hygiene Stop nasty bacteria from building up on your gums and teeth. Oral hygiene. Regular oral hygiene, including interdental cleaning with floss, will help to prevent bad breath. Brush your tongue. The bacteria that cause bad breath are often found on the topside of your tongue. If you can see a white coating on your tongue, you should remove this debris with a tongue cleaner. 10: Exercise Daily exercises help to increase your ventilation and circulation rate. This helps to increase cellular turnover throughout your body. Exercise has also been shown to be good for maintaining microbiome health. This may help to manage harmful bugs that cause bad breath. 11: Decrease your stress Stress can change your body’s odor. One natural remedy for reducing bad breath may be to get your stress under control. Bad breath is a sign that both your immune system and microbiome aren’t working the way they should. Chronic stress can damage your immune system and reduce your ability to respond to your environment. Central to this is your microbiome. Stress as a cause of bad breath may be due to its ability to cause odor. We know stress increases sweat gland activity. These secretions interact with bacteria in your body to create body odor. However, stress itself may change your body’s bacteria. Research has shown in mice studies that the microbiome can lose diversity when exposed to chronic stress. 12: Get good quality sleep and rest Lack of sleep can negatively affect both your immune system, microbiome and stress response. We also know that sleep helps your immune system to effectively ‘remember’ its environment. Researchers have also found that your gut microbiome plays a role in your diurnal rhythm. If you have bad breath, it’s worth looking at your sleep patterns and trying to ensure you get enough good quality sleep. 13: Essential oils Many toothpaste and mouthwashes claim to kill bacteria that cause bad breath. However, we know little about what these products do to the whole microbiome. Natural products with antimicrobial properties may be more effective in preserving ‘friendly’ bacteria. Peppermint essential oil For bad breath, try gargling with peppermint oil, a potent anti-microbialthat kills off harmful bacteria and leaves the breath fresh. Mix 1-2 drops with water and swish the mixture around your mouth for 30 seconds. Lemongrass essential oil Lemongrass has antimicrobial properties that inhibit certain bacteria, both internally and externally. It is also known to be effective against bacterial infections in the colon. Lemongrass oil may be used as an internal or external preparation. Chewing lemon rind may also be effective. Eucalyptus essential oil Eucalyptus oil is well-known for its ability to reduce mucus production. It also boosts the immune system, reduces inflammation, and acts as an antioxidant, antimicrobial and pain reliever. Clove essential oil Clove oil contains antifungal and antimicrobial compounds that may act against bacteria that cause bad breath and digestive problems. It’s used as a natural pain reliever, especially for dental emergencies. You can add a few drops of clove oil to water as a natural bad breath remedy. Orange essential oil Cleaning products are often scented with orange due to its anti-odor properties. Orange oil is rich in the antioxidant limonene, which may help to fight bad breath causing microbes. You can add a few drops of concentrated orange oil to water to make a drink or peel orange rind straight from the orange and chew it. Consult your dentist before trying these oils as a cure for bad breath, and don’t use them for more than 2-3 weeks. You can try combining them to suit your taste. 14: Skin Rubs Your skin microbiome communicates with your oral microbiome. Therefore, rubbing certain pleasant-smelling essential oils on your skin could have a positive effect on your bad breath. You can add these to a bath or add diluted to the skin. Tea tree oil is well known for its antibacterial properties. It’s especially effective against bacteria that live on the skin. Lavender oil is another natural anti-microbial oil that will leave your skin smelling fresh. Add a few drops to a damp cloth and dab onto your skin. 15: Zinc Zinc is an important trace element your body. It’s estimated that over 300 cellular functions, including your DNA, use zinc. This includes the microbiome, including mouth and gut flora. However, while more studies are needed, zinc seems to stop the build-up of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) that can cause bad breath. You can try a zinc mouthwash or chewing gum to treat your bad breath. Zinc gluconate and zinc citrate have also been shown to have a small effect on oral plaque build-up. Zinc supplements are thought to help improve immune function too and may help to rebalance the microbiome. For the common cold, doses range from 4.5-24 milligrams of zinc (gluconate or acetate) in the form of lozenges. These are taken every 1-3 hours for 3-14 days or until symptoms resolve. Always check with your health practitioner before taking higher doses of zinc."},{"instruction":"What is the best browser compatibility testing tool?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: browserling - interactive cross-browser testing] [URL: https://browserling.com/]"},{"instruction":"What would you say is the best financial investment?","output":"Investing in knowledge and happiness.

I was on my way to work after school let out. In rural North Georgia the opportunities for part employment offered to high school students was somewhat limited so I had to commute 20 miles to the next county to work at the nearest Wal-Mart. The advantage / disadvantage of this commute, depending directly on whether it was made pre ticket or post ticket, is that it was very wide open, had plenty of straight-aways, and made for a very fun time-trial track (11 mins if I remember correctly). Unfortunately, most things that are fun are usually frowned upon by society and local governments have to have revenue to fund wasteful spending but I digress. That particular afternoon was in the late spring on a beautiful day with perfect weather. The kind of day where it just feels right to power down the windows of your 1994 Mazda MX-6 LS, pop “Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water” into the CD player, punch in number 14, and ease out of the parking lot onto the highway, all while the wonderfully melodious voices of DMX and Limp Bizkit serinade the world with “Rollin’ (Urban Assault Vehicle)”. Everything is going great as I'm cruising down GA State Hwy 515 at a reasonable 80 or 85 mph, honestly, it's too nice of a day to hurry up and get to work anyways. When out of nowhere a Honda Civic blows my doors off. “What the Vtec?” I mutter to myself, as I drop it down to 4th. I put my foot into it, waking up the ol’ 2.5L V6 Ford Probe motor and give chase. It didn't take long to catch them. We proceed to race for a mile or so and I decide to run off and leave them. It was at this point I happen to look up and see blue lights in my rear view mirror. A good ways back but definitely there. The age old dilemma every young man must struggle with enters my mind. In the end, rational thought wins out and I opt to pull over instead of run. I can honestly say that is probably angriest I have ever seen an officer mad at me. She was an older woman, I believe the commander of the local State Patrol Post, and she gave me the lecture of lifetime. After it was all said and done she issued me a citation for 90+ in a 65, wrote on the ticket that she had to chase me for 2 miles and I passed the car she had radared. I was also told that if I went to court she would get me for every bit of 140. A cool little side note, Francis Bennett was one of the four original first female Georgia State Troopers. After getting advice from the real estate attorney my grandmother worked for I secured a meeting with the judge outside of court. I ended up paying a 250 fine, attending a defensive driving course, and the judge agreed to drop the ticket. I really didn't learn my lesson from that slap on the wrist. The second time was close to a decade later and the culmination of a productive career of funding many local bureaucratic misappropriations, sorry digression again. In 2013, my wife and I, mostly my wife, felt that our 2006 Pontiac GTO wasn't big enough to be a family vehicle and we needed to trade it in. The GTO was a beast of a car that had a 6.0L V8 LS2 that definitely lived up to it's nicknames. The GOAT (greatest of all time) or GTO (gas, tires, and oil). So the only logical replacement for a car of this caliber is either a Cadillac CTS V or a Pontiac G8 GT. They are pretty much the same car but the Cadillac has a lot more features and options. The Cadillac Cts V is a very bad ass sedan and definitely would have been roomy enough. Unfortunately, well out of my price range, especially since I had almost a decade of speeding and laying drag tickets in my trophy room. After weeks of looking I found a 2009 Pontiac G8 GT in Jasper, Alabama. Who wouldn't drive 200 miles to purchase their dream car. Plus, it was a last adventure with the Goat and a new adventure with the G8, non car guys wouldn't understand. When we arrived at the dealership the G8 was parked in the showcase area and looked as awesome as the online pictures had portrayed. After careful and thorough examination it was time for a test drive. The salesman rode with us and off we went. I took the car through the normal paces, there is only so much you can do under the supervision of your wife and the salesman. But, as if Zeus himself had decided to free Atlas of the burden bestowed upon him, the salesman said something I'll never forget. “Let's see what this thing will do. I've never driven it, but I've heard it'll go.” he said. I didn't have to be told twice and I was already changing gears. All 415 hp immediately came to life as the 6.2L V8 LS3 took off down US Hwy 78. I'm cruising down the highway glancing down at the speedometer every few seconds watching it spin higher and higher. I had to be getting close to the governor. Nope, shit, governor deleted. Looked down, 157, looked up, blue lights in the oncoming lane. “Fuck” It's easy to run when it's dark. It's easy to run when you know the roads. It's really easy to run when you are on the opposite side of a divided highway. It's easy to run when the only life you are responsible for is your own. 1 out of 4 wasn't going to cut it. I got off on the next exit pulled into a gas station and hoped the divided highway worked in my favor. It did not. While I waited I did have time to work out a deal with the salesman that if I bought the car the dealership would pay the ticket. “How fast was you going?” was the first thing the Alabama State Trooper asked me. “What are you going to write the ticket for?” I responded. “109” he said pretty coldly. “I guess we can go with that” I replied. We ended up buying a fully loaded 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche LTZ Z71 in Chattanooga, TN a few weeks later. I never researched it but I got a good feeling if I had said anything more or he wrote that ticket for 110 or higher it would have not been pretty.

It describes the protagonist André Moreau without starting the book telling instead of showing all on the character, introducing enough of the general “type” of his person, and introducing an explanation of his background before the plot of the series (his foundling status, his adoptive family, life and how all that made him what he was and how he contrasted with his adoptive brother), so we can go straight to the actual plot after that. And more importantly: nothing later contradicts this description! (which would be a big problem in starting with making a big deal of a one sentence description of the lead and then the book being filled with things show that aren’t supporting with showing what is told.) There is a reason why not all adaptations of A Tale of Two Cities or any other of the books that people have described in their answers here (if they have any adaptations) start with a voiceover reading the opening or the line being said by a character or a title card or text with it, but the 1952 version just couldn’t start any other way but a card with that line, then on to the story (the 1923 version did not have the line to my memory, but silent film was a different media, in which picture and text was all, with no spoken dialogue, so it makes sense they jumped from the credits to text on Louis XVI’s reign and then on the specific setting of this story)."},{"instruction":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","output":"Why would I not believe them?"},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

He was a God and was very powerful in Mahabharat and yet I don't consider them the most powerful characters.There was a character who could have finished the war within a day; he came to take part in the war with only three arrows but was not allowed to take part and his name was Barbaric, son of Ghatotkach and grandson of Bheem. He was also powerful and yet I don't consider him the most powerful.Now the character who actively took part in the war and was most powerful was Bhishma and you could think that the character who had a boon to die when he desired, one of the most powerful and knowledgable people should be the most powerful character and yet I don't think so.There were many other characters like Pandavas, Karna, Drona, Duryodhan, etc. but none according to me was the most powerful character of Mahabharat. The reasons I don't consider them the most powerful character is because all of them were either God, possessed some kind of boon, weapon, etc. or were born to do some particular task and according to me that make them powerful characters but not a most powerful character. The most powerful character for me should be the one who did not possess any powerful weapons or boon and yet was able to make all of the above characters fight with each other. Just think about it, shouldn't that human is most powerful who just with his mind was able to make the God and son of Gods fight. The character who lived with his enemies in their own kingdom. The character who never wanted power. The character who was neglected by most characters. The character whose only motive was to get revenge for his sister.

They have no interest in actual Gun Reform where violent criminals are forced to serve prison terms; they are too busy releasing these people for “treatment” and claiming that prisons are inherently racist if the number of criminals isn’t equally distributed. Their sole, singular goal is to take the guns away from the honest, law-abiding people. Sometimes they settle for lesser victories, taking away only SOME of the guns, or taking them away in only SOME of the places. But taking the guns away is still the driving force. Because this is the goal of the Liberals, the Conservatives are denied the ability to seek meaningful compromise. Conservatives propose numerous common sense laws which would reduce violent crime, impose more severe penalties for criminals, and protect the citizens. The Liberals reject every one of these propositions for the same reason: it doesn’t help take guns away from law-abiding people. The Liberals interest is not in reducing the crime, or in saving the lives of their people. It is exclusively in disarming the citizens, so no solution aside from disarming people will be attempted. <-=O=-> Perhaps the perfect example would be when Democratic President Bill Clinton signed the bill which was passed by the Democrat Controlled House and Democrat Controlled Senate, banning all firearms on school grounds. This created these “Gun Free Zones” that Liberals had dreamed about for years. Finally, the children would be safe. No law-abiding people would be allowed to carry a gun. Almost three decades later, School Shootings have astronomically INCREASED as a result. The results were simple. Law abiding people stopped carrying guns. Criminals didn’t care what the law said, because they are criminals. And when Criminals arrived with guns, there were no longer good guys left who were prepared to stop them, so more children died. Total number of school shootings increased. Total body count associated with each school shooting increases. Children are dying as a direct result of a “gun ban”. And when they watch their new law killing children in a preventable way, the Liberals double down on it. Common sense gun reform gets proposed, like allowing teachers to take voluntary classes and training so that they could obtain a permit to carry on school grounds if they choose to. But this common sense gun reform that would save lives doesn’t get looked at for it’s own merit. Saving the lives of children isn’t a good thing if it doesn’t also ban guns. Banning guns is more important than saving lives. Those children are important sacrifices on the alter, so that Liberals can then cry about how a further gun ban is the only way to stop the thing that their current gun ban has already been increasing. <-=O=-> I am happy to talk gun reform. I have only one simple rule about it, a common sense rule that can be used as the measuring stick for all gun reform. If the goal is to reduce crime, then the reforms should negatively impact criminals. Talk to me about stricter punishments. Talk to me about three strike laws. Talk to me about longer sentences. Talk to me about mandatory minimums in prison, instead of paroles in 8 days. Talk to me about being hard on the criminals who are doing the stuff that we want to stop, and I will agree with you. If your whole position is to take away the self-defense tool from the single mother who has been repeatedly beaten by her ex-husband, or from the elderly couple who finds their lifelong home gradually surrounded by a ghetto after the local manufacturing places close and the property values plummet, or from the small business owner who works by himself, late at night, and runs the risk of getting shot over the few hundred dollars in the register, taking firearms away from people who have never done anything wrong, while still using the kiddie gloves on the violent criminals, that is something I won’t accept. I don’t care about your gun ban. I care about saving lives. Guns save more lives than they end."},{"instruction":"ve you left California and if so, why?","output":"I’m a 5th generation Californian of San Luis Obispo County. I had a good job at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant, but got laid off in 1999. In order to pay our rent, along with all our other expenses I had to work two full-time jobs. Because of this, and the fact that California politics we’re getting insane, we decided to leave. My family and I now live in Mississippi where we love the freedoms we were denied in California. For those of you that are thinking about leaving, but are not sure if it is any better somewhere else, Let me give you an idea of what you are missing and maybe encourage you and other lovers of liberty to seek greener pastures. I carry a firearm every day. No permit required to open or conceal carry.We purchased 2 acres for less than 20k. We built our house and no permits or inspections required. We do live rurally and permits may be required in town.Property tax for our 2 acres and a house is 300/year.Yearly vehicle registration is 35.No smog inspections. The state required a yearly vehicle inspection that cost 5, but the state abolished that about 5 years ago.Gas price today is 2.15. A few months ago it was 1.80.Drinking and driving is legal as long as you B.A.C is below 0.08.State “cottage laws” allow one to sell anything you make or grow on your property with no state requirements.State law mandates a tax free weekend for all fishing, hunting, firearm and ammo purchases on the third weekend of every September.State law forbids law enforcement from making copies of gun purchase records. They can look at them at the store, but that’s all.No state requirements for homeschooling.Yes, we know all our neighbors and even get together often.We don’t get bored waiting in line in Walmart, we just chat with whoever is in line with us.A traffic jam to us is 5 cars at the one stop light in town. Even when driving through the State capital, the largest city in the state, I’ve never been in a traffic jam.No one is in a huge rush, people are polite and anyone looking like they might be in trouble is soon surrounded with people wanting to help.I don’t know what the DMV is like now in California, but 20 years ago you almost had to spend the day in line. Here, I’m in and out in 15 minutes.The population of the greater Los Angeles area is about 18 million. That is 6 times the population of our whole state. Do I ever regret leaving California? Are you kidding! I’ve been back a few times to visit family and I can’t believe how much worse it has gotten in 20 years. To be fair, Mississippi does have some downsides that do concern me. Vaccines are mandatory for public school and only approved medical exemptions are allowed.Cannabis is still the “Devil’s Lettuce” here and is illegal, but it is decriminalized.While prices are the lowest in the nation, wages are also the lowest.While it is much better than it was 50 years ago, racism and segregation still exist to a small degree."},{"instruction":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","output":"I have never written a movie review before this but as soon as I saw the question, I knew I had to answer this. I don’t know the exact reason why I feel so. It may be because of the hype created around the movie or our emotional feelings attached to it due to Sushant Singh Rajput’s tragic demise last month. You may call it irony or destiny, but when Sushant’s character says his last words in the movie- “We don’t get to decide when we are born or when we die. But we do get to decide how to live this life,” you couldn’t differentiate between real life and reel life in this case. Today, when Sushant is no more, his story and legacy will continue to live in our hearts. Starcast: Sushant Singh Rajput, Sanjana Sanghi, Sahil Vaid, Swastika Mukherjee, Sawasta Chatterjee, Saif Ali Khan (in a cameo role). Plot: The movie is based on the famous novel “The fault in our stars” by John Green. The plot of the story is pretty straightforward and quite predicatable. Here is this girl Kizie Basu (played by Sanjana Sanghi) who is like any other normal girl who has her own dreams and aspirations. But she is suffering from thyroid cancer due to which she is dependent on her oxygen cylinder, which she carries everywhere, to keep her alive. Just when she thinks that life is all about sorrow and pain, she meets this person named Immanuel Rajkumar Junior aka Manny (played by Sushant Singh Rajput) who seems to be a romeo type guy at first, but later we come to know that he is fighting his own battle in life. Manny seems to be cheerful and full of energy from the outside, but deep inside he knows that he does not have much time to live, so he wants to enjoy the life to the fullest. He suffers from Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) due to which he had lost his right leg that had to be replaced by an artificial limb. In one of the scenes, he tells Kizie’s father that he had very big dreams but he doesn’t feel like fulfilling them. One of his dreams was playing basketball which he still managed to play, but in his own words, there was no thrill and satisfaction in it. When these two people fighting their own battles come across each other, they fall for each other and find a purpose to live. Kizie feels that she has found the reason to live and she feels special in his presence. Their sizzling chemistry progresses in each and every subsequent scene. There is this singer named Abhimanyu Veer Pratap whom Kizie adores very much and wants to know the reason why he had left one of his songs incomplete. One day to her surprise, she receives a mail from Abhimanyu, saying that she can come and meet him in Paris to find the answer to her question. When Kizie along with Manny, meet Abhimanyu (played by Saif Ali Khan) in a restaurant in Paris, this singer seems to be a psycho who ridicules all their questions with his irrelevant comments. When they finally decide to leave, Abhimanyu makes a very stark remark- “This song is incomplete because this life itself is incomplete.” Kizie is shaken to the core hearing his remarks and finds the truth of life hidden in his statement. But Manny reassures her that he will complete this song for her and everything will be fine one day. Side by side, there is this story of Manny’s friend Vaid who is losing his sight day by day and wants to complete the shoot of his film in which Manny and Kizie play the lead roles. As expected, the day comes when Manny gets hospitalized due to his disease, which affects Kizie a lot because she knows that their happiness is only short lived now. When Manny calls both of them in the church for their last speech (saying he wanted to attend his own funeral before he actually dies), the flow of emotions can’t be controlled. Kizie says, with tears in her eyes, “Just as he came into my life, quitely, he also exited. And left me all alone……. again.” At this moment, anyone watching this movie can feel the irony of life mocking us. Just as his character, Sushant also exited from our lives in reality, leaving us all alone. Acting: It would be injustice if we try to rate Sushant’s performance in this film, but even if I may be biased, I think this was his best performance in his career, after ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story.’ Sanjana Sanghi has also justified her role and played her part with perfection. The side characters have also performed their roles equally well. Direction: Honestly speaking, there is nothing new in this movie and it enters into the cliche track from the beginning. As the movie progresses, the hope of it turning out into something extraordinary fades away with each passing frame. The film moves at such a fast pace that it does not let the audience get absorbed in any of the scenes. Somehow, the brilliant performance by the lead stars of the film saves the film to some extent from bad direction. The climax is rushed through as if the director (Mukesh Chabra) wanted to finish it somehow. Overall, the movie itself is not able to make us emotional but it was due to the already attached feelings towards our hero Sushant, we feel a lump in our throat in the last scenes when Sushant’s character is dying slowly in the film. And when the movie ends, you search for a tissue to wipe your tears. Music: The songs are composed by AR Rehman and each song directly enters directly into our soul. But my favourite is “Khulke Jeene ka’ which is already in my playlist on the top. Final verdict: I would give 3.5/5 for the movie. It’s definitely a one time watch and will make you smile and cry at the same time. Considering you can watch it free for Hotstar, there is no reason to avoid watching it. Even if you have no reasons to watch this film, you can watch it once for this guy whom we are seeing on the silver screen for the last time………"},{"instruction":"Which is the best picture you saw on Instagram today?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: मेरा बचपन उपन्यास लेखक कृष्ण सैनी] [URL: https://mojikaeductionvecancy.blogspot.com/2021/06/blog-post_26.html] मेरा बचपन उपन्यास आपको आपके बचपन की ओर ले जाता है । दौड़ते दौड़ते जब हम लोग बड़ी सड़क पहुंचे तब शाम भी होने लगी थी । आसपास उजाला होने लगा था मेरा गला सूख रहा था और हैरान करने की बात तो यह है,"},{"instruction":"anyone looking for a freight forwarder?","output":"NO"},{"instruction":"What’s the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)?

R since it been there for long.Python is slowly gaining the popularity.These majority of people are users of the existing libraries ready for use through Python or R. Also, they said, users should also know C++, due to following reasons: The above said libraries in use by R or Python, are created in C++.If you need a new library that is not yet in the existing libraries, or some customization is required, then C++ is anyway needed. So, its good to have C++ knowledge too, otherwise you need that developer who knows C++ & partially ML. Since your interest is in C++, you should try to learn what is already there in Python or R, get into & study those libraries made in C++. In the future, you could be that C++ developer who develop/maintain those libraries. One last thing is to note that ML does not mean R or Python or C++, it is the functionality of those libraries have. So, learning ML is not depended on a particular language, though if the functionality in a library for a programming language you use already exists, it is easy to try it out/ learn, i.e. it eases learning ML.

My answer: I attended two strange conventions, as an officer and group counsel of the financial-planning firm Ameriprise Financial. I attended all-expenses-paid boondoggle (wasteful and impractical) trips to “conventions” (assemblies of company officers and directors for the common purpose of having fun) in Cancun, Mexico and Las Vegas, Nevada. In each case, we were flown to an exotic hotel, where we enjoyed a week of frivolity at the expense of shareholders. In Cancun, we stayed at an all-inclusive resort on the beach. At night, we were put on a bus that travelled through a very poor part of Cancun to a wealthy estate where, behind protective gates, we were entertained and encouraged to eat and drink as the ancient Romans did in their gluttonous and wasteful “vomitoriums” (where Romans would throw up lavish meals so they could return to the table and feast some more). During the Las Vegas boondoggle, we stayed at the lavish Venetian Resort and partied at night in the TAO Nightclub, where World class DJs, celebrities and female models immersed in rose petal baths entertained us with three bars, one dance floor, and a 40-foot outside terrace overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.

By thinking in English first, you don’t have to translate in your head, and this strategy can improve fluency. Also, when speaking English in your head, this helps you internalise the language. It means all you need is to speak without paying attention to the rules and pronunciations. Native people speak fluently and correctly by default because they have internalised the language. By thinking without translating, you will also speak English in a less-pressurised and more confident way. You don’t have to worry about whether you are pronouncing correctly or being understood by others. Another benefit of thinking in English is that it saves you time with relearning words and increases your vocabulary words that you will use in everyday conversations. You can learn to think in English by: 1. Start small, then go bigger You don’t have to start with ‘complete sentence level of English’. Instead, start smaller. Start at individual word level. For example, when you wake up in the morning, think of words like: bed, water, bathroom, toothbrush, breakfast, clothes, shoes. Just think of the single English words for everything you see, hear and do. From there, start thinking in short English sentences, then longer simple sentences. When you become better at English, you have a wider vocabulary and you will be able to use more complex-structure sentences to express your thought and emotion. 2. Think in English most of the time Read and write in English. Listen to English. Communicate in English. Convert everything that uses languages in your life to English, for example, your phone default language, etc. Even when you take notes, do it in English. Just use it in all the occasions you can get. Living in an English-speaking country like Australia and [LINKED_TEXT: studying English at Scots] [URL: http://www.scotsenglish.edu.au/courses] give you chance to think in English most of the time. 3. Speak with yourself, in your mind, in English Everyday, as a matter of routine, mentally talk to yourself about what you are doing, how you are feeling, describe to yourself whatever happened during the day. For example, when you walking: “There are jacaranda trees that in bloom on my way to school. They are gorgeous, even their name is fabulous. I am taking some photos now.” This helps you handle real-life situations in English later on. 4. Speak out loud to yourself Speaking out loud to yourself in English is a crucial step in learning to think in English. Isn’t that the way we learn our native language? Don’t worry about making mistakes. It’s much better to practise English by speaking and making mistakes than not to speaking in English because of the fear of making mistakes. Also, speaking aloud will help you find out where you need to improve and anchor English pronunciation into your long-term memory. 5. Get creative If you get stuck while thinking in English (i.e. don’t know how to say something in English), think of a way around the word. For example, if you’re trying to explain to someone that you lost your wallet, but can’t remember the word “wallet”, then you can tell them instead that “I lost the thing you use to carry cash and credit cards.” The sentence doesn’t use the word “wallet”, but it is clear enough to be understood. This also prevents conversation interruption by your pulling out a dictionary app. Some ways to describe a word you can’t remember are: “It’s something you use to...”, “It’s a place where...”, “It’s the same as/ similar to...”, “It’s the opposite of...”, It’s an action you do when...”. 6. Build your vocabulary There are times you can’t think of a word (or don’t know a word) in English, which leads you to get creative in #5. As soon as you can, note down the word ‘definition’ in English on a little book or a note app on your phone. At the end of the day, look up these words in English and write them down. You should use a monolingual dictionary (i.e. an English-English dictionary). By reading definitions in English and associating words with concepts rather than words in your native language, you will understand and use the words correctly. You can record new words using images. That way, when you are trying to remember the word, your brain will ‘see’ the picture and recall the English word automatically instead of your native word.

It can be very demoralizing to put so much effort into something, only to have the company’s leadership shut it down because they are not prepared to go outside their comfort zone. On the flip side, have you ever had the privilege to work for a company that embraced creativity, innovation, and unrealistic expectations? There is a reason why good companies become great, and the average companies remain average. Great leaders are prepared to push the limits of their industry while embracing innovative concepts and ideas. Leaders with an inspiring vision challenge their teams to leave their comfort zones by communicating optimism about future goals even though it may appear challenging. The world needs more Inspirational leaders who are not afraid to upset the status quo, but more importantly, leaders who are prepared to step outside their comfort zone to inspire the next generation of Inspirational leaders to believe in the impossible. Comfort zone is called a comfort zone for a reason – because you’ve used to do things there and you feel comfortable about it. But being in your comfort zone is not going to help you grow. When you stay in your comfort zone for a long time, it kills productivity and growth. One important benefit of stepping out of your comfort zone is that it can make you more resilient.

A measurement is meaningless if, after you get a value, you measure that quantity again as fast as you can and get a different answer. If you get the same answer, we have a stable measurement with a chance of being measured of 100%. Prior to making the first measurement, the wave function only gives us probabilities about what the quantity might be. After we measure, we have a 100% chance of getting the same result. A wave function is actually a weighted average of baseline wave functions. For example, the wave function might represent the electron having a 50% chance of being in the ground state and a 50% chance of being in the first excited state. The baseline wave functions depend on the system being measured. For example, an electron in a hydrogen atom can only have certain discrete energies each being E=(-13.6eV/N^2) for some positive integer N. Any time you measure the energy of the bounded electron, it’s going to be only one of those allowed values. It doesn’t matter how you measure it. So upon measurement, we know what the energy is, but do we know the position? We don’t. We know there’s a 100% chance the particle is in one of the baseline wave functions, the one corresponding to the electron having that energy. Specifically, the probability is roughly decays exponentially as you move away from the nucleus, so there’s a spread in space. While we have the wave function telling us where the particle is probabilistically, its Fourier Transform tells us the probability distribution of its momentum. The momentum also has baseline states. As it happens, to be in a one well defined energy state means we have a spread in space. To have a well defined position, we need to have a spread in momentum space. This happens however simple our system. For some physical observables, to be in one distinct baseline state necessarily means to be in at least two baseline state for the complementary variables:[LINKED_TEXT: Complementarity (physics) - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)] - Having a definite position means to be in a single baseline state for position.That necessarily means your momentum wave function is a combination of at least two baseline states for momentum. For a particle to be in a well defined state, it has to be in ONE baseline state for the given observable. But being in one position state means its in at least TWO (and usually many more) baseline states for the momentum. So you are guaranteed a spread."},{"instruction":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","output":"Lots of answers here, but nobody mentioned the fact that when your brakes go out and the pedal hits the floor, if you keep pushing a little harder, you will stop.

I recently found out that my dad is not my biological dad, but I have his last name and he's on my birth certificate. How did my mom get this all changed and am I able to get it changed back?","output":"That’s a tough one. Each state has its own, unique process for removing a non-biological father's name from the birth certificate. Your first step is to contact your state's Vital Records department to ask about the requirements. If you're unsure, you should consider hiring an attorney. In some states, like Michigan, you can complete an application to remove or replace a father on the birth record. To remove a name, you'll need to fill out the form and provide a copy of a court order (like your judgment of divorce), or a court determination of non-paternity. Other states require you to file a legal request through the court before you can modify the birth certificate. For example, California has a two-step process: First, you'll need to file a motion with the court and obtain a court order that allows you to remove the father's name. Within this first step, you'll need to prove paternity (or non-paternity.) Once you obtain a court order, you can submit the appropriate fee, the application to change the birth certificate (called the affidavit to amend a record), the court order, and a photocopy of the current birth certificate.

Dil Bechara is a movie that teaches you to be happy and spread happiness despite all the odds. A movie that is honest to it's core. Some scenes of the movie are emotional especially in the light of Sushant's death. According to me, it basically touches three basic pillars of our life. Happiness - It tells us that no matter what life throws at you, you can still be happy. We can find happiness in the little things we do. A scene towards the end of the movie, where Manny goes to see a Rajnikanth movie all by himself, just to make him happy, breaks your heart. Happiness is not having all the money in the world, but having a couple of friends who you know will be there right by your side till the end. Happiness is making your loved ones happy. Strength - The movie shows us how Manny, despite all the odds, stays strong till the end. How Manny, even though he is suffering from terminal illness, wants Kizie's dream to come true. The true nature of one's character comes out when confronted by adverse situations. We can draw strength from our loved ones. Friendship - Happiness is friendship. Everything we do doesn't nned to have a reason behind it. We see, how Manny and his friends wish to complete a movie, just because they want to. As we progress forward in the movie, we realise it's the journey of making the film at they really care about rather than the film. Little things give you happiness when you know how unpredictable life is. When you know how short your life is, it changes your perspective. The big things that we all dream and care about become pointless. You start seeing the people around you, feel their pain, make friends, enjoy little things. That is what the movie is all about, perspective. It tells us that all the things we fight about don't really matter in the end. We see, how Kizie and Manny care about an unfinished song and the lengths they go for it. Something, that we probably won't care about. The movie tells us to shed all our inhibitions and say and do everything we want to because life is very short and unpredictable. To sum it up, It's not a movie. It's an emotion.

But… to answer your question, from what I’ve observed, there’s a fundamental difference in attitude between Americans and Canadians towards trash. In Canada, even if the trash isn’t your own, there’s an impulse in a lot of Canadians to do something about it right away. ie. pick it up and dispose of it. Whereas in the USA, I’ve actually been walking with Americans who see trash and they might at most shake their heads in disgust and comment on how filthy the streets are…but they don’t do anything about it. Sort of a “It’s somebody else’s problem…” attitude. In these cases, when I give in to my Canadian instinct to pick it up, I invariably get the response of “Ewwww… what are you doing?” from my American friends. SO… if you’re an American, what are you going to do about the trash? Making America great starts with you.

You distinguish between the physical ships and the idea of the ship. I use the plural — physical ships — because each instant sees a different physical ship. But you can define as “the idea of the ship” the (partial) function that maps each point in time to the physical ship at that point in time. You can now define an equivalence relation between physical ships which says two physical ships s,s’ are equivalent if there are points in time t,t’ and an ideal ship S such that S(t) = s and S(t’) = s’. By restricting the set of ideal ships appropriately — e.g., having a fixed set of ideal ships, which are disjoint (in the sense that a physical ship is only in the codomain of a single ideal ship) — you get that this is really an equivalence relation. Then you introduce notation: we say two physical ships are the same if they are equivalent. Note that the decision whether the ship that is originally constructed and the ship where all parts are replaced are the same depends on your choice of the ideal ships, and it’s completely arbitrary. Really, it doesn’t matter much. But I’m not sure whether the point of the ship was really to create a problem that needs to be solved.

One of the classics of the anti-abortion crowd. That zygote is a person, therefore we can’t have abortion. The arguments against personhood of zygotes are that a zygote can’t think or make any choices for itself, can’t live independently, is literally just a single cell, and a whole host of other things have to happen to a zygote before it even has a chance of growing in the correct ways to one day become a fetus and then be born as a human infant. For example, approximately half of all zygotes don’t properly implant in the uterine wall. That’s a whole lot of people that never had a chance in life! The arguments for personhood are basically that a zygote will one day become a person, so we need to retroactively grant it personhood rights. This relies on a kind of Back to the Future logic where people think “I wouldn’t want to have been aborted, therefore I must protect the rights of other future humans that I assume will all feel as I do!” It’s perhaps not quite as ridiculous as I make it sound here, but it’s at heart an emotional argument. The fact that conception is chosen as the moment a person exists and life becomes sacred is almost certainly a holdover from religion too. There’s nothing particularly special about conception that separates it from the processes before it and the processes after it that are just as necessary for a new life to happen. But guess what? The personhood debate is actually a red herring in the abortion debate! It’s an emotional trick to make people think that an abortion is murder of another person. Let’s forget the unborn for a second and just talk about personhood rights. What are they? I’m a person after all. There’s no debate about that. I’m a 39 year old adult for crying out loud! No one can deny that I’m a person. Now tell me: do I have a right to your body? I mean, let’s say that I have a rare kidney disease and need your kidneys to live. Are you required to let me hook my body up yours so that your kidneys can filter my blood of toxins as well as your own? No, of course not! That’s preposterous. Your body is your own, and you can choose what to do with it. What if you were literally the only kidney match out there for me? Without your kidneys, I will die. A person will die. Does that give me the right to your kidneys? Of course not. You have bodily autonomy and my disease gives me no right to take your choice away from you. Lastly let’s say that all of the above is true, but during the night I sneak into your house and hook myself up to your kidneys. It’s unethical, and even against the law, but it’s done now. You wake up, and I’m hooked up to your kidneys. Do you have the right to detach me? Detaching me is as good as killing me. I require your kidneys to live. It’s no longer the case that you’re just declining to save my life, instead you’re needing to take an active role in ending my life. And remember, no one can argue that I’m not a person. The answer is obvious here: of course you can detach me. I’m a person, but so are you, and you have a right to your own body as I do. Personhood grants no special right to another’s body, even if you require their body to live. This thought experiment gives the lie to the personhood debate as it happens in the abortion debate. Anti-abortion activists assert that a fetus is a person and has rights, but they’re trying to give the fetus rights that a person doesn’t have! They’re saying “that fetus is a person, therefore it has a right to its mother’s body”, but personhood has never conferred a right to the body of another person, as we just saw when you disconnected me from your kidneys. Personhood just doesn’t matter to this debate. It doesn’t give you the right to live off of someone else’s body. Every person you know has personhood, and it should be obvious that we all have no right to other people’s bodies."},{"instruction":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","output":"I took my daughter to breakfast at a (now defunct) Friendly’s.

What is the reason?","output":"Q: Why does the Persian calendar start at 622 CE? What is the reason? Thank you for your question. I assume that you refer to the current civil calendar of Iran which is, actually, rooted in a combination of pre-Islamic Persian and Islamic traditions of time measurement. The things like its names of the months or its solar-year orientation are among its pre-Islamic Persian features while the things like its seven-day weeks or the calendar era which it uses are among its Islamic features. So, its calendar era starts with the year which corresponds to 622 CE because it is the year when Muhammad presumably left Mecca for the city of Yathrib, nowadays known as Medina, i. e. the year of the Muslim Hijrah (“Departure” in Arabic). It has an exclusively Islamic significance, there is no other reason for that year which would came from the Persian culture itself. The pre-Islamic Persian calendar system obviously did not use that calendar era. In reality, the pre-Islamic Persian imperial tradition even identified years according to a completely different system of successive regnal eras, each era starting with the year when a new Mazdaic monarch ascended the Iranian throne. It means that, for example, the year when shahanshah Bahram V ascended the throne was the 1st year of Bahram V’s era, then the 2nd year of Bahram V’s era followed and so on until Bahram V died and the throne was ascended by his son Yazdegerd II which closed the Bahram V’s era since the year of his coronation became the 1st year of Yazdegerd II’s era, etc. The historical accounts in the pre-Islamic Persia therefore could be formulated in a way like “Hear what happened during the 5th year of the reign of Bahram V…”. Essentially a very comparable calendar system of successive regnal eras is used by the Japanese civil calendar (which has currently the 2nd year of Reiwa Era which started when the current emperor Naruhito ascended the throne in 2019 CE after the abdication of his father Akihito which ended the previous Heisei Era) even today. Depiction of Bahram V fighting Karg, the mythical unicornous wolf In contrast to Japan, the advent of Islam largely displaced the pre-Islamic Persian (specifically Sassanid) calendar system, though not completely and the Mazdaic minorities even continued to fully use varieties of the old calendar until this day. But the peculiarity of the current post-Islamic Zoroastrian year counting is that we kind of became frozen in the Yazdegerd III’s era. Yazdegerd III was the last Mazdaic monarch who ascended the Iranian throne before the Islamic invasion and the Zoroastrian people historically never subjectively recognized any of the later Muslim leaders and governments as legitimate successors, so Yazdegerd III is officially still seen as the last legitimate ruler of Iran with the throne so far being vacant ever since (so we have currently the year 1389 of Yazdegerd’s Era) according to the Zoroastrian calendar Fasli. However, some modern Zoroastrians are not fond of this year counting anymore because the outsiders do not understand that the current year number represents just the years from the coronation of the last Mazdaic monarch, which are preceded by the years of the eras of previous monarchs, and not the years from the beginning of our history, so it makes a wrong impression like if our history was quite short. Zoroastrian calendar (or rather calendars as there are three different versions nowadays, originally due to historical differences in (non)implementation of intercalary periods after the post-Islamic dispersion of Zoroastrian communities) also still preserves, apart of the traditional names of the months which were incorporated even into the civil calendar of Iran, also the old Persian day naming system with 30 regular days each of a different name, plus the intercalary days at the end of the year, which corresponds to the fact that the Zoroastrian calendar still does not use the week system of successive cycles of just seven repeating days. Similarly like in the case of the names of the months, also the days are named after deities and animistically perceived aspects of the world in the Zoroastrian tradition, and the names of the more important holy forces after whom the 12 months are named have also counterparts in the names of the days. When the name of the day meets the name of the respective month, there is traditionally a religious festivity dedicated to the holy being after which the day and the month were named, i. e. for example on the day of Mehr (archaically Mithra) of the month Mehr, there is the festivity of Mehragan (archaically Mithrakana) dedicated to divine Mehr (Mithra).

In getting rid of the nuisance of electronic waste by dumping them in African countries, the developed and industrialized countries are harvesting the proverbial whirlwind in return and in astounding measure too! How a youngster in one West African country managed to obtain sensitive personal information about one-time United States Republican Congressman, Robert Wexler, and tried to blackmail him from thousands of miles away, remains a puzzle to date The youngster called Wexler from the capital city of this West African country and told the US congressman that he had Wexler’s Social Security number and other information and threatened to turn the data over to identity theft specialists if Wexler did not pay him. Wexler reported the matter to the United States Capitol Police who contacted the Police in this African country, and the suspect was traced and arrested for attempting to extort money and for identity theft. Before the suspect’s arrest, unidentified persons had made unauthorized attempts to gain access to Wexler’s personal bank account and to use his credit cards. It was later established that the suspect had managed to obtain personal information about other prominent US citizens apart from Wexler. I reported fairly elaborately on the activities of an international team of investigators who travelled to the West African country in June 2009, to investigate the dumping of e-waste in a suburb of the national capital which had attained international fame as one of the world’s largest e-waste dumping sites. The country is the second most Internet fraud-prone country in Africa and the seventh most cybercrime-prone country in the world according to rankings of The Global Internet Report. The team of investigators established a link between the dumping of junk computers in that country, and the epidemic of Internet fraud in the country. After the team went shopping for computer hard drives in electronic spare parts shops in the city and analyzed files on them, the rest of the pieces in the puzzle began to fall into place. A hard drive from a discarded computer purchased at the local currency equivalent of about one dollar by the team, was found to contain confidential and sensitive details of a US 22 million dollar contract between the government of the United States and Northrop Grumman, one of the largest military contractors in the US and manufacturers of the famed Grumman Tomcat war planes. The hard drive was also found to contain defence and security contracts involving the US Defense Intelligence Agency, NASA and the US Homeland Security. Other hard drives purchased by the team were found to contain intimate details of people's lives. The files also contained private financial data including credit card numbers, account information and records of online transactions undertaken by the original owners. Three universities, Longwood University in the US, Glamorgan University in Cardiff, UK and Edith Cowan University in Western Australia, have tested applications and tools that are available from the internet and which can be used by anyone with simple knowledge of computers to recover data left on hard drives by the original owners. In the course of their study, technicians from the uniersities discovered sensitive details of a US military missile air defence system located on a second-hand hard drive bought on an online auction site. The data related to test launch procedures for Terminal High Altitude Area Defence ground to air missile defence systems. The technicians managed to recover hundreds of hard disks containing bank account details, personal medical records, confidential business plans, financial and accounting company data and personal PIN numbers. Back to the question: James Durie, a former FBI agent, suggested the physical destruction of data on hard drives to prevent their use for cybercrimes. Global Environmental Services, an NGO, has insisted that smashing a hard drive with a hammer will not destroy data from a discarded computer because digitally encoded data resides deep within the drive on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. There are those who claim that the only one way to completely erase files on a hard drive is to destroy the magnetic platters inside the drive. To be able to do this, you need to use a T7 screwdriver to remove as many screws as you can access, until you are probably able to remove the main circuit board from the enclosure. Global Environmental Services once said the only sure way to get rid of the data on a hard drive is to sanitize it with software that makes multiple passes or to completely grind it up, as taking a hammer to a hard drive or shooting it with a nail gun, will not keep data out of the hands of cyber criminals or terrorist groups."},{"instruction":"Who were massacred at the Easter banquet hosted by Vlad Dracula? Why and how?","output":"Vlad Dracula had a serious problem. Even though he had just taken the throne of Wallachia in September of 1456, he saw his power weakening just a couple of years later. Who caused that? The boyar, or noblemen of Wallachia. Romanian boyars at the end of the 18th century Boyar were basically landowning nobility who made a *very nice* living through managing peasant villages, levying rents and taxes. Some boyar owned dozens or even hundreds of villages. Thus, they were quite wealthy. Think the millionaires of Medieval Wallachia. With all that money comes political power. For all intents and purposes, they made up their own “Shadow Ruling Class”. Now, technically, Vlad was Prince of Wallachia but unfortunately, the nobles were beginning to see the position of domn or Lord as more of a “figurehead” whilst they preferred to make the real decisions behind the scenes. Vlad did not like that. He was an authoritative man and a monarchist who wished to remain autonomous in his rule and decision making. On top of this, he also fancied the idea that the boyar were responsible for killing his elder brother. All these factors fed into the major disagreement that developed between Vlad and the boyar. Contrary to opinion, politics and power entirely motivated this disagreement — it had nothing to do with the concept of “revenge”. Nonetheless, the heat was on. Ol’ Vlad realized he had to do something as the boyars were gaining steam. He had only been voivode for about 3 and a half years. He didn’t want to lose it — but he had to be careful. On one hand, Vlad was technically also a nobleman. The boyar and Vlad were of the same class and they had the same motivations. However, the relationship was parasitic in that Vlad could not remain Prince without their agreement. This was the particular crossroads Vlad found himself wavering at. Although Vlad could not get rid of the boyar class completely, he needed assurances they would not rise against him. To kill all the boyars would have meant killing his own supporters and financial backers, as well as committing genocide against his own class (Cazacu, 2017). This could not happen — but that did not mean he couldn’t weed out those individuals who were plotting a revolution against him and his rule. If he left the boyar to their own devices, they would absolutely rise up, poisoning his allies against him before eventually assassinating him. He had to find a way to live and keep his power while also maintaining the “good” boyars who agreed with him and his policies. One brisk afternoon in March of 1459, Vlad enacted a top secret plan to do just that. This Easter meal took place on a Friday, ahead of Easter sunday. A banquet was held that afternoon in the throne hall at the Princely Palace of Targoviste to commemorate the occasion. In attendance was Vlad Dracula himself and a whole host of boyars. Each nobleman was responsible for bringing a share of food and a form of entertainment. This could have been a musician, a puppet show, or other things. Orthodox Easter was a very important holiday in Wallachia, being one of the largest celebrations of the year, second only to Christmas. Thus, the Easter festivities began. People ate various roast meats and desserts. Music played in the background, probably a mix of Turkish inspired and Byzantine inspired jigs. Note: Byzantine culture was extremely popular in Vlad’s time. The Romanian nobility imported their music, customs, and clothing in order to appear “refined” and “upperclass”. After the men had eaten and drank heartily, Vlad spoke up with glass in hand, and asked all those boyar men seated before him one specific question; How many lords have each of you seen in your time at court? This question greatly concerned the boyars, and for good reason. Whenever a Prince disagreed with the boyar or vice versa, the boyar simply had the man deposed or killed, so they could support another. Vlad knew this and he had good reason to suspect that they were planning to do this to him. He sat, silently scanning the room, awaiting their answers. Slowly but surely, one nobleman spoke up, then two. One claimed to have seen 50 princes, while another said 10 and another 15, and so on. Their answers just confirmed what he had already suspected, sealing their fates. When they’d finished answering, Vlad Dracula had his own accusation. A medieval artist by the name of Michael Beheim sings about it in a ballad he composed about Dracula in 1463; When this question was fully answered Dracula said: “Tell me, how is it that you have had so many rulers and lords in your domain? The cause for this disgrace must be your own shameful defiance! Now it did not matter what the boyars actually said. I remind you, Vlad planned this in advance. No matter what the boyars had said, they would have died, regardless — and they did just that. Vlad had them all seized and specific individuals were immediately put to death by impalement. As with all things pertaining to Dracula, however, the numbers of those actually killed have been exaggerated over the centuries. We know due to court records and the annual sfantul domn/Princely Council document (a registrar of every boyar at court) that he did not kill all of his boyars. Moreover, the hall at the Princely Palace of Targoviste is not very large at all. Experts agree that only about 50 men in total could have attended such a gathering in the first place. The ruins of The Princely Palace at Targoviste Given all this, we can safely say Vlad realistically killed about 40 boyar. Still this would have been a great shock to the Wallachian people and certainly to the boyar families, but 40 is nowhere near the previously reported “hundreds” or even “thousands”. While Vlad never bothered to create a list of the executed, we do know of some of the men he killed that day. Notably a vornic (deputy) named Codrea, who upon his death left behind a bank account in Sibiu worth 3,000 gold ducats which was seized by Matthias Corvinus. Then there was an older boyar named Manea (son of Udriște), his properties in Prahova and Dâmboviţa being confiscated soon after. On that Easter Day he also exterminated an entire unnamed boyar clan. Of 22 people listed in Vlad’s various council documents, 11 disappear after 1459. All this added up to about 40–50 men on stakes but no more than that. After they’d been impaled, Vlad took their possessions and money. Redistributing them to lower-class men, who he intended to raise up as “new boyar” who would only be loyal to him. Most of these men were Serbian, Tatar, and Turkish. Vlad thus surrounded himself with trusted men from all spheres, even Turks and Tatars. His court must have resembled that of the Ottoman Sultans, where the languages spoken were notably Slavic, Greek, and last of all … Turkish! “Dracula” by Matei Cazacu (2017) It is largely thought that Dracula was attempting to mimic the Ottoman Sultan by exterminating the dissidents in his court and filling it with foreign intellectuals and loyal peasant-class servants — and I agree. After this entire ordeal was over, the dead boyar’s wives and children were marched to the site of Castle Poenari, which was a ruin at the time. They formed a human chain up the mountainside, helping to transport materials for the construction of the castle. Vlad’s men whipped anyone caught slacking. Very few survived to see the work finished. Best, A. If you liked this answer and want to keep reading; [LINKED_TEXT: Abbagail Marie Dionisie · Jan 7Was Vlad Dracula ungrateful to the Ottomans that spared his life and raised him?Oh buddy. Was Vlad Dracula ungrateful? Hm. Let’s see. Considering that Dracula was brought to Tokat Castle, a place commonly used as janissary barrack and prison (and residence), I assume not. In fact they excavated one cell where he was kept prisoner a couple years ago. Let’s look, shall we? Mmmm. Cozy. Keeping in mind those cells were kept in the dungeon/basement area, hence why they were so well preserved. Sure, technically they did educate him and his brother in Turkish and Turkish warfare. Vlad was 12 when he came to the Ottoman Empire, just 4 years shy of being an adult, so they did not “raise him” and he already had an extensive European/Christian education. But they didn’t offer Vlad an education and food because the Turks “loved him”, and it wasn’t “optional”, either. It was indoctrination. Sultan Murad (Sultan Mehmed’s father) never planned on letting Dracula go. They only did that when his father was unexpectedly assassinated on the orders of Janos Hunyadi and they felt they had no other choice. Vlad was “educated” in a sense (the bare minimum, he did not receive a sultan’s education) because the Ottomans were notorious for kidnapping Christian boys (who they could freely enslave, because they weren’t Muslim). They then brainwashed them through a series of beatings, starvation, and indoctrination in the form of an all Turkish, all Muslim education. If you’re curious, I recommend picking up a book on the Janissary or devshirme practices in The Ottoman Empire. Once sufficiently mentally stripped, the boys would be set up as commanders/governors/mayors around the empire, with loyalty only to the Sultan (because they were ripped away from their families, brainwashed, and were totally dependent on his mercy, remember?) Vlad had a dual purpose. He doubled as leverage against the Wallachians, which is also why they kept him and Radu alive. See, you don’t know that because you’ve only watched one show on Netflix, which was highly edited and twisted to fit a pro-Ottoman narrative. A form of nationalist propaganda and indoctrination. The same as in Vlad’s day - but now on TV. I don’t blame you. I myself enjoyed the show, though it’s not accurate. So as one Netflix lover to another, I’ll do you one better. I’ll source my answer at the bottom so you can research yourself. So no, I don’t believe Vlad would be “grateful”. He was beaten mercilessly and kept in a cell when he misbehaved. He was also sexually abused. I’ll stop short of sodom - but those with a historical education who know, know. Also I can imagine that he was not grateful to the Sultan for mercilessly pursuing and forcing himself sexually onto his younger brother, Radu, who was only 10 at the time. I’ve got a little treat. I spent my time flipping through my history books and translations and found the text from Laonikos Chalkokondyles (Mahmud Pasha’s friend and confidant) who details this relationship; The sultan spent that winter in his palace and summoned Vlad [III], the son of [Vlad II] Dracul and ruler of Wallachia, as he already had his younger brother [Radu III] at the court, keeping him as his lover and maintaining him. It happened that the sultan was almost killed by the boy when he had wanted to have sex with him. This was when he had ﬁrst gained the throne and was preparing to campaign against Karaman. He was in love with the boy and invited him for conversation, and then as a sign of his respect he invited him for drinks to his bedchamber. The boy did not expect to suffer such a thing from the sultan, and when he saw the sultan approaching him with that intention, he fought him off and refused to consent to intercourse With him. The sultan kissed the unwilling boy, who drew a dagger and struck the sultan on his thigh. He then ﬂed in whatever direction he could ﬁnd. The doctors were able to treat the sultan’s wound. The boy had climbed up a tree there and was hiding. When the sultan packed up and left, the boy came down from the tree, began his journey, and, shortly afterward, arrived at the Porte and became the sultan’s lover. The sultan was used to having relations no less with those who shared his own inclinations (homosexual urges for young boys). “The Histories” 1465 by LAONIKOS CHALKOKONDYLES (Translated and published by Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library) I also imagine Vlad heard the stories of the Serbian Brankovic brothers who found themselves in a similar situation (captured as young boy hostages, sent to live at Edirne) but were blinded with hot pokers by the Turk before they had even turned 18. Living day in and out, fearing that same fate for himself. No. Grateful had nothing to do with it — and that showed in Vlad’s attitude, who resented the Turks. By all means, sure, let’s enjoy the fantasy and continue to pretend he grew up in a Turkish Hilton suite alongside his “best buddy” Sultan Mehmed ← That’s a lie too, by the way. Mehmed lived on the other side of Anatolia when Vlad and Radu were brought as hostages to the Ottoman Empire.
