She was twirling on the office chair while thinking about something, at first I neglected it and thought that she was in her own world thinking about her office. Then she took the paper weight ball in her hand from the table and started spinning it, this time out of curiosity I asked her the reason behind her uneasiness. She- Akshu, today I received a call from my friend, she said to me that one of her relative was admitted to a superspeciality hospital in Mumbai. Me- So? It’s nice right, that she’ll receive a good treatment. She- Ya but it happened when her condition started to deteriorate because they were short on money to admit her. Me- Oh sad so Didi helped her right? But short on money how? She- Her husband lost his job due to the ongoing crisis and her kids required her special attention as they were in standard 12th! Also she took a job in a company to bear the expenses of home. Post the discussion, I asked the office helper and security to lock the office and we started our drive back home. We reached home and went to our respective rooms. While combing my hairs a thought struck my mind regarding how important money is in life. Money can’t buy happiness? Why to run behind money? Money minded people? Some People say that money doesn’t mater in life, if it is so then what matters?

I started with a Prius Plug-In Hybrid. It only had a batter range of about 12 miles, but many of my errands were well less than 12 miles. But, I’d always return home with at least 6 miles still on the battery. If I accelerated a little too fast, or turned on the heat or the A/C, the gas engine would kick in. Thus, I’d be using gas even though I had plenty of battery for my entire trip. I got frustrated and started thinking of a solution of how I could drive an EV without a gas engine kicking in. It was obvious. Buy an EV with no gas engine at all and the gas engine would never kick in. Hence I sold my 2012 Plug-In Prius and purchased a 2013 Tesla Model S 85. I was happy with it, but it had very few features, not even proximity alerts. So I traded that in for a 2015 Tesla Model S P85DL and still have that car now with 50,000 miles. Also in 2014 we ordered a Tesla Model X P90DL for my wife which wasn’t delivered until a couple of years later. We also still own that vehicles with 40,000 miles and are extremely happy with it even though it was an early production model (#256) with all the early problems. Tesla resolved all those problems for free and we may keep this car forever. I think a lot of Tesla owners, especially from the early years, may have previously owned a hybrid and graduated to a Tesla when they realized they really don’t need a gasoline engine to have an acceptable driving range."},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"High protein vegetarian food options in Indian cuisine people who go to the gym to bulk up while also losing fat.

Let’s call her S to make it easier. When S was a teenager she slammed her bedroom door twice…the first time she got told that if she did it again, her door would be removed. A couple of days later S slams the door again. The next day she comes back from school and her door wasn’t there… She obviously got angry at her parents and started asking to get her door back and how unfair it was that they’d removed it. Mom and dad told her that she’d been warned, and that the door would only come back on once she was able to talk things through and not slam doors or walk out of the room. The door eventually came back on with a bigger dose of respect and improved communication. At some point she wouldn’t come to eat dinner because she was “in the middle of a game” after a few warnings and such, she ended up not having dinner at the appointed time. Her parents ended up not making a fuss, but when she got home from school and attempted to resume playing, she found all her games were there, except for the one she’d been playing the night before. When S asked her mom about it, she said she’d removed the reason for her not eating dinner with the rest of the family, hoping she’d be able to make it tonight. Once again S couldn’t really complain, so she ended up learning to prioritize family dinner over her games. But the one I liked the most, was the “I don’t have anything to wear for the party on Friday”. After complaining for a few days and her mom suggesting tons of different outfits she could wear, she came home to a pair of jeans, a couple of T-shirts, a few pairs of socks as well as a jacket and a pair of shoes. When she opened her closet door, she really had “nothing to wear”. In this instance her mom made a point of showing her that “nothing to wear” and nothing to wear isn’t the same.

Their origin goes back to Iranians (Persians) and Kurds.” Now I just paste that answer. This is complete bullshit of Persian propoganda in order to calm down Azerbaijan Turks and other Turkich nations inside. It is bullshit because in the 1-st: language is so strong characteristics that it can’t vanish neither in 1 day, no in 1–2–3… centuries. Say, Yakuts , Chechens, Tatarians or Azerbaijan Turks have been for long time inside Russian empire but they preserved their languages despite some mixed marriages. Languages don’t evaporate during a few centuries and can’t be easily forgotten or changed because are given to children from parents inside family despite the official state language. “Turkification” as well “Russification” are myths of not clever scientists. I think not less than 3–5 thousand years are necessary for full change of a language of 1 big nation ( such as Azerbaijanian Turks, around 35 millions in total) and also brutal control and forcing not to talk in the native about which we never heard in the history. Yes, nations may disappear but not their languages ( e.g. latin). In the 2-nd, it is bullshit, because haplogroup ( genetics on the level of DNA) of Azerbaijanians despite it is mixed is closer with autochthonous Caucasians and Turks of Turkey and mainly is J2 than J1 or Q of Iranian group of nations ( Persians, Kurds and others.)."},{"instruction":"Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?","output":"For standard symmetric key algorithms, encryption and decryption have about the same complexity.

It is commonly built in two configurations - Foam based and Spring based. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. As a thumb rule, springs having diameter in the range of 1.3-1.7 mm (14 to 16-gauge) make up for a high quality mattress which provides the best balance between firmness and cushioning and provides the best support to the body.Whereas, the springs having diameters above 1.7 mm (12 gauge) make the mattress too firm and it no longer remains supportive or comfortable. Whereas, Foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or other who prefer body hugging comfort. On the other hand, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should decide on according to the dimensions of the bed and awareness about the ways by which some brands cut manufacturing costs and produce low-grade mattresses which cause several neck and spine issues too play influential roles in determining the product one should opt for. I gained in-depth knowledge about them from the post - [LINKED_TEXT: Vibhor Shergill's answer to The extensive guide to purchasing a new Mattress.] [URL: https://shoppinaire.quora.com/The-extensive-guide-to-purchasing-a-new-Mattress] So, today, i.e., 18th August, 2021, at 2:57 PM, I placed the order for my mattress, keeping the insights gained in consideration.

However, unknowingly there are a few mistakes that everyone does: 1.A lot of students will not even think of making a time table, which impacts time management. They will just give long hours/days and be stuck on one topic and later get in to trouble when the exam is near and the topics are still uncovered. 2.A lot of students think that if they will get too many books it will contribute to their preparation.

Lundstrom. The Japanese simply couldn’t remove him because of their belief on the impact on the Japanese people. The removal of Nagumo would have been a signal of an enormous loss at Midway when the people were given the assumption Midway was a victory. And as explained by others posting here, his decisions were not overwhelmingly bad. He was hamstrung as an operational admiral by decisions by Yamamoto, and did what he could given his limitations. The failure at Midway went deep into the philosophy of the IJN and the military in general, in which all out attack was their mode. The stalemate in the Coral Sea which contributed to the loss of the Shokaku and the Zuikaku for the operation meant they loss operational effectiveness by a third.

Cosmic rays, solar radiation, carbon/potassium/uranium/thorium/radium/… decaying. Any planet/moon without a magnetosphere / ozone layer gets a LOT of radiation. A nuclear weapon produces a lot of extra radiation for a few years, after that its measurable, but not substantially more dangerous than radiation that already is hitting that area. Cosmic rays are particularly dangerous on the moon/mars. High energy protons/betas, that have both penetrating capability and the power to do damage (the worst of gamma radiation combined with the worst of alpha radiation). On earth cosmic rays decay to muons, loosing a lot of their energy. Our bodies can handle muons just fine (otherwise we’d get cancer just from being outside at night frequently). Anyhow that assumes cancers are caused by single DNA damage to a single cell, which is proven to be false. Living things have radiation repair mechanisms. It takes repeated punishment and a failure in such mechanisms for cancer to occur. Nuclear weapons are dangerous to living things. For planets / moons devoid of life, they might leave a crater, or transform dust into glass. That’s all. Jupiter is a gas giant, if a nuke is thrown at the Jovian atmosphere if its not set to detonate at ultra high altitudes, the massive pressure buildup will likely destroy the ignition circuits and deform the core so it will fizzle/fail to detonate. The massive atmosphere and strong wings will dilute the radiation and in a few hours the radiation will be hard to measure. The Venus atmosphere would also corrode and try to crush the nuclear weapon as well. Likely would fizzle / fail to detonate."},{"instruction":"What are the best color of loafers to buy that go with almost everything (jeans, chinos)?","output":"Since you mention jeans, chinos, I’m assuming you are primarily looking at casual outfits.

Should I let him?","output":"My 3-year-old insists on sleeping on the floor. Should I let him? Assuming the floor is relatively clean, there’s nothing wrong with that. As a kid I had a bed, but often napped on the floor in the sunshine (my bedroom was on the side of the house without sunshine). In college I continued that, I normally slept on the bed in my dorm room, but generally if I took a nap with a migraine, the concrete floor with a thin carpet was more comfortable. After college when I moved into my own apartment my parents didn’t initially have room in the car to pack my old bed, so I temporarily slept on the floor, for 10 years. If I visited others’ houses, or stayed in a hotel, I found beds with bedsprings to be uncomfortably soft and hard to sleep on. When I lived in India for a decade I always slept on a bed, but the beds were generally harder, and had no bedsprings, just a mattress on top of plywood. And the floors in all my flats were hard tiles with no carpets or rugs. Here in New York City, I slept on the floor for the first few years, using a sleeping bag on the hardwood floor. Then my wife got her green card and flew over, and we set up a nest of blankets on the floor as a bed. I liked it, she hated it. She used inflatable mattresses off and on, but none had a long life before leaking. Now we have a bed that was given to us. She likes it, I don’t. Most of the time I sleep on the living room floor so that she can watch TV in bed without disturbing me, since we have very different waking hours. I use a CPAP machine which records the number of breathing “events” I have every night (an “event” being a bad thing, the fewer the healthier). When I sleep on the bed there’re about double the number of events that I have when I sleep on the floor. So I guess the more firm floor is better for my health than the softer bed. I get fewer back aches, too, when I sleep on the harder floor."},{"instruction":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","output":"I would say the People of Ukraine and especially president Zelenskyy.

I haven’t gone through all the 100+ answers to this question but I am sure the perspective which I intend to present isn’t a popular one. The stigma attached to beard in a country like Pakistan is quite real. Pakistan has been toiling with terrorism for a couple of decades now. It is true that there are legitimate flaws/factors in the society which contributed to the proliferation of terrorism in this region.After 9/11 , more specifically , dynamics of Pakistani society has experienced a huge change which has led to a dichotomous bifurcation in the society. The bifurcation is more like an ideological one and both the sides consist of self righteous people who don’t flinch a little while dismissing any moderate idea which could be detrimental for their cult following . Anyways, my adolescence decided to hit me like a train in the timeline which perfectly aligned with the post 9/11 shenanigans of the world. As happens with the most boys (some girls too ) , that puberty announces its arrival in the form of facial hair. As fate would have it , my beard decided to show up earlier than boys of my age. On top of that I decided to keep my beard for strictly religious/domestic reasons. I still remember that the principal of our school, who was a nice lady in general, asked me to shave my beard on the grounds that it (i-e ‘my’ beard) would be uncomfortable for the girls in my class. Needless to say it was a blow to the self-esteem of my teen self who happened to be a shy individual. After sometime , I come to empathize with the principal as she had a strong army background and it was an era where keeping a beard was analogous to sympathizers of Taliban. Even until now I am judged by my beard which of course is nothing in comparison to the aforementioned episode. I am glad beards are in fashion now and this trend has alleviated situations similar to mine to a great extent. PS : I am sure most of the guys who grew their beards right after 9/11 experienced hostility which had some impact on their lives, I would love to hear from them."},{"instruction":"w many countries have you travelled to and which are they?","output":"I’ve been to 10 countries.

Syria Has a very rich and ancient history that is not well known in the world. One of the most ancient countries in the world. Bulgaria Bulgarians think everyone is against them and they have the oldest civilization in the world. In recent years, they think almost everyone has Bulgarian ancestry. Vasco da Gama might have Bulgarian ancestry for all we know. One of many treasures found in Bulgaria.

There was a slight 10kn left NW cross wind which the pilot allowed for. To land right on the threshold at the right speed unpowered allowing for crosswind takes skill. But back to your question. Try using a mobile phone to navigate then use a map and dead reckoning. An autopilot frees up a pilot to do other work in the cockpit.

Keep in mind that while there are free VPN options available, they may have limitations on speed, data usage, and security. If you're looking for a reliable and secure VPN, consider investing in a reputable paid service. Here's how you can set up a basic VPN using a free option like OpenVPN: Step 1: Choose a VPN Protocol OpenVPN is a widely used open-source VPN protocol. You'll need to choose between using a VPN service provider or setting up your own VPN server using OpenVPN software. Step 2: Set Up a VPN Server (Optional) If you want to set up your own VPN server, you can follow these general steps: 1. Select a Server: Choose a server where you want to host your VPN. This could be a cloud server or a computer at your home. 2. Install OpenVPN: Install the OpenVPN software on the server. You can find installation instructions on the OpenVPN website. 3. Configure OpenVPN: Configure OpenVPN by creating a configuration file. This file will include settings like encryption, authentication, and network settings. 4. Generate Certificates: Generate SSL certificates for secure communication between the server and clients. 5. Firewall and Routing: Configure firewall rules and routing on the server to allow VPN traffic. 6. Start OpenVPN Server: Start the OpenVPN server software. Step 3: Set Up OpenVPN Client on Your PC 1. Download OpenVPN Client: Download and install the OpenVPN client software on your PC from the official OpenVPN website. 2. Download Configuration Files: If you're using a VPN service provider, they will typically provide you with configuration files. If you've set up your own server, you'll need to transfer the configuration file you created earlier to your PC. 3. Import Configuration: Open the OpenVPN client and import the configuration file you downloaded or transferred. This will include details like server address, port, encryption settings, and more. 4. Connect: Once the configuration is imported, you can click the connect button to establish a VPN connection to the server. Step 4: Test and Troubleshoot After connecting, test your VPN connection to ensure it's working as expected. Make sure you can access websites and resources securely through the VPN. Remember, setting up a VPN server and configuring clients can involve technical challenges, and the steps can vary based on the operating systems you're using (Windows, Linux, macOS). If you're not comfortable with the technical aspects, you might want to consider using a user-friendly VPN service that offers client software and support."},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"This is my favourite quote and most apt one for the above question.

Aquatic life that are so rich in swampland that dries out in the summer get populated by mosquito larvae within days of the return of water. This provides food for other creatures in what would be the water’s equivalent of a desert concerning life. An entire food chain quickly moves in to the rich environment because of the near instant source of food for the smallest in the food chain. Mosquito larvae is key food source for fish, amphibians, other aquatic insect larvae, small reptiles, etc. As winged adults birds, bats, and other insect eaters that don’t fly get a rich source of food. Then everything that eats any of these aquatic or terrestrial species would also be affected. Basically entire ecosystems would have to readjust with many losers, and virtually no winners."},{"instruction":"Why is computer engineering not growing as fast as computer science?","output":"Because computer engineering is extremely difficult, especially when it comes to the basic level design. (This might be more EE than CompE). A CPU is made of many many many transistors. Each transistor is its own unit and therefore carries a possibility of failure during production. Even a 99.999% success rate means a pretty darn big overall failure rate with a billion transistors. In order to counter this problem, we can design better manufacturing techniques and better design techniques for the CPU so that there are many redundant features to reduce the risk of systematic failure. (So the system wont be messed up due to one failed transistor.) Based on my experience in fabrication and some knowledge of Computer engineering, I know the process of developing smart failure proof design and smart fabrication techniques is really resource consuming, both in material and time. Furthermore, we are approaching a bottleneck in transistor design in both size and performance. There is a limit to how small a transistor can be before “quantum weirdness” happens and before we reach theoretical peak performance. A lot of Computer Science is based more or less on mathematics and thinking how to think. For example, a person can easily count how many circles are on a page intuitively, yet is is pretty damn hard for a computer to do. We could apply our thinking methods and use that as an algorithm. This is a more hardware based answer, so it is best if you read more about system based answers too."},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"Sure!

Three southeastern African countries border the Indian Ocean – Tanzania , Mozambique , and South Africa . Other inland countries also experience the effects of tropical cyclones , including Botswana , Eswatini , Lesotho , Malawi , Namibia , Zambia , and Zimbabwe . February 15, 1950 - After crossing Madagascar, a cyclone struck eastern Mozambique and moved across much of Africa, eventually reaching northern Namibia . [2] [3] April 15, 1952 - A cyclone moved ashore southeastern Tanzania near Lindi with maximum sustained winds estimated at 180 km/h (110 mph); this made the cyclone the strongest on record to strike the country. [4] The cyclone left 34 fatalities in Tanzania. [1] January 28, 1984 - Tropical Storm Domoina struck southeastern Mozambique, and later crossed into Swaziland and eastern South Africa. In Mozambique, Domoina killed 109 people and caused about 75 million in damage. Rainfall in Swaziland reached 906 mm (35.7 in) at Piggs Peak . Damage in the country totaled 54 million, with 73 deaths. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950 mm (37 in, causing 100 year floods along the Umfolozi River . The Pongola River altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Across South Africa, the storm caused 60 deaths and damaged the properties of 500,000 people, causing R100 million (1984 ZAR , 70 million 1984 USD). [nb 1] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] February 19, 1984 - Tropical Storm Imboa looped off the east coast of South Africa, causing flooding and killing four people in the country. [11] [8] Image of United States helicopter flying over flooded Mozambique after Cyclone Eline January 3, 2000 - A tropical depression, previously Tropical Storm Astride , struck northeastern Mozambique and produced rainfall as far inland as Malawi. [12] February 22, 2000 - Cyclone Eline moved ashore near Beira, Mozambique. Exasperating previous floods , the cyclone produced the country's worst natural disaster in a century. Water levels along the Limpopo River reached as high as 11 m (36 ft) above normal and 15 km (9.3 mi) wide. [13] [14] The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 300,000 people homeless, [15] about 700 deaths, and damage estimated at 500 million (2000 USD). [12] The cyclone and the floods disrupted much of the economic progress Mozambique had made in the 1990s since the end of its civil war . [16] Eline also killed 21 people in South Africa, where damage reached at least US300 million. [12] [17] In Zimbabwe, Eline washed away transportation infrastructure and killed 12 people.

I shift like I have ADHD, wear out rear cables in 2000 miles which is every 10 weeks when riding a lot, and broke a few in the middle of rides when my current batch had shorter life. Electronic shifting would avoid that. Eschewing Campagnolo mechanical, electronic is also the only way to shift to the next ratio moving from large to small ring in a single motion (with Campagnolo, you can hit both thumb buttons to change rings and drop up to five cogs). Electronic also moves beyond Shimano’s inward flopping combined brake/shift lever and SRAM’s single up/down lever mechanism. It would save me the trouble of rebuilding my wheels with new hubs. Usually I run a PowerTap power meter rear (works with any pedals or crank), SON28 dynamo front (I can ride as long as I feel like without running out of lights or GPS power), and retro reflective powder coated rims with more shiny surface than reflectors combined with attractive anthracite grey finish during the day. Conversely, if I lived in the Pacific Northwest I’d get disc brakes because avid riders wear out their rims in a year when combining caliper brakes, road grit, and precipitation. The stopping power of rim brakes is great in dry weather - you can’t stop any quicker once the rear wheel is off the ground which is possible braking from the hoods using modern levers, dual-pivot brakes, and Kool Stop salmon pads In practice, neither is in my near future. Cable replacement isn’t a big deal with a swap taking just a few minutes and lifetime predictable within a batch.

However, there are a few news organizations that are often recognized for their commitment to journalistic integrity and balanced reporting. Here are some examples: 1. Associated Press (AP): The AP is a nonprofit news agency that provides coverage on a wide range of topics. Their reporting is known for being factual, impartial, and widely used by various news outlets. 2. Reuters: Another respected news agency, Reuters aims to deliver unbiased and accurate news from around the world. They strive to present information without editorial bias, making them a reliable source for many. 3. BBC News: Although based in the UK, BBC News provides comprehensive coverage of both domestic and international news. Their commitment to impartial reporting has earned them a reputation for reliability and objectivity. 4. NPR (National Public Radio): NPR is a public radio network in the US that produces news and cultural programming. They aim to provide balanced reporting and are known for their in-depth coverage and diverse perspectives. 5. The Wall Street Journal: While it has a business focus, The Wall Street Journal is often regarded as a reputable news source with a commitment to objective reporting. However, it is worth noting that some critics argue it has a conservative leaning in its opinion section. 6. The New York Times: The New York Times is a widely read newspaper that covers various topics with in-depth reporting. While it has been accused of bias by some, it is generally regarded as a credible source for news. Remember that even the most respected news organizations may have some inherent biases or limitations. It is always advisable to consume news from multiple sources, cross-reference information, and critically evaluate the content to form a well-rounded understanding of a particular issue.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"The answer to this question is no, but I wonder what would be the point of anybody doing such a thing? A mother always knows if the child is biologically related to her or not—unless you asking if they switched the babies at the hospital or whatever, while fatherhood is only a state one arrives at by adoption. There is no such thing as “biological fatherhood”. This is a myth of materialism and so something our culture gets very wrong, and you can see it in how incoherent are the laws it makes in response to such questions. For example, a “biological father” in the U.S. might be forced to pay for a child he has no interested in adopting but at the same time gets no say in whether or not a pregnancy is terminated (not that I am advocating for abortion, simply acknowledging its present legality and the fact that somehow a person who because he had sex with a women is supposed to actually be the “father” but yet clearly doesn’t enjoy the same rights in regard to that child—well obviously right? Because motherhood and fatherhood are, biologically speaking, distinctly different things.) The fact is that there is no choice about fatherhood until there is a legal person because until then you don’t have a chance to adopt the person. If the law recognized this simple fact—ironically enough of nature—then the type of weird situation I just described wouldn’t be possible—and if this seems strange to anybody reading this, it just goes to show how distorted are the effects of modern society because of it pervasive commitments to materialism in obscuring one’s ability to discern the natural law, which I would assert is a huge reason for the widespread mental disorders experienced in our society, such as depression and anxiety. Consequently, if when there is a legal person and you adopt that person, then you’re the father. If later you find out that person is not biologically related to you and you want to renege on your commitments and responsibilities as a father then you’re engaging in one of the worst forms of incivility and human betrayal possible. A healthy family, by the way, has both a mother and a father as social science is readily confirming [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #ONXeR] , but here’s the problem a child must have a mother (although obviously, not all mothers are naturally fit or good mothers) but it doesn’t have to have a father, and here lies a large part of the problem with poor communities in the U.S. because of welfare, which are also in many cases minority communities. They’ve been devastated by the destruction of the family, and so they often stay poor and all the associated problems that it brings along with it. The social policies that created this injustice were based on the faulty logic of presuming that such a thing as biological fatherhood exists. So consequently and paradoxically, instead of incentivizing fathers (making for an environment inducive to wholesome families—I am not necessarily against welfare, just so-called “welfare” policies that actually hurt communities) it incentivized families without fathers on the presumption that men who might just happen to have impregnated the women were the “fathers” (and if a kid has a father then they obviously don’t need a formal situation to induce one). Again, a formal marriage allows for the father’s claim over the children—which is essentially legal and not biological. Like marriage, itself, fatherhood is a legal statement of love. Motherhood on the hand is actually biological—and nature does its best to ensure there will be love there too through a cocktail of neurochemicals [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #cPIEp] —and both of these forms of parentage are necessary and illustrative*. In life, we need both the natural and the supernatural (and law can be thought of as a type of supernatural condition—it is certainly not a condition that other animals enjoy). However, if the law is not grounded in the natural law then it simply becomes a perversity and alienates us from our own selves. So your question basically assumes a false premise that somehow you could believe yourself to be a father of the child that wasn’t actually your child on the assumption that fatherhood is somehow rooted in biology. *neurochemicals also affect the father although in this case, it doesn’t stem from the biological situation, as with the mother, but rather the social one. In fact, we could say that the neurochemistry of family making is both natural and supernatural (biological and social) in both the mother and the father, however, in different ways and to differing degrees. Edit: some people apparently think this answer is “dumb” but haven’t provided any actual arguments for while they happen to think so. Nevertheless, we can presume it is because they are committed to a materialistic metaphysical worldview, even if they might not consciously understand what a metaphysical worldview is, which then implies that they probably just adopted it passively and uncritically from the society at large. I imagine, in fact, that there are actually a lot of persons like this, and it for this very reason I wrote the answer. It’s okay to be a materialist (who am I to say otherwise?), but one should never be committed to any metaphysical beliefs unthinkingly. It is with such blind beliefs that we can and arguably should take issue. To confuse one’s mere beliefs for a self-evident fact of reality is dangerous, and from my perspective, I believe there are many beliefs that stem from assuming a materialistic metaphysics that not only should be questioned but are actually damaging our society because they’ve been left unquestioned.

The difference between vocabulary per se and the knowledge we use it to convey is actually arbitrary, since it's rare to study words for their own sake. The vocabulary most people use represents the language they have overlearned. Very few people go beyond the 7,000 or so word families used in ordinary daily interactions. If however you are a highly educated person whose active vocabulary well exceeds this average, or if you use specialized vocabulary related to your work, you will tend to use the vocabulary you use with your peers at work with everyone else around you. This is natural and, on the surface of it, this doesn't make you a jerk.

How Much Money You Can Make with a Blog? The money you can make with a blog will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of readers you have and how often they visit your site.

While you may not be able to follow in the footsteps of these bloggers and become a millionaire overnight, it’s helpful to see what kind of earning potential different blogs have. For example, we took a look at food blogs and found that some of the best-paying blogs in this niche earn between 1,000 and 2,000 per month. Other blogs in the same niche are much lower, with some making as little as 20 per month. When you look at other blogs, it’s important to keep in mind that income will likely vary greatly depending on your skills, your topic, and the audience you’re able to attract. An estimate of how much you can make with a blog Let’s say you have a blog that attracts 3,000 visitors per month. If you can earn 1 per visitor and get one third of your visitors to buy something from your site, that would be 300 in monthly income. If you can increase the number of visitors to 5,000 per month, you’ll have an extra 500 in monthly income. While these estimates are just that – estimates – it’s helpful to see what kind of money is being made and what you could be earning if you have a successful blog. If you want to find out how much you can make with a blog, you’ll need to find out how many people visit your site and how often they visit. Should You Start a Blog for Income? There are a few things you should keep in mind before deciding to start a blog for income. One of the most important things to consider is whether you want to make a full-time commitment to blogging. If you’re looking to make some quick cash and then put your efforts elsewhere, a blog doesn’t have to be your only option. The other thing to keep in mind is whether you have the time required to build a successful blog and keep it growing. Many bloggers have full-time jobs and other responsibilities, which can make it challenging to consistently create quality content. As with many things in life, success will likely be determined by your skillset and the type of content you’re able to create. If your blog is based around product reviews, drawing on your knowledge and expertise will be crucial. If your blog is entirely based around pop culture, you may find it difficult to attract readers. Why Is It Difficult to Find reliable Information about How Much People Make With Blogs? There are a lot of claims about how much money bloggers can make with their sites, but it’s important to keep in mind that many of these claims are based on incorrect information. Some bloggers have misinterpreted statistics or haven’t taken steps to validate their income claims. There is a lot of misleading information out there, and it can be difficult to determine what is accurate and reliable information. Finding Out Why People Don’t Earn from Blogging One of the main reasons people don’t earn from their blogs is because they don’t have the skillset required to build and maintain a successful blog. If you aren’t familiar with how to create and publish quality content, you may find it difficult to attract readers and make money from a blog. In order to be successful with a blog, you’ll need to be familiar with WordPress, understand how to use blogging software, and be comfortable with making frequent updates to your site. It may be difficult to find the time to create quality content, monetize your content, promote your content, and maintain a successful blog. Conclusion Blogging can be a great way to build your personal brand, establish yourself as an expert in your field, and to get your name out there. After all, who wouldn’t want to read your thoughts on topics ranging from cocktails to culture? The amount of money you can make with a blog will depend on how many readers you can attract and how often they visit. If you're able to attract a large audience, you may be able to earn some side income through advertising or affiliate marketing. There are a lot of reasons why people don’t earn from their blogs, but it’s important to keep in mind that many bloggers simply don’t know how to make money from their sites. If you’re interested in earning some money from your blog, make sure to keep these tips in mind."},{"instruction":"it acceptable for German actors/actresses to play a role as Nazis in a movie?","output":"It’s acting.

What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"IQ measures a pretty narrow spectrum of kinds of intelligence and it has problems with those, but in those areas it’s at least somewhat meaningful. So, sure, if you look at my academic and professional life, being good at that kind of intellectual processing has helped me a lot. I’ve been able to move between fields and take on new knowledge, and it didn’t seem especially hard, but more to the point, it’s been fun. I need to learn new things. This is the primary reason I headed into research. In tech, once you became known as being really good at a particular thing, there was always pressure to continue to do that thing, which tended to get tedious. Now it’s my job to do things no one has done before, and I love it. (And yes, I’m still kind of a weirdo amongst my colleagues, but it doesn’t seem to be a problem?) It was a lot harder when I was younger - I was generally out of step with my peers, and it was harder to find people I had things in common with. (It didn’t help that my mother way highly resistant to me entering the gifted program for many years.) School often wasn’t challenging - which was a problem, because I like to be challenged. Also, because I could be disruptive when bored… But as I got older, and the world opened up for me more, I found more and more people whom I could relate to. For me, at least, this helped me learn a lot about relating to people I had a lot less in common with. I like people. Most people. Though not all people in large doses. For me, learning how to talk about cooking and gardening with my neighbors was a lot of fun - kind of like learning a new language. (I hear so much complaining about small talk, and I think there’s a lot more communication going on there than many people credit.) If there’s been area that has frequently been a problem, it’s dating men. (I’m bi, so I have options, which helps.) So many men think they’re attracted to smart women, but have some kind of assumption that those women will either be less smart than them, or will be subservient to them in the relationship. My ex husband, for instance, told me that I should let him be better than me in the computer industry (where we both worked) and martial arts (our primary outside activity together) because I had “so many other things I was good at”. Aside from the absurdity of thinking this is an okay thing to ask for, I’m still blown away by the idea that I was suppose to pretend to be less good at these things than I was. (Sadly, this wasn’t just this one relationship.) I tend to think of this as a less of a problem with being bright than a problem with our society thinking it’s reasonable to cast women as supporting characters in their own lives. And I certainly know plenty of men who are perfectly lovely. But let’s return to how IQ only measures a fairly narrow span of intelligence. Sure, there are ways having a high IQ can make life a bit harder when you’re young. But most of the rest of things either points to other areas where you might have deficits, or things that you can go out and fix. Communication skills are something that you can work on. What is the internet for if not for finding groups of people you have things in common with? (Okay, we know this. The internet is for cat pics and porn.)"},{"instruction":"What are the differences between Madhva and Shankaracharya in terms of their interpretation of Vedanta?","output":"Both Madhvācārya and Śaṅkarācārya have established two distinct Saṃpradāyas i.e. Tattvavāda and Daśanāmi, each with its divergent theological position and contrasting philosophy. Dvaitavāda of Madhvācārya- Madhvācārya evolved a dualistic school of thought from the Prasthānatraya viz. the Upaniṣads, Vedas, and Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, and thus proposed the Dvaitavāda/Bhedavāda philosophy. The Dvaita doctrine holds the individual Self i.e. Jīvātman eternally different from the Supreme Self i.e. Paramātmā. Madhvācārya asserts both qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls. The Saṃsāra is real, and not an illusion, and neither is it a transformation of God. The Īśvara is svatantra(independent) while the individual ātman and Prakṛti are paratantra(dependent on God) and thus have no separate existence from him. Madhvācārya asserts that God is personal and Saguṇa(with infinite attributes). The Upaniṣadic concept of Brahman denotes Viṣṇu alone(brahmaśabdaśca Viṣṇaveva), and he is one without a second, the all-mighty, omnipresent, omniscient Bhagavān. The jīvātman does not attain equality with Paramātmā through Mokṣa. It is entitled only to serve the Glorious Lord. There exists a Five-fold difference(Pañcabheda) between Īśvara(Nārāyaṇa), jīvā, and the insentient(Acit)- Īśvara-jīvā bheda-The distinction between God and the individual soulĪśvara-acit bheda-The distinction between God and matterJīvā-acit bheda-The distinction between the individual soul and matterJīvā-jīvā bheda-The distinction between one soul and anotherAcit-acit bheda-The distinction between one material thing and another Advaitavāda of Śankarāchārya- The philosophical position as put forward by Śankarāchārya is of exclusive non-dualism i.e. Kevalādvaita. The entire doctrine of Advaita can be summed up in half a shloka from Brahmajñānāvalīmālā- brahma satyaṃ jaganmithyā jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ Basically, Śankarāchārya stated that The Brahman alone is real, the Jagat(world) is unreal and the Jīvātman and Paramātmā are non-dual. Brahman itself is absolutely homogeneous. All differences and plurality are illusionary and arise only due to Ajñāna or ignorance. Brahman is all-full, infinite, changeless, self-existent, self-delight, self-knowledge, and self-bliss. It is the svarūpa i.e.the essence of the knower. It is the Seer(Dṛṣṭa), Transcendent(Turīya ), and Silent Witness(Sākṣi). Śankarāchārya’s Supreme Brahman is impersonal, Nirguṇa(without Guṇas or attributes), Nirākāra(formless), Nirviśeṣa(without special characteristics), immutable, eternal, and Ākarta(non-agent). Brahman is non-dual(advaitam), one without a second. It has no other besides It. It is destitute of difference, either external or internal. The world is considered as a Vyāvahārika Satya i.e. relatively real, while the Brahman is considered as Pāramārthika Satya i.e. absolutely real. In fact, the world is considered a product of Māyā or Avidyā. Most importantly, to Śankarāchārya, the Jīvātman or the individual soul is only relatively real. Its individuality lasts only so long as it is subject to unreal Upādhīs or limiting conditions due to Avidyā. The Jīvātman identifies itself with the body, mind, and the senses when it is deluded by Avidyā or ignorance. It thinks, acts, and enjoys, on account of Avidyā. The Advaita school of thought also places great importance on the Four Mahāvākyas (great sayings or sentences) taken from Upadeśa Prasthāna (injunctive texts), and the Śruti Prasthāna (the starting point or axiom of revelation). These are- Prajñānam brahma – “Prajñāna is Brahman” from the Aitareyopaniṣad of the Rig VedaAyam ātmā brahma – “This Self (Atmā) is Brahman” from the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad of the Atharva VedaTat tvam asi – “You are That” from the Chāndogyopaniṣad of the Sama VedaAham brahmāsmi – “I am Brahma” from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad of the Yajur Veda Namo Nārāyaṇa!"},{"instruction":"w do I start a successful YouTube channel and become a YouTuber?","output":"Starting a channel on YouTube can be an exciting venture.

This process can be long, but it's essential to make sure your novel is the best it can be.Query letters and submission guidelines: Research and target the publishing houses, agents or platforms that are a good match for your novel, and then find their guidelines for submitting your manuscript. Most agents and publishers will ask for a query letter, which is a brief overview of your book, along with a synopsis and the first few chapters of the manuscript.Follow up: Publishers and agents are often swamped with submissions, so be prepared for a long wait. Once you've sent in your manuscript, don't be afraid to follow up with a polite email or call to inquire about the status of your submission.Be patient: Getting published takes time and persistence. Rejection is a common part of the process and doesn't mean that your book is bad. Keep working on your craft, keep submitting your manuscript and keep writing.

What is gravitation really? We still don’t know. Gamow was disappointed (around 1960) that scientists did not pay attention at this mysterious force. Today we find more than 8000 theories about this subject. Thousands of scientists, laymen, dissidents and crackpots spend a lot of time on gravitation. They all think that there is something about gravitation that must be cleared by some new explanation. At this moment there is no theory that is broadly accepted as scientific valuable. In spite of all precise measuring and formulas gravitation is still a remarkable physic phenomenon. Gravitation is a phenomenon that we all know too well: all our actions have been based on that force. So just because of our familiarity with this force we have the risk to “stand on it” not really knowing on what force we stand. When we observe the world around us, we do this using our senses in connection with our brain which leads to our awareness and our consciousness in space and time. This consciousness has always been bound by nature (biological and neurological) to each individual person. That consciousness is always in the middle of the surrounding world and has been used to orientate ourselves: where are we, who are we. So in earlier days everybody knew that the sun is going to come up and turn around through the sky; this was an ordinary experience for each individual; everyone observed that the sun rises up and goes down. When a broadly accepted idea was thrown away by various discoveries and calculations then it takes some time before this [LINKED_TEXT: new interpretation is accepted] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIy76M-4txo] (Galaxy song). I think that there must be a good reason that gives a logical explanation WHY we still are in confusion about gravity. I think our confusion is CAUSED by our consciousness: being a part of the physic world in a manner as people on a floating island don’t realize that they are floating. So I have a proposal that is related to the sub questions above. I think we need a team of cooperating scientist of very different sciences as physics, neuropsychology, geology, archaeology, cosmology, quantum physics, chemists, social sciences, (epi)genetics, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and technic engineering. Probably we need some elements of different theories to put together. Some parts to combine, some parts to throw away, some parts to change. There must be something that we did overlook until now. It would be a great step if some university would form a “Task Force Gravitation” to clear this basic question of physics and life. That could give a new approach, a new motivation and replace hope in solution."},{"instruction":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","output":"I’ll try to be short with this answer: A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse. Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy. If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you. Modern proxy servers do much more than forwarding web requests, all in the name of data security and network performance. Proxy servers act as a firewall and web filter, provide shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests. A good proxy server keeps users and the internal network protected from the bad stuff that lives out in the wild internet. Lastly, proxy servers can provide a high level of privacy.

This article will serve as your compass, leading you through the exciting trip of investing and trading, whether you're a seasoned Wall Street enthusiast or an inquisitive novice ready to dip your toes in the financial water. Chapter 1: Laying the Foundation - Investing vs. Trading Before we dive headfirst into the action, let's distinguish between investing and trading. Investing is akin to planting seeds, patiently nurturing them as they grow into mighty oaks, providing bountiful fruits over time. On the other hand, trading is akin to dancing on the waves, quick and nimble, taking advantage of short-term price movements. Both avenues offer unique opportunities, and it's essential to understand your goals and risk tolerance before you embark on your financial voyage. Chapter 2: The Stock Market - Your Personal Playground Welcome to the stock market's playground of possibilities! Dreams of wealth and success come true here. Investing in stocks entails becoming a part owner of a firm, and trading them is all about timing your buys and sells. It's similar to riding a roller coaster, and while there are ups and downs, the exhilaration is palpable. Chapter 3: Success Techniques: The Art of the Deal Ah, the alluring world of investment strategies! Whether you're a cautious tortoise or a daring hare, there's a strategy that suits your style. For the long-term investor, buy and hold may be the mantra, riding the steady growth of a well-chosen portfolio.

Step into the realm of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins - where the rules are different, and fortunes can be made overnight.

It's like pitting art against science, yet both are indispensable in the world of investing and trading. Fundamental analysis delves into a company's financial health, while technical analysis reads the patterns on the price charts. Mastering both arts will elevate your trading game to legendary status. Chapter 6: Taming the Wild Bull and Bear - Risk Management Just like herding wild animals, managing risk in the market is crucial. The mighty bull and the ferocious bear often dictate the market's direction, and without proper risk management, you may find yourself in a precarious position.

I will warn u when u get to that point Nana Shimura (志し村むら菜な奈な) the mother of Kotaro Shimura, Father of Tenko Shimura also known as Tomura Shigaraki. In other words, she is the grandmother of Shigaraki. Ironically, Nana (七) is the Japanese word for \\"seven\\", her being the seventh One For All user. Nana is also a common nickname for a grandmother in many languages, referencing to her being Tomura Shigaraki literal grandmother. Why is she the strongest mother in my hero academia. Well she is the only mother we know that was a pro hero. and as for strength, Quirk One For All: Transferred to her from the sixth user, Nana's second Quirk allowed her to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, allowing her to significantly enhance all of her physical abilities to a superhuman level. This results in unbelievable levels of strength, speed, agility, and durability. Float: Nana's Quirk granted her the ability to suspend herself in mid-air. It is currently unknown if she was able to maneuver herself while levitating. Trained Muscles: Usage of One For All requires the user to have strong muscles, as One For All is a lot to handle and could cause the users body to be blown apart if they don't possess the necessary strength of body. Nana's signature smile. Nana was a kind woman with a strong sense of justice. She believed that a true hero should smile, no matter how grim the situation. Furthermore, she was a loving mother to her son before she died at the hands of All For One, and was shown to be compassionate, nurturing, and supportive of him. Spoiler //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Spoiler Except for the fact that she gives up on her son(which is how the League of Villains was created (not really) ) After his mother gave him up, Kotaro developed a deep hatred towards his mother, feeling as though she abandoned him for the sake of strangers. This eventually grew into a hatred for all heroes, viewing them as selfish people whose actions only served to harm their own families. As a result of this hatred, he showed open disdain for anything hero related and became both physically and emotionally abusive towards his son whenever he showed interest in or even mentioned heroes around him. This is seen again when he attacked the child for finding the picture of his paternal grandmother and condemning her memory. Ironically, he started doing the very thing he believed all heroes were guilty of and instilling his son's future hatred of heroes and society. Which ended up being his last day.

These included being excessively happy, sitting on a beanbag, exercising too much, and asking if we had Cannellini beans. That’s not even comprehensive. Excessively Happy At my very first supervision at a unit, I was informed I was ‘too happy’. I asked for elaboration and essentially people had complained that I was too active in the mornings when they were tired. At the time, I used to walk a mile to work listening to Sabaton, and after the first 30 minutes, I would have to do 2 exercise routines with my clients. I thought it was rather understandable that I would be high energy. I’m still bewildered about it to be honest because it wasn’t as if I was really talking to my colleagues except for two I consider friends. Sitting On A Bean Bag In the lounge area of our unit, we had a small black bean bag. No one ever used it, but when my colleagues would start gossiping about people (something I was very uncomfortable with) I’d take it and sit elsewhere to do my work. Apparently, someone reported me for sitting on it. So I had to be spoken to super seriously about sitting on a beanbag. No one could explain why it was wrong, so instead, they cut up the bean bag. Not Interrupting A Client… uh… well So when I was still green I worked with a non-verbal client. I’d make their food and knock on their bedroom door and open it enough to show them the food so they’d know it was lunchtime. On one occasion I opened the door to find them masturbating. So, not to embarrass them I quickly closed it and put the lunch back in the kitchen. We had a logbook where you report why you don’t do things on time etc. I wrote a quick note “X’s lunch is late, they’re masturbating and I don’t want to disturb them, will try again in 15 minutes”. Two managers showed up to interrogate me, a mass text was sent out about not using the word ‘masturbating’. I was reduced to tears by two squawking harpies and then paraded in front of the unit before I was allowed to go home. It was incredibly bizarre and I ended up leaving that specific unit because of the ordeal. Exercising too much At the start of the pandemic, everything closed. This meant a lot of the gyms and stuff my clients liked to do were not available. So I made a point of organising long walks, nature trails, things to appeal to them. I even downloaded the INaturalist app and had some of the guys who liked plants and animals in order to help take pictures and count them for the app. Apparently, I got reported for ‘hogging the time outside the unit’ because other people would like to go outside. In my off time, I mainly play video games and read, I don’t know why people didn’t think they could just volunteer to go out with the guys themselves. I honestly would have enjoyed the extra time to do my paperwork and sit around drinking tea. Asking if we had Cannellini Beans This one only happened a short time ago. I was supporting one of my clients to make dinner and she wanted to make Chilli Con Carne. To her dismay, she found there were no kidney beans. I was like “hey that’s okay, are there Cannellini beans?”My manager who walked in was like “There are baked beans” It honestly hadn’t occurred to me that baked beans could go in a chilli con Carne because they are sweet so I said.Me: “Oh, we’re looking for beans for her Chilli Con Carne” To which my manager proceeded to get completely irate and told me to use the baked beans. I found some kidney beans fortunately so disaster averted. Apparently, my manager gossiped about it so hard that even my colleague got sick of hearing about it and began to mock her behind her back for not knowing what Cannellini beans are. Needless to say, those two units were interesting."},{"instruction":"What are some unique startup ideas for India?","output":"Some great startup ideas for India, according to we, Katemodel Consultants are: Pickup tailoring shop in your home townPriest on demandFood delivery from mess to students and bachelors in your townBarber at home in your townTravel AgencyReal Estate AgencyStudent Counseling centerIn town marriage and dating agencyGovernment Document processing center like Aadhar, Pan, Passport, Driving LicenseStarting Digital Currency Pool Regards Katemodel Consultants"},{"instruction":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52.

I turned around on her and approached the car. She was so nervous she was shaking. I requested the usual…Driver’s License, Registration and Insurance and as she was retrieving the documents I realized that I recognized her. She was the young waitress who usually served me coffee and breakfast at a local restaurant. So anyway, as she hands me the license I noticed there was a paper clip attached to it. Now, many of us have had this before and it was most often a 50 or 100 bill used as a bribe to get out of the ticket so I asked her, “Are you sure you want to hand this drivers license to me as is?” She looked confused. I repeated my question and warned her that if there was money clipped to the DL she would be arrested for attempted bribery. Through very teary eyes she looked confused but assured me that, “Yes, this is my driver’s license.” My heart sank to my stomach because I liked this kid and did not want to arrest her. I walked back to my patrol car and reviewed the proof of insurance and registration. With a grimace on my face and some hesitation I turned the DL over to its back side and found a “Get out of Jail Free” card from Community Chest of the game Monopoly. I cracked up and laughed out loud. It took a few moments for me to compose myself. So, I took the “Get out of Jail Free” card and placed it in my shirt pocket and returned to her car window (I kept the card). I smiled broadly and said, “OK young lady, this is your one chance.

Here are some common practices: Recycling and reprocessing: Many hotels partner with soap recycling organizations or initiatives that collect used soap bars. These organizations sanitize and reprocess the soap to create new bars for needy people. This process helps reduce waste and provides hygiene products to communities that may not have easy access.Donations: Some hotels donate their used soap to local charities, homeless shelters, or organizations that support those in need. These organizations can distribute the soap to individuals and communities who benefit from it.Hygiene kits: Hotels may repurpose partially used soap bars by creating hygiene kits. These kits can include soap, shampoo, conditioner, and other toiletries and are often donated to charitable organizations or disaster relief efforts.Employee use or sale: Sometimes, hotels allow their staff members to use partially used or unopened soap bars. This helps minimize waste and ensures that the products are put to use. Alternatively, hotels may offer these products for sale in gift shops or online platforms, allowing guests to purchase them.Environmentally friendly disposal: In cases where recycling or donation is not feasible, hotels may dispose of the used soap in an environmentally friendly manner. This can involve proper waste management procedures, such as sending it to appropriate recycling or waste treatment facilities. It's worth noting that specific practices may vary depending on the hotel's policies, location, and partnerships with recycling or charitable organizations. However, many hotels strive to minimize waste and make socially and environmentally conscious choices regarding the management of used soap.

In a nutshell, string theory, or the more general form, M theory, posits that everything in the universe can be built up from tiny strings that vibrate. It requires 11 dimensions, 7 more than the relativistic model of 4, three spacial and one time. The remaining dimensions are so tightly coiled that we cannot observe them. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum and relativity theory. There are several problems. M theory was developed as a generalization of earlier theory, because there were multiple possible ways to describe the multiple dimensions. Furthermore, there is at yet no experimental verification of string theory on the large scale, and it may be impossible to find such verification, which is an enormous problem. Smolin makes the case that string theory has crowded out other possible lines of investigation in the central problem—unifying quantum theory and relativity theory. There is a certain elegance to string and M theory—but unless it can be verified experimentally, it can only be regarded as highly tentative. Physics as a discipline is in a very interesting state right now. It is taking longer and longer to solve fundamental theoretical problems. The Higgs field, for instance, was initially posited over 50 years ago, but there was no experimental verification until 2012. The bridge between the macroscopic world and the quantum world—the collapse of the wave function—still relies on the Copenhagen interpretation, which is very unsatisfying. It will be more interesting to see what happens in coming years. It may well be that we need a theoretical breakthrough comparable to relativity and quantum theory, both of which are 100 years ago—and I doubt if string theory is the answer."},{"instruction":"What is the real meaning of friendship?","output":"A close relationship between two or more individuals that is marked by trust, caring, respect, support, and affection is referred to as friendship. It is a connection that develops over time when people share common experiences, feelings, and interests. Friendship is fundamentally about having a strong sense of empathy and caring for the other person. Friends sincerely care about one another's happiness, prosperity, and personal development, according to this statement. They support one another emotionally, encourage one another when things are tough, and commemorate one another's victories and significant anniversaries. Mutual regard, trust, and honesty are other important components of friendship. Friends can talk to one another honestly and openly without worrying about being judged or rejected. They are trustworthy and dependable, and you can rely on them to keep their word and uphold secrecy when it's required.

My friend (lets call him “Suraj”) and I were looking at movies and shows available on BookMyShow throughout the day and couldn’t decide the movie and show, but zeroing on shows in E-Square, Shivaji Nagar.After dinner, we got on a call and Suraj told me that he has booked ticket of [LINKED_TEXT: Kungfu Panda 2] [URL: https://www.quora.com/topic/Kungfu-Panda-2-1] and He has called mutual friend (call him “Atul”), as well, who was planning to come with us.

Got answer that they are on seat numbers mentioned as earlier and can’t find me. Then I asked my friend “IN WHICH CINEMA HALL ARE YOU ?” , Answer was a Cinema Hall just 3 KM from my home (CitiPride Kothrud). I then drove to correct venue , reached to my seat , sat down and “INTERMISSION”. (Yeah, Indian Cinema halls have intermission in 1.30 hrs length movie.)

This refers to a company changing its strategy or direction in response to market conditions or new opportunities. This maneuver can be particularly effective when a company is struggling, as it allows them to find new sources of revenue and revitalize their business. An example of this is Netflix, which started as a DVD-by-mail rental service in 1997, but as the streaming technology evolved and the internet improved, Netflix saw an opportunity and decided to pivot to streaming video in 2007. This allowed them to take advantage of the growing trend of online streaming and eventually become one of the largest streaming services in the world. The pivot allowed Netflix to stay relevant in an industry that was rapidly changing and ultimately helped the company to thrive. Another example is the company, Apple, which was initially known for its personal computers in the 1980s and early 1990s, but then shifted its focus to portable music players with the launch of the iPod in 2001, and then smartphones with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. These product launches not only helped Apple to stay relevant but also helped it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In both these examples, the companies were able to identify new market opportunities and shift their strategies accordingly. This allowed them to stay ahead of the competition and grow their business, proving that a well-executed pivot can be a shrewd and smart maneuver in business. In summary, the ability to pivot one's business model can be a shrewd and smart maneuver in business. It allows a company to take advantage of new market opportunities and stay relevant in an ever-changing business landscape. It's important to be open to new opportunities and adapt to changing market conditions in order to be successful in business."},{"instruction":"Can you use a mouse with a smart TV?","output":"Well, I just tried it out - a Logitech wireless mouse, with a Samsung smart TV (one of the older models), and to my great surprise it actually worked! It worked so well that I am seriously considering buying a mouse to go with the TV. Normally, when you move the on-screen pointer using the arrow keys on the remote control, it has 2 modes. In one mode the pointer jumps from link to link, which is reasonably fast - but it doesn’t work on things like buttons. In the other mode, you can move the pointer anywhere, as you would with a mouse, and it works on buttons, but it is SLOW-W-W. When I connect a mouse, however, I can move the pointer anywhere at a reasonable speed.

It is a source of relief and comfort. If you are planning to buy a new [LINKED_TEXT: mattress] [URL: https://holdermattress.com/], take the time to read up on several important things you should know before buying one. 1. Primarily focus on comfort because even if you buy the most expensive mattress, you won’t have the best sleeping experience of your life if you’re not comfortable on it. 2. Perfect Mattress size is required because If you feel restricted by a narrow bed, then you need a more spacious double bed. A queen size may be a bit large for an individual person, but it’s great if you like the extra space. King-sized or California king mattresses are made for partners and for master bedrooms and offer plenty of space for couples. 3. Test the mattress first and then buy. Most of the shopkeepers will let you sleep and test the mattress which will help you get the exact experience of the sleep on that mattress. 4. Read the online reviews before buying because this gives you a more practical idea of the popular mattresses currently available and allows you to narrow down the huge field of choices. 5. Do not select the most soft ones because too much softness will sag under the middle area of the spine, which can cause poor posture and lead to back pain. 6. An adjustable air bed is a safe but expensive option. Since you can adjust the firmness and softness with a remote, you’re safer even without first testing the mattress. 7. Decide on a budget and stick to it as, the prices of mattresses vary greatly, so you need to set a price you are willing to pay and not go over that amount.

Problems: They only buy their IP’s and then doing nothing with them. They have all these amazing studios and have done nothing. They’re sitting on Conker and Banjoo-Kazooi, but won’t make any games based off those IP’s and anything else Microsoft has done with RARE has been lackluster at best. Everyone was concerned that aquiring Activision was going to be the death of PlayStation. When ironically Nintendo’s managed to survive this era without CoD. I was concerned I’d never see another Spyro game.Kinda ties in with 1. Instead of making their own IP’s they buy them instead of creating their own image and personality. PlayStation has it’s own identity of what makes a PlayStation game. Nintendo has their own identity of what makes a Nintendo game. Microsoft doesn’t. They did in the 360 days, but now nothing.They don’t have any games too call their own or any of real interest. Too me at least. “We have Halo” okay, I don’t like shooters. What else do they got? “Um Gears Of War” okay that’s just Halo in third person. What else. “Forza….” you don’t have anything do you? “No.” Everything else has failed, or you can get on a platform you more than likely already care about even ignoring the PC. love Ori? Don’t need an Xbox to play it. I was interested in Cuphead. But I don’t need an Xbox to play it. I appreciate having games on a platform I already care about but then you might as well go third party by that point instead of wasting peoples money.“We have Game Pass and Backwards Compatibility” great. Those are cool extras though. Not a good reason to buy a console. Now that I beat Sonic Unleashed, I don’t even care about my Xbox anymore, if I wanna replay Sonic Unleashed about it I’ll just tolerate the problems it had on PS3. Sure it’s the worst version but at least I’m playing it on a platform that I genuinely care about. If Xbox would get their heads in the game and actually develop games people want then less PlayStation fans or even Nintendo fans would hate the Xbox. I wanna be an Xbox fan, I just love gaming but Xbox doesn’t have any. They give you barely any reason to give a care about it, and I’m convinced Microsoft doesn’t care anymore either. I love the underdog, I loved my Wii U, and I didn’t even really care about the games on PlayStation until Spider-Man came out. How can you expect me to care about Xbox when it feels like Xbox doesn’t care about Xbox? Here’s my nitpicks of why I don’t like Xbox. Again these are just my personal opinion and I fully admit it’s just my problem. Trophies sound cooler than Achievments.twin-stick is better than offset. I will die on that hill. I except it from Nintendo because I love Nintendo itself. Plus there’s more third parties willing to make PlayStation like controllers for Nintendo and the only PlayStation like controller I could find for a Series X is from 8bitdo.The PlayStation and Nintendo prompts look way better than the Xbox button promptsI can’t change the display settings for the console to better fit my screen on TV. Seriously Microsoft? Even Nintendo does that. Why is the company whose behind the times more often have a much more modern setting than you?The cases for both Nintendo and PlayStation just look better on a shelfBad names for their consoles. 360 is probably the best name they have. Xbox ONE, Xbox ONE S, Xbox ONE X? Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S? Is Xbox trying to confuse people? Sure PlayStation isn’t creative but at least it’s kind of hard to get confused. Sure Nintendo has creative names but with the exception of the Wii U, it’s easy to understand which Nintendo console you’re looking for. It doesn’t help that the Series X doesn’t do much to differentiate itself from the Xbox ONE."},{"instruction":"What are the steps in writing a dissertation?","output":"The most effective technique to improve your dissertation writing 1. Don't put off starting: People are accustomed to believing that this is the most accessible portion of the job, especially once the real work is over. But don't put too much emphasis on writing; following the primary research phase, students often struggle to analyse all of the data. It's important to remember that it's never too early to begin. 2. Take notes: You'll keep track of the findings of your study to save time when looking for the information you need. You'll also avoid plagiarism by citing all of your sources. If you have any questions about the originality of your work, you should run it through a free plagiarism checker so that you don't have to worry about it while defending your [LINKED_TEXT: dissertation writing] [URL: http://www.dissertationhomework.com/dissertation-writing-services]. 3. Stay in touch with your advisor: Most people are hesitant to exhibit their papers until they are confident that the job is complete, which is a significant error. It's critical to communicate with your advisor throughout the dissertation writing process, and this will assist you in identifying typical errors and viewing the text from a different perspective. 4. Don't ask your friends how much they've completed: this will obstruct your progress because you'll be thinking about their papers and comparing the outcomes. 5. Remember to sleep: Eat well, feed your brain, and avoid sleepless nights. You must remain productive, which is impossible if you do not get sufficient rest. 6. Concentrate on the work: While discipline is necessary, the most important thing is to help your brain focus on the task and prevent multitasking. 7.

Same is true in the USA: states with more guns have less violent crime.) The “liberals” are lying: no need for conservatives to follow their lead, and repeat their errors of understanding of the real workld data. Re- abortion - there’s a lot of it about - spontaneously. Half the ova fertilised are aborted within the first trimester - it’s God’s way of admitting that he screwed up. I am a man, and have no experience of it personally. I have a niece who lost five babies on the trot - gave up - adopted, or rather fostered five other children - then bore a daughter - now a graduate from Durham Universioty - and a lesbian - and happily hooked up with some other such. So, what do I THINK about it ? Sad. Natural abortions will continue. Artificially induced abortions - are something necessary - occasionally - in very sad cases -especially for rape victimes who do not want to bear the child of a violent unwanted other - or very young/foolish girls - children, sometimes - who have been abused or misled. I see no moral grounds for anyone to deny them such a solution to their problems, certainly not the government. “Gay Marriage” is disgusting. I do not mean that homhsexual activity is disgusting - it may be, I do not know, nor care - but forcing the Church to perform marriage ceremonies for people who choose to flout its teachings, and refuse to conform to its requireements, strikes me as a (typical) GROSS breach of the distinction between Church and State, between politicos and Theologians. I am an atheist, and do not care about the Church AT ALL - but I gave friends who are religious (most Christians, of various confessions, a few Jews and Muslims, and some “other” - orientals) and I do not approve of arrogant politicians telling these others how they should run their own houses. Gays (?) can form partnerships if they want to, on any terms they like, to provide some pecuniary stability in case of death or disease - not that there will be any dependent children to provide for - so it is hardly a matter for the Government to get involded in. They may “want” a church ceremony - but I fail to see how it can be legitimate for the government to force any church to provide the decorative background for an anti-religious legal documentation. You cannot always get what you want. As for the death penalty - sooner that than the reckless early release of ALLEGEDLY “reformed” killers.

So what’s going wrong? (And more importantly: How can you avoid this happening to you?) Why you can’t get visitors You’re not going to make any money as an affiliate if you can’t get your affiliate link in front of people. And this means you need to get visitors to your website. Let me just say this first: You could get thousands of visitors to your website today, while barely lifting a finger — If you’re willing to pay some serious money for it. (And then you better hope you make a profit — it’s not as easy as it sounds!) The thing that’s hard is getting visitors to your website without paying for them, either through the search engines or social media. So why can some people do it, but other people just seem to suck at it? The big thing to understand is that if you want free visitors, it’s pretty much always going to come down to whether you can get other people to share your stuff. You need people to LINK to your website from their website, because this is what will help your website rank well in the search engines. Or you need them to tell their friends and networks about your stuff on social media, blogs, forums etc, because this is what will give your site exposure (which will lead to more visitors and more links). So you need people to share. Got that? But here are the problems I see with affiliate sites that can’t get traffic: PROBLEM #1: Your website doesn’t make sense. I don’t understand what it’s about, so I’m not going to share it. PROBLEM #2: Your content is unremarkable. It doesn’t excite me, and it’s no better than anything else out there, so I’m not going to share it. PROBLEM #3: You’re trying to rank for topics/keywords that are just too competitive. There are already loads of website out there that are doing it way better than you, and those guys are already at the top. If I’m looking for an article to share, I’m gonna pick one of those other guys. I’m not going to share yours. Back in the old days, none of this mattered. You could just go out there and build a bunch of links to your own websites, and you’d be able to rise up the search engine rankings. But since Google’s Penguin came along, you need to go out and convince real people that your content is worth linking to. And guess what? Real people don’t want to link to crappy websites or crappy content. And who’s really good at building crappy websites? Affiliates. Because we’re not building them out of love. We're in it for the money. And it shows. So that’s the (very simplified) reason why you can’t get traffic. Basically, because your website and content aren’t very good, or because you’re going after keywords that are too competitive (AND your content isn't very good.) If you’re prepared to do a little bit more than the bare minimum, it actually becomes quite easy to make good money. How do you build content that doesn’t suck?

(Sometimes you just need to make a couple of quick tweaks, and other times it might be because you got things wrong from the very beginning.) ISSUE #1: You’re promoting products that don’t sell If you don’t choose the right products to promote, then no matter how great your website is… you’re going to have trouble selling them. You might have chosen products that just don’t sell well. Or you might be promoting great products, but you’re promoting them to the wrong people. Either way, you’re going to have a hard time making money. ISSUE #2: You’re not funnelling people towards a sale Just because you get someone to your site, it doesn’t mean they’re automatically going to want to buy something. The best affiliate sites are ones that effectively move their visitors closer to a sale through different kinds of content and subtle psychological tricks. Marketers like to call this a “funnel”, and that’s really what an affiliate site is — it’s a big funnel. Every page on your website should be leading your visitors towards a sale. (But that doesn’t just mean slapping a big link or a banner in the middle of the page. Some of the best funnels are ones where your visitor can’t even tell you’re trying to sell them something.) ISSUE #3: You’re targeting the wrong people If you’re only attracting the kind of visitors who are never going to buy anything… you’re probably not going to make many sales. A lot of times, affiliates focus too much on getting traffic, but don’t pay enough attention to whether that traffic will buy. Newsflash: Not all traffic is equal. Some kinds of traffic is much more likely to buy than other kinds. So if you’re focusing on the wrong kind… you’ll get lots of visitors, but still no money. The 4 steps to success as an affiliate #1: Choose the right products and niche to promote. Find products and niches that are going to perform well. #2: Target the right people — the ones who will buy. Target them with the right choice of keywords, and the right kind of content. #3: Build a solid funnel that moves people towards a sale. Say the right thing at the right time to build their interest in a product. #4: (And if you want free traffic) Create a website that people will want to share. Build content that gives people what they want, and the job of promoting your website becomes ridiculously easy. Learn how to build a website that ticks all of these boxes.

Apple has designed their products with ergonomics in mind, and adding a touch screen could go against their philosophy of creating products that are comfortable to use.Interface design: Apple's macOS operating system is designed for use with a mouse and keyboard, not for touch input. Adding touch screens to Macs could require significant changes to the user interface and user experience.Precision: Touch screens can be less precise than a mouse or trackpad, which can make it difficult to perform certain tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, such as photo or video editing.Cost: Adding touch screens to Macs would increase the cost of production, which would likely result in higher prices for consumers. However, it's worth noting that Apple has not ruled out the possibility of adding touch screens to Macs in the future.

With my grandchildren it’s easier since I’m not around them a lot. It’s important to remember that young children are extremely self-centered; this is normal. You must ask yourself what is the most desirable way to get your children to behave more or less as you wish. Ask yourself this when you are in a rational state, not when your kids have driven you to the point of exploding. In other words, think about how you will handle a similar situation the next time it occurs. Here’s an example; my young grandkids become very frustrated when they lose at games. It is not desirable to always let them win. The last time this happened with me I pointed out to the loser that he doesn’t really lose when someone else wins the game, because when the other person wins, it makes that person happy, and makes you more likely to be valued as his friend.

The unconscious mind exists below our conscious awareness. This is why we can’t directly control our unconscious mind. It takes a little more effort to be able to grow as a person using your unconscious mind. But, the unconscious mind can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and behaviors. By influencing your unconscious mind you can understand your motivations and your behaviors. Constant Self-Reflection and Mindfulness Regularly engage in self-reflection or mindfulness practices. Meditating, journaling, or simply taking time to observe your thoughts and emotions can help you become more aware of your unconscious patterns and triggers. The key to these practices is patience and consistency. You must also realize that you won’t see effects immediately, but that changes happen gradually. I have found that if you just jump into meditating or journaling you won’t get very far. You need to tweak your environment to remove distractions. You need to go into every session with the purpose of discovering yourself. Most importantly, you need to be accountable for yourself. 10 mins five times a week is way better than 2 hrs every other Sunday. Over time, these practices can help you become more self-aware, reduce stress, and cultivate a greater sense of clarity and well-being. Performing Dream Analysis Pay attention to your dreams and keep a dream journal. Dreams often contain symbolism and messages from the unconscious mind. Analyzing your dreams can provide valuable insights into your hidden emotions and thoughts. This can be a tricky thing to accomplish. When I wake I find that I usually have no recollection of what I dreamed of the night before. Although, when I do have a dream it is often the same or similar to dreams I have had in the past. And writing these dreams down provided me with valuable insight into my unconscious mind. After consistently keeping track of your dream, you may see emotions from your dreams manifest in your daily life.

When a close friend of mine received counseling he shared a lot about his past. This allowed the Counselor to gain a better understanding of how past experiences could be influencing your current behavior. By talking with a professional he was able to target the root cause of the problem and take actionable steps to fix it. Often when we are dealing with psychological problems we don’t talk about them. We fear that the people around us will treat us differently. A professional counselor or therapist is able to give us peace of mind. They also have the ability to provide us with an insight into our unconscious mind. Receiving counseling from a trained professional in psycho dynamic approaches can help with exploring your unconscious mind. Identifying Specific Triggers Identifying triggers can be very insightful into the unconscious mind. Humans are creatures of habit, and we tend to respond to similar situations in similar ways. Pay attention to identifying emotional reactions that seem out of proportion to the situation. The triggers can help you reveal underlying unconscious issues that might be influencing your response. Whenever you get yelled at you yell back. When you get bogged down with work you feel demotivated. When you listen to music you feel relaxed. Whenever you donate money you feel good about yourself. Triggers can be a variety of things. You should pay attention to them. Learn what they are and then control them. Figure out how to control the bad triggers, and find ways to express the good triggers. By controlling your emotional response to things you can begin to control your life. Regulating Your Emotions By learning to manage your emotions effectively, you can minimize the influence of unconscious emotions on your behaviors and decision-making. Start with holding the door open for a stranger. Saying thank you to the cashier. Picking up a piece of trash on the side of the road. If you want to influence your unconscious mind it will take time and effort. But, regulating your emotions is one of the easiest things that you can start doing right now. Small building blocks lay the foundation for monumental change. By repeatedly trying to influence your unconscious mind you will eventually reach your goal."},{"instruction":"Why did Kavanaugh say that Americans have a right to privacy after protestors ruined his meal at a steak house when he was part of the majority SCOTUS opinion that overturned roe on the basis that the constitution doesn't grant a right to privacy?","output":"You are essentially using a word (“privacy”) that has different meanings depending on context and interchanging them without distinction.

People didn't live as long, and they often had to struggle to survive due to lack of food and widespread diseases. Teenagers had to grow up quickly because they had to help support their families. It was a difficult and challenging time.But now, things are much easier for teenagers. We have access to entertainment, food, and a safer environment. If we get sick, we can go to the doctor and get medicine. Plus, there's not as much pressure on us to start working and making money right away. As a teenager myself, I have to admit that life seems pretty easy nowadays. In fact, many people would argue that this is the best time to be a teenager. However, the problem is that we often take all these things for granted. We don't fully understand or appreciate the hardships that our ancestors went through, including our grandparents and fathers. We have everything at our fingertips, and we've become somewhat spoiled and ungrateful because we've been protected from the harsh realities of life.This lack of gratitude and understanding is evident in the behavior of many young people today. You see videos of my generation, Generation Z, acting foolishly and making poor choices. The reason behind this is that we don't fully grasp what life could be like. We haven't experienced the same degree of suffering and challenges that our predecessors did. As a result, we don't have the capacity to truly appreciate what we have and feel grateful for it. I must include myself in this problem. Recently, I caught myself complaining about school after a tiring day. But then I realized how ungrateful I was being. My father worked really hard to send me to college, and here I was, complaining about it. It made me realize that we take so many things for granted, like the ability to eat whatever we want whenever we want or access any form of entertainment at any time. Actually this access of any form of entertainment at any time is what making us so unhappy. We need to learn to do boring things. Boredom is often seen as something negative, but it can actually have positive effects on our well-being. When we are bored, it allows our minds to wander and explore new ideas. It gives us the opportunity to reflect, daydream, and engage in creative thinking. Boredom can be a catalyst for innovation and personal growth. Life is supposed to be difficult and gen Z don't like the idea of difficulty. Do we? We were not made for sitting hours scrolling our life away. Stop numbing yourself with social media and instant gratification. Life is so short to do such things. We can't just take a pile and runway from problems.

Vlad was and is loved because: (In one of our many hours of darkness) he took us unruly, uneducated, chaotic romanians and steeled us into a most formidable weapon capable of standing against the greatest empire of the time (the Ottoman one). As soon as he took power he: Formed a real, uniform army made of professional soldiers.He imposed taxes on the boyars (the local upper class) who were virtually free from taxation and eliminates the unruly ones. Taming (at least for the moment) a dangerous and vile beast standing between Wallachia and progress. He confiscates their land and gives it to the peasants, who, in exchange are to be trained (during post-harvest months) into soldiers.He removes the parrasites (thieves and bandits, beggars, vagabonds, plague afflicted people) like no one else was able before (something very cruel in our modern eyes, but a necessity as far as our survival was concerned, in those days).He centralizes the state and builds fortifications, churches (cultural and educational centers we modern people fail to appreciate often) and expands the capital.He also creates a nobility based only on meritocracy.He undertakes infrastructure construction, improving internal and international trade.He gives state subsidies to craftsmen to open buisnessesHe encourages the development of a middle-class through tax exemption.He installs custom posts at the borders, demanding that foreign merchants pay taxes. All of these turned Wallachia, from a weak and irrelevant state, into a most formidable weapon which Vlad very skillfully wielded against the Ottoman Empire which threathened to consume Wallachia and all of Christendom (a real risk at the time) almost personally killing the Sultan (who only survived because of random luck), rogue romanian lords trying to wrestle power from Vlad, saxon establishemnts which threathened the security of Wallachia defying Vlad (here is where the anti-Vlad propaganda comes from) and other internal and external threaths. On top of all these Vlad was an incredibly competent knight and commander who’s exploits make some of the more admirable characters in Game of Thrones look like amateurs. Did he do all this through the most brutal means available? Yes. Did he have a choice on this matter? Not really. Things were an extremely dire as Vlad and Wallachia itself were facing numerous threaths, many much much stronger. Was he a sadist, blood-drinking savage? No. This is all propaganda paid for by the defeated saxons who provoked Vlad. The saxons even paid for a portrait to be made, portraying Vlad like a sinister goat-man, a baphomet almost. In truth, judging from description from the time (both of Vlad and his brother), Vlad would have been a very handsome man. In the end, Vlad did at that time what us romanians need now as well. We’re mistreated by our own fiendish political class (the boyars of our days).Our society is plagued by criminals and madmen and little to no proper action is taken.We’re denied proper infrastructure and investments.We’re denied a meritocratic society.We’re bullied by larger (Russia) and smaller threaths without proper action being taken.The wealth of our nation is thrown to the thrash or squandered.Our middle-class and buisnessmen are supressed rather than nurtured. By all means, most romanians not only see Vlad as one of our national heroes but strongly desire for him to return (another Vlad) to redeem us. Personally I believe Romania will redeem itself through the long-term practice and improvement of the Rule of Law, Democracy and Human Rights and not through a Messianic leader, but many romanians passionately await for the (faster) second option."},{"instruction":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","output":"Lies!!

It is an essential part of hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to all tissues and organs in the body. But millions of individuals all around the world suffer from the common dietary disease known as iron insufficiency. In this blog, we shall examine the effects of iron deficiency and how they may affect human health. Weakness and weariness: Weakness and weariness are two of the main signs of an iron deficit. Without enough iron, the body is unable to create a sufficient number of healthy red blood cells, which reduces the quantity of oxygen delivered to the muscles and tissues. This may lead to a persistent sense of exhaustion, lower energy levels, and a reduced capacity for physical activity.Impaired Cognitive Function: Iron deficiency can also affect the health of the brain and cognitive function. For the brain to work at its best, there must be an adequate amount of oxygen. Low iron levels may prevent the brain from getting enough oxygen, which can cause cognitive issues including poor focus, a short attention span, memory issues, and diminished general cognitive function.Immune System Weakness: The immune system needs iron to operate properly. It is essential for the development of immune cells and antibodies that defend the body from illnesses and infections. Low iron levels can weaken the immune system, increase susceptibility to infections, cause recurrent illnesses, and lengthen recovery times.Iron deficiency can lead to pale skin and changes in the look of the nails and hair. Pale or \\"washed-out\\" skin might result from a reduction in red blood cell formation. Additionally, those who lack enough iron may lose their hair and have brittle, spoon-shaped nails.Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a syndrome marked by unpleasant feelings in the legs that often begin at rest and get worse while you're sleeping. A lack of iron has been associated with the onset or exacerbation of RLS symptoms. In some people, restoring iron levels with appropriate supplementation may help with RLS symptoms.Increased Anemia Risk: If iron deficiency is left untreated, it can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia develops when the body's iron reserves are severely depleted, which causes a decline in the generation of healthy red blood cells. Extreme exhaustion, breathlessness, lightheadedness, headaches, and a fast heartbeat are all possible anemia symptoms.Children's growth and development can be affected by iron deficiency, which is especially alarming because it might harm them. Low iron levels can cause physical growth delays, poor cognitive development, and poor academic achievement. To promote children's general health and well-being, it is essential to address iron deficiency as soon as possible. Iron deficiency is a disorder that should not be disregarded, which emphasizes the need of diagnosis and treatment. It is important to contact a doctor for a correct diagnosis and treatment if you think you may have an iron deficiency or are exhibiting symptoms. A blood test can be performed by a medical practitioner to assess your iron levels and the severity of the deficit. Treatment choices might be: Iron supplements may be administered to restore the body's iron reserves in situations of mild to severe iron shortage. These dietary supplements are offered in a variety of formats, including pills, capsules, and liquids, and should be consumed as recommended by your healthcare professional.Dietary adjustments: Including items high in iron in your diet can help prevent and treat an iron deficit. Lean meats, chicken, fish, legumes, dark green leafy vegetables, fortified cereals, and nuts are all excellent sources of dietary iron. Vitamin C-rich foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and bell peppers, can improve the absorption of iron.Treatment for Underlying Causes: A lack of iron in the diet, certain medical disorders, or excessive blood loss are only a few causes of iron deficiency. For long-term control of iron levels, the underlying reasons must be found and addressed. When it comes to preventing iron deficiency, prevention is crucial. Here are some steps you can do to prevent this: Maintain a Balanced Diet: Include a range of iron-rich foods in your diet to satisfy your daily needs. For optimum absorption, incorporate sources of both heme (found in meals derived from animals) and non-heme (found in foods derived from plants).Boost Iron Absorption: Combining iron-rich meals with vitamin C sources can boost iron absorption. Take a glass of orange juice and pair it with your iron-fortified cereal, or sprinkle lemon juice over your spinach salad.Beware of Iron Blockers: Some foods and substances might prevent the absorption of iron. Caffeine-containing foods and supplements, as well as tea and coffee, should not be consumed with meals high in iron since they may prevent the absorption of iron.Consider Iron Supplements: Talk to your healthcare practitioner about the potential need for iron supplements if you are at risk for iron deficiency or have higher iron requirements (such as during pregnancy). Human health may be significantly impacted by iron deficiency, including implications for immunity, energy levels, cognitive function, and general well-being. For problems to be avoided and iron levels to be restored, prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment are essential. We may prevent iron deficiency and preserve good health by eating a balanced diet, taking iron supplements as needed, and addressing root problems. Keep in mind that the greatest source for advice and tailored suggestions to properly treat iron deficiency is your healthcare professional. Put your health first and take preventive measures to make sure your body has the iron it requires for maximum performance. 👍 Please upvote if you find it helpful.

Do they just deny the facts?","output":"Your use of the term “gun fanatics” is pejorative, and is a logical fallacy known as an ad hominin attack, and invalidates your weak argument. Studies can be biased. But the facts of history prove any such studies wrong. Over 100 million people have been murdered by countries that took guns out of the hands of their citizens first. This occurred in various countries over the course of the last 100 years. This fact far outweighs cherry-picked selective studies by gun control advocates with an axe to grind. If you trust studies sponsored by the US Government, how about the one funded by the CDC that concluded that somewhere between 500,000 to 3,000,000 crimes are prevented annually by individuals with guns. Such incidents are virtually impossible to accurately estimate, because many such encounters go unreported because people who use guns in self defence are often subjected to ruinous prosecution by leftist prosecutors. Kyle Rittenhouse is just one example. Many legitimate cases of self defense with a gun are prosecuted for the “crime” of brandishing, which laws are often written without an explicit exception for a legitimate self defense situation. Thus, if you draw your gun, but don’t shoot the person attacking or threatening you, you risk a criminal charge. That’s wrong, but it’s the sad reality. The fact is, gun owners provide something akin to “herd immunity” which helps deter crime in society at large. Criminals never know when they might encounter an armed intended victim, and that deters much crime. Look at Chicago and other high crime regions in the country. They strongly tend to be areas with stringent gun control laws. Gun control advocates consistently ignore this reality. There are some states that allow teachers to be armed in public schools. Such a school has never had a mass shooting."},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"Until he’d lost the weight he’d gained over the winter, my brother ate one meal a day, his evening meal.

Or maybe the Dream Team. But seriously... I think it’s hard to argue with Richard Ludlow’s answer (The Phoenix Suns) as “the most consistently successful NBA franchise never to have won a championship.” I’m going to interpret the question (“the greatest team never to have won a championship”) a little differently. Let’s break it down.Greatest – To me, “great” means a lot more than successful. A 50-win season and a conference semifinals loss ain’t bad, but no one’s going to talk about your team 20 years later (possible exception for a team with remarkable aesthetics, like the mid-2000s Suns). “Great” means that with a break or two, or just better historical timing, the team could have won a championship and maybe more than one. It means at least a hard-fought conference finals loss in the playoffs. A dominant regular season with an early playoff exit is less impressive to me than a strong playoff run (e.g., the 1st-place, 60+win Sonics and Mavs teams who were upset in the 1st round get some credit for the regular season, but I’d rank the 50+ win Finals teams like the ’92 Blazers ahead of them).Team – Not the same as “franchise.” We may root for laundry, but I’m going to define team as a 10-year run with some consistency in personnel. The Paul Westphal/Alvan Adams/Gar Heard Suns of ’76 didn’t have much in common with the Barkley/Johnson Suns of ’92 or the Nash/Stoudemire Suns, other than an aversion to the phrase “but it’s a dry heat.”Never to have won a championship -- I don’t think Clyde Drexler consoled himself for his Finals losses by thinking, “At least Bill Walton won a ring in Portland.” I don’t think it cheered up Gary Payton when Jack Sikma and Gus Williams came back for old-timers’ day in Seattle. And I don’t know if anyone on the ’02 Kings had any idea that the Rochester Royals (same franchise) won the 1951 title. So I’ll define “never won” as “no player during the 10-year span ever won a championship with the franchise.” This rules out the West/Baylor Lakers, because West finally won in ’72, leaving Baylor to win a lot of debates as the best player without a ring. And “never to have won” means we’re looking for more than 1 year of greatness, and aren’t interested at all in teams like the ’87 Celtics who won titles with similar personnel. Loosely based on these criteria, the top possibilities I see are: Jazz 1988-1998Stockton, Malone, Hornacek rubbing his face before free throws, Mark Eaton’s beard, Greg Ostertag’s teeth. 2 Finals (both 6 games to the late-Jordan Bulls), 3 Conf Finals. 3 60-win seasons. Knicks 1991-2001Ewing, Ewing’s bum knees, Oakley, Mason, Starks, Houston, Sprewell. 2 Finals (5 and 7 games), 2 Conf Finals, several classic Conf Semifinals losses (7 games vs. Bulls, Pacers, Heat). Arguably the best and most memorable playoff team and worst regular-season team on this list. Blazers 1989-1999Drexler, Kersey, Williams, Porter, Duckworth. 2 Finals (5 and 6 games), 2 Conf Finals losses (though the 2nd one was with totally different personnel), playoffs every year. Phoenix 1988-1998KJ, Hornacek, Chambers, Majerle, a few years of vintage Barkley, the immortal Oliver Miller… this stretch was almost as fun as Nash’s run, and more successful. 1 6-game Finals vs. Jordan-prime Bulls, 2 Conference Finals, playoffs every year. Only one 60+ win season (the ’93 Finals trip). Dallas 2000-2010Nowitzki and a rotating cast of characters. 1 Finals (6 games, best case among these teams for “we wuz robbed”), 1 Conf Finals. 50+ wins every year (3 60+) but 4 1st-round exits. [Edit: disqualified for winning the 2011 title :) ] Not shocking that 4 teams are from the 90’s, when the Bulls won 6 titles and locked out a number of excellent teams. The only other decade with a similar run of dominance was the 1960s (Celtics), but as mentioned the bridesmaid Lakers eventually squeezed one in. The other team with multiple Finals losses in the 60s was the Warriors, but they had some terrible years and Rick Barry was still around for the '75 championship. While I never particularly enjoyed watching the Jazz, if I had to pick one team from above it would probably be them. In particular, they’re the team that I feel could most easily have won a title with slightly better luck and timing. If Eaton’s prime had been later, they might have made it past Hakeem in the Jordan retirement years. If Stockton and Malone had peaked a little later, they could easily have pulled out the ’99 lockout title. The Knicks were certainly memorable but never felt like a great team, and their two Finals runs were dramatic but also quirky, coinciding with Jordan’s baseball interlude and the ’99 lockout. The Blazers’ peak was shorter, they got crushed by the Pistons in the Finals, and they never beat the Lakers and benefited from Magic’s retirement. Dallas has been too much a regular-season phenomenon, and Phoenix had a nice one-year peak surrounded by a whole lot of fun/pretty good teams."},{"instruction":"What is the most horrible thing you have seen while in a mental hospital?","output":"My childhood."},{"instruction":"Which is the affordable bulk SMS marketing service provider in Bangalore?","output":"Top 10 Bulk SMS Service Providers In Bangalore There are several Bulk SMS Service providers in Bangalore that can help you send SMS messages in bulk to a large number of people.

Most Americans do not think the USA won World War II on its own. They think John Wayne won World War II on his own. I’m only partially kidding. In the US, kids in elementary school get minimal exposure to any history. It usually amounts to learning about the Pilgrims around Thanksgiving, the Civil Rights Movement in February, which is Black History Month, and small snippets of history throughout the year. Most High Schools in the US require only one year of American History and one year of World History, which in most school districts is misnamed. It should be called Western Civilization because they almost never mention anything that happened east of Suez. Most history teachers spend way too much time on the lead-up to the Revolution and the Civil War. Even then, they focus mostly on events and dates, and not many actually try to tell the story. Without the story, history is mind-numbingly dull. The best a history teacher can hope for is to spark an interest in some of their students so they will read and explore more on their own. Unfortunately, most students never pick up a history book after graduation. In the vacuum, most Americans' view of World War II has come from movies, and most of the movies they see are from the American point of view. This leads some to minimize the contributions of the other allies and think the Americans were the only ones who did anything during the war."},{"instruction":"What is the best thing I can do before I die?","output":"‘’Not regret anythnig??’’"},{"instruction":"Why are there different systems of money transfer like RTGS, NEFT and IMPS?","output":"Difference between NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS Fund transfers through the NEFT system do not occur on a real-time basis whereas, in RTGS and IMPS, it happens on a real-time basis.IMPS is not a time-bound service and it is possible to transfer money using IMPS 24 * 7 including public holidays and weekends, whereas NEFT and RTGS are not 24 * 7 service.The maximum transaction limit for IMPS is ₹2,00,000 but there is no maximum limit for the RTGS or NEFT (No upper ceiling for RTGS transactions through Branch, however, for the internet banking or mobile banking the maximum amount of funds that can be transferred per Customer ID per day is Rs. 25 Lakh).Minimum transaction limit should be ₹2,00,000 for RTGS, whereas ₹1 could be sent using the NEFT or IMPS.The RTGS system is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions.

For example, you can go into a niche like personal finance where the CPC is extraordinarily high, but you’ll find that most keywords are immensely difficult to rank for. Or you can pick a more niche topic where you can provide domain knowledge such that it’s easier to convert your traffic to money. The downside of this approach is that you’re getting less CPC for your ads clicked, and your market is smaller. So how much you earn depends on the tradeoff of: How much market size do you want to target vs. how much money do you want to earn per customer?

While some argue for granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants, others believe that doing so would encourage more illegal immigration and would be unfair to those who have gone through the legal process to obtain citizenship. There are several reasons why it can be difficult for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status. In some cases, they may have entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas, which can make it difficult or impossible to obtain legal status. Additionally, the process of obtaining legal status can be time-consuming, expensive, and complicated, and there may be limited options available for certain individuals or groups. However, granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors, including the economic impact on the country, the impact on existing citizens and legal residents, and the legal and ethical implications of such a policy. It's also worth noting that any policy changes related to undocumented immigration would need to be made through the legislative process, which can be slow and contentious. Ultimately, the question of whether or not to grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants is a matter of political debate, and different people and groups will have different opinions on the matter.

The application skills and problem-solving abilities can be improved easily if your basics are clear. So, you have to study with patience keeping this in mind. 1. Make a proper Strategy: Before jumping on to the preparation, you must be well versed with the pattern of the exam. Also, you need to analyse the whole syllabus for strategic learning. It is important to be well versed with the topics and syllabus. On that note, it has been highly recommended to study theory from class 11 and 12 NCERT textbooks along with other exam coaching guides. 2. Clear Your Concepts: According to Previous Year Papers, Mechanics, Heat & Thermodynamics, Electrodynamics, and Modern Physics are the most important topics in NEET Physics. So for your Physics Preparation, you must first clear the concepts related to these topics. Concepts are to be understood, not mugged up. Once you clearly see each concept for what it is all about, you will be ready for the next step. Understand the concept in such a manner that you can visualize them. 3. Learn Physics Formulas: Formulas are the backbone of Physics. Learning Formulas is the most important step while preparing NEET Physics. So, try to learn those formulas daily. 4. Make Notes: During your NEET Physics Preparation, you need to make notes of all the important formulas, theorems, and concepts. Physics Notes for NEET will help you to learn the concepts faster and will also help you in your last-minute preparation. If you are short on time for making notes from NCERT just like I was, you can refer to NCERT notes and Summaries of the NEET exam from EduRev. I refereed to EduRev notes and NCERT based tests after completing NCERT and was wondering why I didn’t find this earlier. 5. Attempt Mock test, Previous Years Papers: Practicing with mock test series, previous years papers, and solved papers is the best way to assess your weak topic areas. You can ideally put solve at least 1 mock test weekly during your revision period. In the month before your actual exam, increase your number to one mock test daily. Physics in NEET is more conceptual rather than numerical. One thing I realized the hard way is that mugging up the theoretical part won’t help in clearing NEET Exam but understanding the concepts would. Just focus on clearing the concept and everything will fall in place!"},{"instruction":"w should western countries treat citizens who leave to join ISIS and then want to come back?","output":"As criminals."},{"instruction":"Why did Dr B.R.

It was not the first space telescope , but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy . The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories . The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls the spacecraft. [8] Hubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet , visible , and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe . Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923, and the Hubble telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency . Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 Challenger disaster . Hubble was finally launched in 1990, but its main mirror had beehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope]So that means that, not counting down time, Hubble has been up there taking pictures for 32 years, 3 months, and 20 days (at the time I write this). Or to put it another way: 11,798 days, counting leap years. There are several websites that make Hubble images available to the public. Hubblesite.org is one that NASA curates. It has 4,422 images in its galleries. [LINKED_TEXT: https://hubblesite.org/resource-gallery/images] [URL: https://hubblesite.org/resource-gallery/images]The European Space Agency has a Hubble image site as well.

Enter Site here. Hubble Catalog of Variables (2019 September 24) Hubble Source Catalog Version 3.1 (2019 June 27) HSC version 3.1 was released on 2019 June 26. It adds proper motions of over 400,000 objects in the SWEEPS field. The proper motion information is available in database tables within the HSCv3 context of the STScI CasJobs interface. We also provide a Python Jupyter notebook that queries the HSCv3 database through a Python interface to CasJobs. More details about HSC v3.1 are found here . HLA DR10.1 and Hubble Source Catalog Version 3 (2018 July 5) NEW DATA PRODUCTS Source lists from HLA DR10 have been combined to create version 3 of the Hubble Source Catalog. See the HSC Home Page for details and data access links. There are approximately 25% more ACS source lists and almost twice as many WFC3 source lists compared with HSC v2. The source list photometric quality is significantly improved. Improved astrometric calibration is based on the Gaia DR1 catalog. Shifts up to 100 arcsec have been correctly identified. 94% of the fields have matches to an external astrometric reference catalog. The scatter in magnitudes is measured using the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the differences from the median magnitude for more robust estimates. USER INTERFACE ENHANCEMENTS HSCv3 astrometric corrections are used for image cutouts and in the interactive display. The HSCv3 catalog is available for overlay in the interactive display. The older HSCv2 and HSCv1 catalogs are also accessible using the HSC Controls in the interactive display. HLA DR10 Release (2018 January 8) NEW DATA PRODUCTS All ACS and WFC3 data that were public as of 2017 October 1 have been processed. The new image processing pipeline fixes numerous data problems, including corrections for alignment shifts between exposures and a better algorithm for combining short and long exposures. The new source lists have more reliable photometry due both to the image improvements and to better tuning of parameters for the catalog software. All old ACS and WFC3 images have been replaced in this release. These new source lists were used for version 3 http://hla.stsci.edu/] [URL: http://hla.stsci.edu/]There you have to enter something to search for; if I enter M31 (the Messier catalogue number for the Andromeda galaxy), the HLA says that they have over 19,000 images. But the search results look like this: You can download the data, and get an image file with the “.FITS” extension. You’ll need an app to open and view these images. However, HLA only has data up to sometime in 2017. A better option is the MAST portal, which has data from Hubble, JWST, and other observatories. But be prepared to be patient when you search for something. A search for M31 on MAST yields over 50,000 results.

Probably the most extreme was the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Astronomers pointed Hubble at an area of the sky where there are almost no stars, so that they could see faint distant galaxies. They took 4 separate images, using 4 different filters, for a grand total of over 1 million seconds of observation time. That’s the equivalent of Hubble staring at the same patch of sky for over 11½ days…all to produce this image of supposedly “empty” sky: That one image contains about 10,000 distant galaxies. So why has JWST not produced more images? Because in astronomy, getting the pretty pictures requires a lot of processing of the raw data.

It’s quite tragic. A horrible mistake made by the pilot who had the experience to know better. While the media tries to sensationalize the story by saying “there was no ground warning system on board” That poor reporting can sum up how they’ve reported everything else in aviation: A blatant lie. The helicopter could have been equipped with the system, the outcome as we know, would be the same. The pilot was flying SVFR and low to the ground, therefore it would have been turned off. If the aircraft was was equipped, and If, for whatever reason the pilot decided to keep it on, and listened to “terrain….terrain….pull up. Pull up.” The entire trip, the outcome would have been the same as well. It would have been going off the entire time, and he wouldn’t have known when it’s a real warning or not. What would have prevented this accident? It’s quite simple. The pilot was tooling around SVFR in terrain and paid the price for it, and took others with him. I live right off Topanga Canyon / 101. I can tell you the weather can be completely different from Van Nuys as the marine layer starts coming over the top of the Santa Monica mountains. The weather was likely getting worse heading north over the 101 (rising elevation until you head down the grade into Camarillo) and this guy was trying to head out over the coast. Flying SVFR in foggy conditions, and low to the ground, in mountainous terrain doesn’t sound too smart. The S-76 is an IFR ship.

Rotary engines fixed the crankshaft to the airframe and the engine cylinder spun. The they decided this has too many disadvantages, so the engine was fixed and the crank spun. It makes for a somewhat compact engine in a linear sense but produces much more drag than an inline engine. Radials are generally a bit heavier than inline liquid cooled engines and produce less HP per CU in (KW/L). Liquid cooling means you can also use higher boost pressures with a supercharger without detonation. One advantage of radials is if you wanted more power you just add a row of cylinders. This culminated in the R-3350 [LINKED_TEXT: Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone - Wikipedia1937 18-cylinder radial piston engine family by Wright The Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone is an American twin-row, supercharged , air-cooled, radial aircraft engine with 18 cylinders displacing nearly 3,350 cubic inches (54.9 L). Power ranged from 2,200 to over 3,700 hp (1,640 to 2,760 kW), depending on the model. Developed before World War II , the R-3350's design required a long time to mature before finally being used to power the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . After the war, the engine had matured sufficiently to become a major civilian airliner design, notably in its turbo-compound forms, and was used in the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners into the 1950s. The engine is commonly used on Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F8F Bearcat Unlimited Class Racers at the Reno Air Races . Its main rival was the 4,360 in 3 (71.4 L), 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , first run some seven years after the Duplex-Cyclone's beginnings. Design and development [ edit ] In 1927, Wright Aeronautical introduced its famous \\"Cyclone\\" engine, which powered a number of designs in the 1930s. After merging with Curtiss to become Curtiss-Wright in 1929, an effort was started to redesign the engine to the 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) class. The new Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 first ran successfully in 1935, and became one of the most-used aircraft engines in the 1930s and WWII, powering all frontline examples (the -C through -G models) of the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber aircraft serving in the war, each powerplant assisted by a General Electric -designed turbocharger for maximum power output at high altitudes. By 1931 Pratt & Whitney had started a development of their equally famous single-row, Wasp nine-cylinder design into a larger and much more powerful fourteen-cylinder, twin-row design — the R-1830 Twin Wasp — of a nearly identical 30-liter displacement figure, that would easily compete with this larger, single-row Cyclone. In 1935 Wright followed P&W's lead, and developed much larger engines based on the mechanics of the Cyclone. The result was two designs with a somewhat shorter stroke, a 14-cylinder design of almost 43 liters displacement that would evolve into the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone , and a much larger 18-cylinder design that became the R-3350. A larger twin-row 22-cylinder version, the Wright R-4090 Cyclone 22 , was experimented with as a competitor to the 71.5 liter-displacement four-row, 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major , but was not produced. With Pratt & Whitney starting development of their own 46 liter-displacement 18-cylinder, twin-row high-output radial as the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp in 1937, Wright's first R-3350 prototype engines — itself having a nearly 55 liter displacement figure — were initially run in May of the same year. Continued development was slow, both due to the complex nature of the engine, as well as the R-2600 receiving considerably more attention. The R-3350 did not fly until 19https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_R-3350_Duplex-Cyclone]and 4360 engines [LINKED_TEXT: Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia R-28 piston aircraft engine family The Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major is an American 28-cylinder four-row radial piston aircraft engine designed and built during World War II . First run in 1944, at 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), it is the largest-displacement aviation piston engine to be mass-produced in the United States, and at 4,300 hp (3,200 kW) the most powerful. It was the last of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp family , and the culmination of its maker's piston engine technology. The war was over before it could power airplanes into combat. It powered many of the last generation of large piston-engined aircraft before turbojets , but was supplanted by equivalent (and superior) powered turboprops (such as the Allison T56 ). Its main rival was the twin-row, 18-cylinder, nearly 3,350 cu in (54.9 L) displacement, up to 3,700 hp (2,800 kW) Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone , first run some seven years earlier (May 1937). Design and development [ edit ] The R-4360 was a 28- cylinder four-row air-cooled radial engine. Each row of seven air-cooled cylinders possessed a slight angular offset from the previous, forming a semi-helical arrangement to facilitate effective airflow cooling of the cylinder rows behind them, inspiring the engine's \\"corncob\\" nickname. [1] A mechanical supercharger geared at 6.374:1 ratio to engine speed provided forced induction, while the propeller was geared at 0.375:1 so that the tips did not reach inefficient supersonic speeds. The engine was a technological challenge and the first product from Pratt and Whitney's new plant near Kansas City, Missouri . [2] The four-row configuration had severe thermal problems that decreased reliability, with an intensive maintenance regime involving frequent replacement of cylinders required. [ citation needed ] Large cooling flaps were required, which decreased aerodynamic efficiency, putting extra demands on engine power when cooling needs were greatest. Owing in large part to the maintenance requirements of the R-4360, all airplanes equipped with it were costly to operate and suffered decreased availability. Its commercial application in the Boeing Stratocruiser was unprofitable without government subsidy. [3] Abandonment of the Stratocruiser was almost immediate when jet aircraft became available, while aircraft with smaller powerplants such as the Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-6 remained in service well into the jet era. Engine displacement was 4,362.5 cu in (71.5 L), hence the model designation. Initial models developed 3,000 hp (2,200 kW), and later models 3,500 hp (2,600 kW). One model that used two large turbochargers in addition to the supercharger delivered 4,300 horsepower (3,200 kW). Engines weighed 3,482–3,870 lb (1,579–1,755 kg), giving a power-to-weight ratio of 1.11 hp/lb (1.82 kW/kg). Wasp Majors were produced between 1944 and 1955; 18,697 were built. A derivative engine, the Pratt & Whitney R-2180-E Twin Wasp E , was essentially the R-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney_R-4360_Wasp_Major]producing over 3000 hp. The disadvantage is more moving parts means far less reliability and LOTS of maintenance per flying hour. As soon as turboprops came along radials were largely doomed because turboprops produce much more HP per lb (are lighter and more powerful) and orders of magnitude more reliable."},{"instruction":"What do hotels do with used soap?","output":"Goes in the trash"},{"instruction":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","output":"Well, NASA wouldn't have to take the pain of sending probes into the wormhole and the Professor wouldn't need to spend decades working on Plan A.

It can result from a variety of factors such as poor posture, muscle tension, herniated disc, or underlying medical conditions. Fortunately, there are several strategies you can implement to manage and reduce lower back pain. This article will outline practical steps and lifestyle changes that can help you find relief and improve your overall back health. 1. Understand the reason: The first step towards relieving lower back pain is identifying the underlying cause. Consult a health care professional to diagnose the source of your pain. This may include a physical examination, analysis of the medical history, and diagnostic tests such as X-rays or MRI. Understanding the cause will enable you to implement targeted strategies for relief. 2. Maintain Good Posture: Bad posture can put unnecessary stress on your lower back. Practice maintaining good posture throughout the day, whether you're sitting, standing or walking. Use ergonomic chairs and supportive cushions, adjust your workstations to suit your height, and avoid slouching. Strengthening the core muscles can also help maintain proper posture. 3. Exercise and Stretch: Regular exercise is important for strengthening the muscles that support your low back. Engage in low-impact activities such as walking, swimming or bicycling to improve flexibility and promote blood flow. Additionally, specific exercises such as yoga or Pilates can target core muscles and promote stability.

In Yajurveda prayers to appease the roaring just-born Agni who is Rudra, Rudra is also called euphemistically “Śiva”, and this has stayed on since then. This is also seen in the cognate IE deities like for instance, the Roman Silvanus/Faunus, and the classical Śiva even with Dionysius. Which is also why the destroyer Rudra is euphemistically worshiped as a fertility god Śiva in later era, to appease him. He is purely an Indo European deity in his concept, an Indo Aryan one, and nothing even remotely similar is the subject of worship of para-Aryan religions. (Brush your “pre Aryan” fancies under your carpet unless you have a culture to demonstrate that) Sometimes some local gods are currently identified with Śiva as a result of assimilating Hindu culture, but they don’t correspond to the core Śiva/Rudra who is Indo-European. The names of Rudra Agni - Īśāna, Śarva, Mahādeva etc. are all Indo European, and are named in Atharvaveda and Brāhmaṇas, and he is worshiped in Vedic Brahmanic yajñas. There is no Dravidian word or root for any of these. Śarva is also known in Avesta, (He along with Indra and Aśvins are on the list of demons to be banished from home) so his worship/renown was not just limited to Indus valley. Regarding phallus worship, it is only symbolic of the euphemistic fertility attributed to the god (and that’s also why he rides a “bull”).

Here are a few potential explanations: Ergonomics: Using a touch screen on a desktop or laptop computer for an extended period of time can be uncomfortable and can cause physical strain on the arms and hands. Apple has emphasized ergonomic design and may not want to incorporate a feature that could lead to discomfort or injury.User interface: Macs use a graphical user interface (GUI) that is optimized for use with a mouse and keyboard. Apple may believe that a touch screen would not offer significant benefits to the user experience and could even be less effective than a traditional input method for certain tasks.Product differentiation: Apple may choose not to include touch screens in their Macs to differentiate them from their iPad and iPhone products, which do have touch screens. This could help maintain a clear product identity and prevent confusion among consumers.Battery life: Using a touch screen on a laptop requires additional power, which could result in reduced battery life. Apple has prioritized battery life in their laptops, and adding a touch screen could impact that. While some users may prefer a touch screen on a Mac, Apple has opted not to include this feature. However, there are third-party touch screen displays that can be connected to Macs for users who desire this functionality."},{"instruction":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","output":"The only thing I am upset about it, is that I still haven't seen all of his glorious tattoos."},{"instruction":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","output":"Today , returning from running on my way I saw a girl with her dad they were running together , it reminds me my dad , when we were lived together at our town place we used to go running together. & Today however he is not living with me ,I m very far away from family, but I am continuing this habit which inscribed me by daddy.

I believe in the below statement 1 and statement 2 is partially true. somewhat Statement 1 Nature believes in balance. Statement 2 (The notion of karmic definition by people) whatever we do, we will receive its consequence in the same manner as things will get balanced by nature. Both the statement looks almost similar if you read the definition but once we start looking at the equation of karma in detail it might start making sense both statements are different and miles apart. Statement 2 puts human/creature as the center of the subject. Cases will be launched through the eye of the subject. Judgment should be passed concerning the subject's action. Here we are talking about justice around each species under the sun and recording of there karma and learning about the story from their point of view. Consideration should be made not just by action we should respect intention too. It is almost certain one might take the wrong action though having the right intention(we don't have access to the future). To make things simpler if we remove intention from the equation and the external environment which affects action it is still challenging to define the judgment. Defining right and wrong itself is a super hard problem. It varies from culture to culture. It is not a function of evolution also. Current wrong actions might be a possible implication of old actions or influenced by the current environment or worse by our culture change. It might be also possible our silly genes and gray matter couldn't keep up with the pace of right and wrong ever changing defination and do things through the impulse that is flowing to us for the last 5000 years through evolution. The second statement doesn't give importance to anything it just runs based on balance. Nature need to eliminate 5000 people .It will simply kill 5000 people whoever they are criminal or saint. Example of statement 2 Consider the case there might be termites or ants in our kitchen will we kill them selectively? cause some insect stole my pastries of 500 rs and others stole cheap sugar. We will not do that way. It doesn't matter they are not important. Consider the case of rabbits increasing in Australia we kill rabbits to control their population without the action they invade our agriculture land. we kill them and shoot at sight. It might be possible rabbits not coming to agricultural land will be killed less as we dont see that sample sets often. But they(rabbits) can argue themselves they are not killed because of their good karma not destroying human crops. Humans are on the same scale as rabbits if we start discarding our self-importance. I firmly believe the truth lies in middle. Nature hardly discriminates whether you are a murderer or a saint when it comes to balancing things both of their act is so negligible against the problem it is trying to solve. It will randomly take action that helps to achieve her goal. Karma/Justice notion came because of culture. Humans have already hacked the mutation by introducing the culture. Culture is evolving super fast(only in 500 years I am sitting peacefully typing on a computer in an AC room rather than waging war in the field).500 years is a blink if we run the timeline for evolution. So justice(what is defined) by culture is more available to us. If we are still thinking I have seen people struggle because of bad karma remember this statement In an infinite set of events, there will always remain a pattern that makes you believe this is the law. We see things that we want to see in this infinite event #peace"},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute? He won’t trust it because I paid for it and he thinks the surveyors are wrong.","output":"Even if your (marked) survey is done on just one line of your property (where it bounds your neighbor’s, in this case), that “line” starts and ends somewhere. These points are called “monuments”. When you bought your property it came with a description, on the deed - whether it was a lot number (which necessarily had a survey done prior to labeling), compass directional coordinates and footage measurements, or even references from and to surrounding properties by some long past owners. (Most at least reference the properties and roads that bound it). Centuries ago, you might have found references on deeds to “the stones by the white oak”, “by the gulley by the ditch”, “half the distance of the width of the creek” or (try not to crack up), “starting with the cow in the field” -which may have been a reference to a sawmill structure. Today, those references are a bit more uniform, but are continued from one owner to the next until they are combined by reference or further subdivided by a certified surveyor. (Sometimes they simply refer to a prior deed’s description if it is particularly complicated or lengthy). Generally, they are not reliant on things that may get changed by building or altering the topography of the property AND one deed should match (at least in some portion) the references of the deed of any adjoining propert(ies). Like puzzle pieces, to be exact. Monuments are the supreme determinants of most deeds. (Even if the property was first surveyed 1–200 years ago, or if it was first designed by survey only several years ago, monuments are included as corner references and are designed to be permanent, unmistakable, AND NON-REMOVABLE. Sometimes they are a pipe (described by details), sometimes they are a chiseled design indicating North, South, East, West, a deeply embedded spike, a piece of metal buried deeply designed to be located by a sensitive metal detector, or an old concrete post, but never just a compass point. They are a physical feature that can usually be located by following the description on the deed(s), much like a treasure hunt, even if you have to poke around in overgrowth to uncover them. Assuming both you and your neighbor are or are planning on RESIDING on your properties, you must also have some formal access to them - like a street that your driveways (or cart paths) will lead off of. Now, in that (or any) case, your surveys are not simply for your own pleasure, preference, or convenience, but they are dependent on surveys done for the roads that allow your use of your properties also. (In other words, whatever the beef, it’s not just dependent on the two of you ‘neighbors’. There are other interested parties also). Your neighbor’s property and deed also should be on record at a registry of land deeds. These are a matter of public record - for good reason. Your neighbor should start there - by obtaining a copy of their OWN deed - if they have any question about the survey done of your property, (although technically it was not done for you, but only for your use & reference - a tough concept to understand, I know…). IF, for some reason, your deeds do not match up, and the neighbor seriously questions the legitimacy of THE survey already done on your boundary, then they will have to challenge that survey with another, AND then through a court of law or other surveyors governing body. (Do you see the interest expanding, here, by this last)? (Incidentally, a word to the wise…the ‘new’ surveyor will not pull up the old survey stakes, just distinguish their own from them). Either way, you are not responsible for a poorly done survey, but since surveying is one of the most mathematical activities that can be conducted, the margin of error is not likely to be exceeded except by some drastic oversight. (Beyond ‘bad hair’ day). Just short of giving your neighbor a puzzle, and a roll of string, and telling them to take a hike, -and hit the road, have them obtain a copy of their own deed, - and yours for that matter - they are entitled to it for the asking, and go over both first before trying to tell you what you can and can’t do on your surveyed property. They need to be prepared to SHOW you WHY you can or can’t do something, right from the start. Just to be reasonable. Property boundary disputes are one of the most strictly regulated court processes out there. There is no room for harassment, evasiveness, repetitive threats, manipulation, out-maneuvering, or playing dumb. This is where the word Civil starts, in law. If you can’t start out that way, you don’t get a walk in court. And you might be liable for treble damages or some other fine if you can’t stick to the game plan of the courts, and answer questions simply, directly, and with factual evidence and support, on a probate matter. You may have to decide how much play you want to allow before you buckle down and tell the neighbor to stop harassing you and have their lawyer contact you - by the address on your deed. (Chances are you will never hear from one). If you do see any new survey stakes go in, do not remove them - but phone authorities immediately if ‘yours’ disappear."},{"instruction":"Why are lovemarriages unstable in comparision to arrangedmarriages?","output":"Dear Friend, See both marriage comes with Pros and Cons….!!

Nor did he write or think about Islam that much. But he does favor Islam over Christianity. For instance he writes in his Anti-Christ (the most explicit reference of Islam you would ever find) St. Augustine, in order to realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:—ah, but they were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature neglected—perhaps forgot—to give them even the most modest endowment of respectable, of upright, of cleanly instincts.... Between ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises Christianity, it has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with men. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #bhkAR]Or, The German nobility stands outside the history of the higher civilization: the reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol—the two great means of corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice between Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The decision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here. Either a man is a Chandala or he is not.... “War to the knife with Rome! Peace and friendship with Islam!”: this was the feeling, this was the act, of that great free spirit, that genius among German emperors, Frederick II. What! must a German first be a genius, a free spirit, before he can feel decently? I can’t make out how a German could ever feel Christian.... Of course just because Nietzsche writes few good things about Islam, doesn’t mean he likes it. Nietzsche would not like Islam anyway. But the reason why Nietzsche would’ve hate Islam less than Christianity is because he probably didn’t see Islam as nihilistic as Christianity. And perhaps a religion that shares less slave morality traits than Christianity. Moreover, Nietzsche saw all religions as decadent, so Islam would not be a special thing to him. But Christianity was certainly on top of his list for the most hated religion. It is also important to note that Nietzsche grew in a Christian society. Usually at that time people were very Islamophobic. A distorted form of Islam was preached in the West. Even out there in India, the missionaries used to preach the distorted version of Islam. So, Nietzsche grew in an anti-Islamic society, yet he does not hate Islam like Christianity. Of course one could claim that Nietzsche “tried to make his friendship” with Islam because he saw Islam as an enemy of Christianity. But I tried reading few of his books, it seems like his view on Islam probably changed (implicit references). Its not that he started to like Islam. But he probably saw something among the Muslims which was missing among the Christians. There was a letter Nietzsche posted in 1881, March, where he said he wanted to live in Tunisia, among the Muslims, where the faith is the strictest. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #ePGkT] Again, that’s because Nietzsche saw the Muslims as an enemy of Europe. But still Muslim theologians are less likely to get shattered as of the Christian theologians. For instance, even the Asharite theologians would not surrender to Aristotelian teachings and would continue to fight on. Nietzsche would probably take it as a positive trait. It kinda reminds me of Dostoyevsky, who disliked Islam (and Judaism) in general, but had found Muslims to be more faithful than Christians or Jews. There’s one thing to mention. Nietzsche was well acquainted with the Christian theology. And the Christian theology (especially prior to the reformation) grew very systematically. The Catholic Church was a well constructed institution. But that’s not so with the case with Islam. Islamic theology grew fighting with each other. For instance, Asharites against Mutazilites, Kharijites against Murjites, Mutakallimun against philosophers (falsifa practitioners), this against that etc etc. In fact, we have one kind of Nietzsche in our Islamic theology. Its Ibn Taymiyyah, who would criticize anything he does not like. If Nietzsche had read these kinds of things, he’d be more and more confused about Islam. And that’s why Nietzsche took a smart step and didn’t write on a matter he didn’t care to study. And that’s why you’d see Islamic philosophers did/do not have any problem with Nietzsche either. One of the immediate influences of Nietzsche was Iqbal. Even, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, who from the traditionalist (perennial) perspective heavily criticized renaissance and onwards philosophers (Descartes, Hegel, Kant) but does not say anything negative about Nietzsche. So, as a conclusion, Nietzsche would not like Islam since he was against religion in general. He did not hold any particular opinion on it. But he favors Islam over Christianity as its not nihilistic like Christianity and less fragile and probably with less double standards “ Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with “men”” Footnotes [LINKED_TEXT: [1] ] [URL: #cite-bhkAR][LINKED_TEXT: The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Antichrist, by F.

Coming after the Pagani Huayra, the Pagani Huayra BC is the priciest Pagani car ever made. Named as a tribute to Benny Caiola, a noted Italian investor with probably the best collection of Ferraris and a very close friend of Horacio Pagani, this car is a delight for the lovers of Pagani’s details. Debuting at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, this car has a wider rear track, new sidetracks, and many cool aero features. Like the earlier version, the 6.0 liter V-12 bi-turbo engine of the BC is sourced from AMG and produces 790 horsepower and 811 lb-ft torque. This power is run to the rear wheels through the tripod drive shafts leveraging a 7-speed Xtrac transmission. And the most amazing bit is that the BC takes over the Huayra by changing the model’s standard 150 milliseconds to 75 milliseconds. At 2,685 pounds (1,218 kilograms), the BC also happens to be a lot lighter than the Huayra due to the extensive use of carbon fibers and other lightweight materials. Originally introduced as a concept car in 2013 in memory of a deceased son of the founder of Pininfarina, the legendary Italian design house, only six of these cars have been made as of yet, thus becoming one of the most coveted cars. This is one of the costliest Ferraris ever made and is based on the Ferrari 458 Spider. Each of the handmade units has an all-carbon-fiber frame and is an open-air luxury car with two seats. Like the Ferrari 458, it has no roof, side windows, and windshield, and is 330 pounds lighter than its ancestor. This makes it smarter and quicker, though it has the same naturally-aspirated 4.5 liters F136F V-8 engine, which sends 562 hp to the rear wheels. The renovated interior also comes with a host of interesting details like aerodynamic headrests built directly into the roll cage. The coolest fact about this car though is that the owners of each of the six models were chosen by the manufacturers themselves, making this one of the rarest of the rare invite-only vehicles. While there has been no price announced for this car as of yet, expert estimates place it at around 3.2 million dollars. Built under Andy Palmer, the new president of Aston Martin committed to solvency and relevance with awesome cars, this model is a renovation of the old Aston Martin-Red Bull AM-RB 001. Legend has it that Palmer agreed to this car over a drink with Red Racing’s Adrian Newey and Christian Horner. Newey, renowned aerodynamicist behind Red Bull’s expensive and award-winning sports cars in the Formula 1 tracks, devised an aerodynamic scheme specifically for this car that pushes air via the chassis, resulting in downforce without using the wings. The 6.5 liter, naturally-aspirated V-12 designed specifically for the Cosworth, has a 1:1 power /weight ratio and comes with a Rimac-built hybrid battery system coming with the engine which yields about 1,000 horsepower. As of yet, 150 units of this model have been planned by the company, and the deliveries are expected to start from 2019 onward. In addition, 25 track-only editions have been planned whose prices can only be speculated at present. Upgraded four times since its release in 2005, the Mansory Vivere edition of the Bugatti Veyron is not only among the priciest cars in the world but also one of the fastest. Modeled on the Grand Sport Vitesse Roadster, this German car has an awesome lacquered carbon-fiber body along with a new spoiler package providing new diffusers, a smarter cabin and front grill, larger side scoops, a shortened hood, and the like. The upgraded LED lights are everywhere – the headlight and taillight clusters, the cockpit. And for the aesthetically conscious, maps of history-making events like the Targa Florio race and the like are laser etched into both the upholstered, carbon fiber interior and the exterior. The 8.0-liter W16 engine of the car can produce 1,200 horsepower and 1,106 pound-feet of torque. The original version could reach up to 253 mph and be named the Car of the Decade 2000-2009. The headlights being made of, urm, 240 15-carat diamonds, is the price very surprising? And then there are the LED blades made of 420 15-carat diamonds. And all the gems are customizable. Looking like an armored car with scissor doors and an interior straight out of a sci-fi movie, this featured in the ‘Furious 7′, and has actually been drafted by the Abu Dhabi police for patrol duty! Built by W Motors, based in Lebanon, this is the first Arab supercar. And it doesn’t fare badly when compared with the traditional European biggies. Apart from its awesome looks, the twin-turbo mid-rear mounted 3.8 liter flat-six boxer can produce 780 horsepower through the rear wheels, and a 708 pound-feet of torque. It can do a 62 in a mere 2.8 seconds and can reach speeds up to 240 mph. Not a production car, this is more or less a street-legal version of the track-only McLaren P1 GTR. Converted by the British firm Lanzante, who bought the original P1 built by McLaren, it was made keeping in mind a select group of buyers in the U. S., Japan, U. K., and the UAE. This car has a lot in common with the P1 GTR and the legendary McLaren F1 road car. For example, the gold plating surrounding the engine bay with a 3.8 liter twin-turbo V-8. It is much smarter than the P1 GTR. Not only does it weigh 132 pounds (60 kg0 less than the P1 GTR, but its modified rear wing and enlarged front splitter join with the dive planes to generate 40% increased downforce as compared to the P1 GTR. The awesomeness of aerodynamics can be witnessed where it is made for on track, where it can produce 1000 horsepower. As of yet, only five units have been built, all of them being sold. Built to celebrate the company’s 50th birthday, ‘Veneno’ literally means poison in Spanish, and well, the design does look deadly. Looking almost like an alien space capsule, this car can reach speeds that can give one of those a run for their money, literally. The 6.5 liter V12 with a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission can spin at 8,400 rpm to yield 740 horsepowers and 507 pound-feet of torque, meaning that the car can do 60 mph at 2.9 seconds! The monocoque is heavily inspired by the LP700-4 Aventador and is made of carbon fiber. The sprung portion is placed on the top of a pushrod-actuated suspension, and the total dry weight of this carbon-fiber vehicle is a mere 3,285 pounds, although it is driven by a full all-wheel-drive system. Only 9 units being made, the biggest problem with these cars is their crazy resells rates- one was sold at 11 million! It was the most expensive car in the world ever produced upon its introduction, and only three being available to customers in the first lot, there was a crazy scramble to get hands-on the remaining ones. The most expensive street-legal production car in the world, this is coated with real diamonds. Yes, you read that right. ‘Trevita’ is an abbreviation translating into ‘three whites. The carbon fibers are indeed coated with a diamond dust-impregnated resin, called the Koenigsegg Proprietary Diamond Weave. This technology transformed the fibers from the traditional black to shining, silvery-white, making the bodywork of this car renowned throughout for its unique design and perfection. And that’s not all. Beneath the coating is a 4.8 liter, dual-supercharged V8 having a total output of 1,004 horsepower and 797 pound-feet of torque. This makes it well-equipped at overtaking semis in the freeway. This car comes with a one-of-its-kind dual carbon rear wing, Oconnell exhaust system, airbags, ABS-powered carbon-ceramic brakes, paddle-shift, infotainment system, chronometer instrument cluster, tires monitoring systems along with a hydraulic system. Only three cars of this model had been initially decided upon, before getting reduced to two, because the carbon fiber made it too difficult and time-consuming for regular manufacture. Named after a famous Italian racing track, Huayra Imola’s technical specs have long been shrouded in mystery. The manufacturer has recently released the technical details of the supercar. Mercedes-AMG developed a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V12 engine specifically for Pagani. The engine pumps magnificent 827 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. The seven-speed automatic gearbox makes Imola more powerful than any other car in the Pagani Huayra series. Some of the spectacular features of the car include a large seven-section diffuser, a large roof scoop, more definite side skirts, a shark fin, and integrated spotlights. The gargantuan wing installed at the back of the car makes it look more aggressive. The engineers developed an exclusive paint finish to shed extra weight. They revised the geometry of the design to give ultimate suspension to the car. They installed active dampers along with a front-lift system to keep the car stable under hard acceleration and braking. Huayra Imola also features an improved Brembo brake package and especially designed Pirelli Trofeo R tires. Only five examples of Pagani Huayra Imola would ever be produced. And each is priced at a staggering 5.4 million. Bugatti Divo followed after the immense success of Chiron, however with exotic and much more exclusive specs. As the creators boast, Bugatti Divo is the most agile and dynamic car they’ve ever created. The car generates 456kg downforce at the top speed. The extra drag produced by the aerodynamic elements has reduced the top speed of Divo to 236mhp, 25mph lower than Chiron’s. With 1500 horsepower, Divo accelerates from 0 to 62mph in 2.4 seconds. While Chiron focused on top speed, Divo offers enhanced agility and driving dynamics. The redesigned exhaust system of the car features quad exhaust pipes and a retractable rear wing. To provide an improved downforce, Divo is equipped with a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car. The car also uses improved radiator cooling for the brakes, which is achieved by two vents, one installed on the bonnet and the other on the front wheel arches. Inside the car, the steering wheel is embellished with soft faux suede. The interior also features Alcantara upholstery. To save weight, the storage lockers and center console have been removed. And a carbon-fiber trim has been used throughout the interior. What Divo retains from Chiron is its quad-turbocharged W16 engine. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission has been retained too. Built by a German luxury car manufacturer, Maybach Exelero is known for its peculiar design and price tag of 8 million. Only one model of the car has ever been produced. Maybach Exelero combines the elegance and quality of high-end limousines. The car is powered by a V-12 twin-turbo engine that produces 725 pounds of torque at 2500 RPM. The engine, mounted at sixty degrees, incorporates 12 valves with 3 cylinders each. Exelero boasts a top speed of 218mph and can accelerate from 0 to 62mhp in just 4.4 seconds. The car was commissioned by a tire company that wanted to test its new line of tire family. Needless to say, the tires of Exelero are of magnificent quality. Each tire features a code, specifying its dimensions and limitations. And to prevent the wheels from locking up during braking, the car is equipped with ABS. The interior of the car is embellished with dark and red leather, neoprene, and glossy black carbon fiber. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero was featured in singer Jay-Z’s music video. And the only model of this car is owned by rapper Birdman."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"Microwaves are a protected, successful, and profoundly helpful cooking strategy.

NEFT operates on a batch processing system, with funds transferred in intervals throughout the day. IMPS is also a real-time payment system, with funds transferred immediately upon request.Transfer limits: RTGS has the highest transfer limits of the three systems.

That’s a feat in itself, and you should be proud of all that you’ve accomplished and, I am sure, all that you will accomplish in the future. To answer your question: I transferred as a new Lower (year 2 of high school) and honestly, it changed my life. Being in such a competitive environment with incredible people who think so deeply, so often, and with such academic rigor, athletic superiority, and musical and artistic and literally any and all type of talent is immensely terrifying and so, so exciting.

But broadly speaking, a pirate who didn’t have the respect of the crew would never become captain in the first place. Piracy was an almost inevitable death sentence if captured. It was only worth the risk for a sailor through the promise of making a lot of money, and an escape from the terrible living conditions and barbaric discipline found on most merchant and Navy vessels in the 17th century. Captains and other officers were therefore expected to hold up their end of the bargain. The vast majority of crews were organized as criminal co-ops, usually with commonly agreed upon compacts. The captain might be elected and replaced by crew vote, or simply be deposed if he (there were historically female captains but they were a very small number) proved despotic, incompetent, or just unlucky.

String theory postulates that the very basic elementary \\"particles\\" are in fact looping, or closed strings, vibrating. The values which the \\"particles\\" we have thus far named exhibit, actually come from the vibrational pattern of each string. Meaning if a string vibrates a certain way, it will have a certain charge or some other elementary, or quantum property. The vibration of the string dictates its properties. Much the same way as a guitar string will have a different sound depending on what key you pluck.Things get complicated when the mention of calabi-yau shapes come into play, which exist not in the dimensions which the human mind can perceive, but function \\"below\\" the threshold of human perception, and unfold reality through upward causation. Which, in layman terms, would mean that there is a \\"piling of possibilities to make an actuality\\". So each string is, much like an electron itself, an \\"object\\" of possibility. There is a fundamental unity when one reaches the ultimate layer of reality. In this intrinsic field especially, all things are one and the same thing. Strings are supposedly but the first vibrational manifestation that \\"sparks\\" out of this field of unity, and endow it with vibrational patterns that ultimately form everything that is."},{"instruction":"What are the best Magento 2 form builder extensions in 2019?","output":"There are plennty of options available to develop your e-commerce website.

It is toxic and reacts violently with water to release hydrogen chloride. Phosphorus trichloride is a precursor to organophosphorus compounds that contain one or more P (III) atoms, mainly phosphites and phosphonates. These compounds do not usually contain the chlorine atoms found in PCl3. PCl3 reacts violently with water to form phosphorus acid, H3PO3 and HCl. A large number of similar reaction reactions are known, most importantly the formation of phosphites by reaction with alcohol or phenols. For example, with phenol, triphenyl phosphite is formed.

I lived there for 20+ years. Lived in northern CA—not the Bay area, but Sacramento and further north. A great place to take long drives if you don’t mind the CHP looking to ‘harvest tickets’ by driving in your blind spot. It’s also not bad if you can find a job. Besides the high taxes and the crime (which I felt the government was abetting by letting people out early a few too often), I found the job market was less than satisfactory. I work in the IT field and, not sure about anyone else in other fields but…I felt people in my line of work were more ‘expendable’ than others. Companies seemed afraid of making IT professionals ‘perm’—they’d hire them just long enough for a project and then buh-bye. Perhaps it was because of workman’s comp and other factors, such as the requirement that contractors *had* to be hired full-time after 24 months’ work. I found a lot of companies didn’t like that so they’re hire for 6 months, or 12. But a lot of my pals, and myself, were being let go after 18–23 months.

We will let you go, wait 100 days, and then hire you back. Are you smiling now?” He thought he was doing me a favor an that I should be happy! California doesn’t have the best business climate to begin with, and it didn’t improve. Not being F/T meant I was lower than the lowest F/T employee, and God forbid someone doesn’t like you—for any reason. Or perhaps they have a friend they’d like to bring onboard instead. It’s that way in a lot of places but it cut especially deep in California. The last straw for me was having a fiance, living in a room share, and trying to get a job with a former boss of mine. I interviewed perfectly, he knew all the work I’d done since last we talked, years ago— except he didn’t think I could handle schlepping equipment from one building to the next. Really? Are you serious? He didn’t say it, I heard from someone via a back channel. I was pissed, because I work hard. At best I was a choice #2 if/when a second job opened up. Well…I got screwed out of unemployment because of a loophole in the law, so for 5 months we were living off of savings and family handouts. And at the time, if you hit 6 months with no job you became even more unemployable, statistically-speaking. So when I got an offer to work on the East Coast there was no waffling. I was done. I moved. My fiance helped drive cross-country, then went back west. 8 months later I no longer had a fiance—she couldn’t wait for me to get a proper apartment and got herself knocked up. (A whole ‘nother story for a different time.) In the meantime I kept adding to my resume, year after year. Doing well now, despite the current Covid-19 BS. What’s different between where I’m at and California? Well, housing is still pretty expensive, can’t really stand the winter (or humidity), but…here I can find jobs. And while still an at-will contractor I’ve found the businesses out here prefer a stable workforce. They may still cut a contract short from time to time but the clients aren’t as eager to cut payroll because they know it takes time to train someone to handle their specific workplace environment. California doesn’t have a welcoming business climate, nor does the state value the middle class, which keeps getting screwed-over and priced-out of a decent life. (Remember the ‘freeloaders’ comment by former Governor Jerry Brown? That’s the general attitude of its politicians.) It’s more of a two-tier state comprising the very rich and the poor—and migrants. The state doesn’t value the Rule of Law, which also goes against businesses and the middle class. So, as far as I’m concerned, California, pushed me out as much as I chose to leave. Which is sad, because the state itself is lovely."},{"instruction":"What are some first date tips?","output":"For men, it’s like chess: your objective is to mate.

The reason these people want to cut the last tattered bits of the social safety net is because they don't benefit any Senators or Congressman. These people want everybody to be serfs, controlled by the rich for their own benefit. American businessmen are just as corrupt as their Russian counterparts, we just don't call them oligarchs even though that is exactly what they are. They gut the budget of our national parks, highway and bridge systems, Amtrak, and they've been trying like Hell to cut Obamacare. The latter they can't do because it would actually cost MORE than the current system, but that's what they want. The Republicans are on the dole of the insurance companies and would prefer a higher deficit than more people getting coverage. They're sociopaths. If we ended employer-funded healthcare and retirement and instead went with legitimate govetnment programs it would actually cost less and cover more people. That's precisely why it doesn't happen. All of that glut of money goes into the pockets of the insurance and banking industries, who pay our congresspeople to prevent cost-saving government plans.

We briefly go through daily tasks on an individual level and start working. I answer emails that delegate work to my team or to anyone external. Pictured: Team & Office. I'm the guy on the right, with the blue hoodie. 11:00: We have meetings to discuss strategy, sales, product development, or other stuff. Sales meeting. 12:00: Lunch, either with my team or with someone I want to network with. 13:00: Back to work - I try to work on some tasks where I don't just delegate, but actually need to do the work myself. E.g: Writing sales concepts, calling up customers or investors, doing marketing stuff, defining new product features, etc. My cofounder and me giving a press interview (i.e. \\"doing marketing stuff\\").

This is just as much fun as it looks. between 22:30 and 1:00: Time to go to bed. :) Hope that provides some insight.

The findings could have important implications for public health, as they might help guide initiatives seeking to discourage e-cigarette use, the researchers said. Although scientists have previously checked out why people prefer to use e-cigarettes, the researchers of the new study noted that the surveys utilized in past research typically limited the participants' responses. [LINKED_TEXT: Best Online Vape Store in Dubai UAE - Vape Store UAE] [URL: http://vapestoreuae.co/] is the largest online vape shop for all brand vape in Dubai. For example, surveys may have included a series of yes-or-no questions, or multiple-choice questions, and didn't allow respondents to answer in their own words, the researchers wrote within the study, which was published today (March 1) within the journal PLOS ONE. \\"What if we could listen in to what people are naturally saying about e-cigarettes to their friends instead of [to] a surveyor?\\" lead study author John Ayers, a public health researcher at San Diego State University, said during a statement. To do so, the researchers turned to Twitter. In the 2012 to 2015 study, they analyzed quite 3 million public tweets about e-cigarettes. Tweets that were initially included within the study contained words or phrases like \\"electronic cigarette,\\" \\"electronic cig,\\" e-cig,\\" \\"vape\\" et al. . These tweets were then narrowed right down to only include those pertaining to using e-cigs; for instance , tweets like \\"I have an electronic cig and it's helping me quit\\" were included, but tweets like \\"I just saw someone vaping\\" were excluded. Finally, the researchers categorized the tweets supported the person's reason for vaping. They ended up with a complete of seven major reasons: low cost, flavor choices, safe to use, can use indoors, favorable odor, quitting regular cigarettes, and social image. The tweets from 2012 showed that people's commonest reason for vaping was quitting smoking regular cigarettes, consistent with the study, with 43 percent of tweets citing this as a reason. [LINKED_TEXT: Best Online Vape Store in Dubai UAE - Vape Store UAE] [URL: http://vapestoreuae.co/] is The Best Online Vape Store in Dubai Selling All Kinds of Vape Products. The social image was the second commonest reason, with 21 percent of tweets, and indoor use was third, with 17 percent. By 2015, however, but 30 percent of the tweets cited quitting smoking regular cigarettes as a reason for vaping. Rather, the social image was the foremost common reason cited, accounting for 37 percent of the vaping-related tweets. Indoor use also decreased as a reason, dropping right down to 12 percent of the tweets, the researchers found. The researchers noted that their findings were supported by previous research and anecdotal evidence. For example, the decrease in quitting smoking as a reason for e-cigarette use lined up with a decrease in Google searches for e-cigarettes as how to quit smoking, consistent with the study. And the decrease in citing indoor use lined up with the time-frame over which several cities and states banned e-cig use indoors, they wrote. At an equivalent time, e-cig marketing has increasingly focused on social image, the researchers wrote. This supports the finding that social image has increased as a reason cited to be used , they said.

I regularly see such hateful tweets from my fellow Kannadigas. I am unsure of the exact reasons behind these tweets, but they often state that North Indians are trying to impose Hindi and that it is killing regional languages There are various reasons that have led to these feelings, as sometimes Hindi is given more prominence than other regional languages. However, I will not delve into these reasons. I understand the animosity towards Hindi, but it's concerning that while hating the language, people have begun to dislike Hindi-speaking individuals, which is a bigger issue. Recently, I came across a video where a North Indian individual removed black stickers which were on the Hindi instructions in Bengaluru metro and recorded it. However, some Kannada organizations threatened him and forced him to apologize. This situation illustrates how Hindi can trigger certain sections of the population. It's unfortunate that the individual was threatened and had to apologize The British once divided and ruled us, but it's disheartening to see that now we are dividing ourselves along these lines ,Hope God gives Sadbuddhi to such people.

Here's a step-by-step guide: 1️⃣ Planning: The first step is meticulous planning. Contractors assess the site, evaluate the crane's condition, and determine the most suitable method for removal. 2️⃣ Dismantling: The crane is disassembled piece by piece, starting from the top and working downwards. A team of experienced workers carefully removes the tower sections, jibs, counterweights, and other components. 3️⃣ Mobile Cranes: To aid in the removal process, mobile cranes are often utilized. These cranes are positioned on the rooftop or other suitable locations to assist in lifting the crane parts safely. 4️⃣ Rigging Techniques: Rigging plays a crucial role in securely moving the crane parts. Contractors employ specialized rigging techniques, such as slings, chains, and shackles, to ensure proper lifting and transfer of the components. 5️⃣ Hoisting: Once the crane parts are disconnected, the mobile cranes lift them carefully and steadily. This requires precise coordination and communication between the operators. 6️⃣ Storage or Transport: After removal, the crane components are either stored on-site or transported to another location, depending on the project requirements. 7️⃣ Site Restoration: Once the crane is completely dismantled and removed, contractors restore the site, ensuring the area is clean, safe, and ready for the next phase of construction. Remember, the removal of cranes from high-rise buildings should always be conducted by trained professionals who adhere to strict safety protocols and industry standards. 🚧💼 I hope this information helps construction professionals and civil engineers understand the process of removing cranes from high-rise buildings. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!"},{"instruction":"the Bible against abortion?","output":"Summing up a Biblical view on abortion: 1. Numbers 5 has instructions on how to induce a miscarriage; this is the only clear-cut scripture on abortion in the whole Bible, and it is sanctioning abortion. 2. Various verses in the Bible say that life comes with breath, so the Jews believe and have written in the Talmud that a fetus is not a living human being until it draws its first breath, and can be killed. Abortion is not murder, and it was practiced in Biblical times. If a situation presents where one has to choose between the life of the mother and the fetus, the fetus *must* be killed. Jesus spent a great deal of his ministry talking about the Jews' mistaken interpretation of the Law, but did not address this issue. 3. Various verses in the Bible have Israelite men killing pregnant women without remorse, sometimes at the order of God. This is once again God-sanctioned abortion. 4. Because God is omniscient, he knows every person who ever lived from before the beginning of the universe, but obviously this doesn't mean that any human being was alive before the beginning of the universe, so why should it mean that they were \\"alive\\" before they were born? Yes, there are verses where God knew someone before they were born, but there is no instance in the whole of the Bible of God knowing a fetus that was aborted, miscarried, or stillborn, because if zygote/embryo/fetus is not born, it does not have a soul. 5. Any person who nonetheless wants to believe that unborn fetuses are worth protecting is free to hold that as a personal belief, but it is not Biblical. It is my belief that the best way to stop abortions is not to make them illegal, but to address the root causes of abortion. Much has to do with poverty and lack of education. I support state-funded sex ed, birth control, prenatal care, birth expenses, health care, food & money for low-income families, environmental protection (which reduces miscarriage), and education including college & trade school. Wanting to protect fetuses but not pregnant women and *born* children is not \\"pro-life\\", but \\"pro-birth\\". Wanting to give access to abortions and not resources that can help raise a child is not \\"pro-choice\\", but \\"pro-abortion\\". Therefore, I believe these are things that rational people on both sides of the abortion debate should desire."},{"instruction":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","output":"That is the thing about exponentials that is difficult to understand.

This is largely because humans inherently have varying preferences and opinions, and there are numerous factors to consider when deciding on a vacation spot. For example, availability of direct flight routes from Canada can be a major consideration, as well as pricing, weather conditions, and cultural activities. There could also be a number of subjective factors, such as family history or a particular interest in a certain culture, that might lead to preferring a cold climate or a warm climate. Ultimately, AI can't provide an accurate answer to this question; however, it can be used to analyze historical or current data to help form a prediction or inform potential destination recommendations."},{"instruction":"What is social media listening?","output":"Hi there, MoCo Venture is a digital marketing agency can help you out with your social media presence on all platforms and also with graphic designing.

That, plus some know-how, you can actually create a bunch of amazing things of your wildest dreams… which hopefully in the future lead into designing more elegant shit. That’s the useful stuff I’ve learned so far in my measly 4 months into engineering and experimenting with what I know so far.

The most feasible option for engineering students after graduation is M.Tech. It will help you earn expertise so that you will be able to get a good job anywhere you want. Most companies look for postgraduates as they are better equipped with problem-solving skills. Although you will get many opportunities after graduation, a master’s degree will increase your job opportunities and give you a placement in reputed MNCs. Getting an M.Tech is not easy. You need to pass the G.A.T.E. exam if you want to get your master’s from a reputed institute. After you qualify for G.A.T.E., you will be able to pursue an M.Tech from reputed colleges like IIT. But how do you prepare for such an exam? The competition is excellent, and you need to have exceptional skills to qualify for the review. Here are some tips and suggestions for you that will help you pass the exam with good ranks. Start early. You will have better chances of cracking the exam if you start preparing for it early in your career. Usually, the second year in engineering is considered as the right time to begin your preparations. It might get hectic to manage college and training simultaneously, but it will be worth the effort. You have to manage your time correctly and dedicate extra hours for coaching. Buy proper study guides for GATE. The syllabus of GATE is extensive. You need to understand each area and then buy your study material. Prepare one topic per semester and solve all the previous year questions on it. Practice more so that you will have better chances of passing the exam. Revise and solve more aptitude problems Revise well so that you don’t forget the topics easily. Give more emphasis to math problems and aptitude as they carry the maximum weightage. You can buy sample question papers or download them online and start preparing for the exam. Give mock tests Mock tests will prepare you for the exam, and you will have better chances at scoring well. Some tests are paid while others are free.

One transfer that captured considerable attention was the GBP 20 million move of Harry Maguire from Leicester City to Manchester United. However, recent debates have surfaced, questioning the fairness of the transfer fee and whether Manchester United made a mistake by initially turning down West Ham's interest in the player. This article aims to dissect the factors involved in the transfer and provide an objective assessment of whether GBP 20 million was a fair price for Harry Maguire and if Manchester United indeed had any regrets regarding their decision. The Rising Star: Harry Maguire Before delving into the transfer details, it is essential to understand the player in question. Harry Maguire, an English center-back, had impressed both fans and pundits with his commanding performances during his time at Leicester City. Known for his strong defensive attributes, aerial prowess, and composure on the ball, Maguire's potential to become one of England's finest defenders was evident. This sparked interest from several top clubs, including West Ham and Manchester United. West Ham's Interest and Manchester United's Decision During the 2017-2018 season, when Harry Maguire was still at Hull City, West Ham expressed interest in acquiring the services of the talented defender. However, no agreement was reached, and eventually, Maguire moved to Leicester City in the summer of 2017 for a fee reported to be around GBP 17 million. This decision by Manchester United to ignore West Ham's interest at the time later became a subject of discussion. The GBP 20 Million Transfer to Manchester United In the summer of 2019, after two impressive seasons at Leicester City, Manchester United decided to make their move for Harry Maguire. The Red Devils were in dire need of defensive reinforcement, and Maguire seemed like a perfect fit for their squad. Negotiations ensued, and after much speculation, Manchester United secured the player's signature for a then-record transfer fee of GBP 80 million. Critics argued that the fee was inflated and questioned whether it was a fair price for the player. Evaluating the Transfer Fee The question of whether GBP 80 million was a fair price for Harry Maguire primarily depends on various factors such as the player's age, skill set, market conditions, and demand for defenders at the time. When evaluating transfer fees, it is essential to consider the broader context of the football transfer market. In 2019, the market for quality defenders was highly competitive, and top clubs were willing to pay a premium to secure proven and talented center-backs. Additionally, given Maguire's performances for Leicester City and his significant role in the English national team, his value naturally increased. Moreover, English players often attract higher fees due to the premium placed on homegrown talent in the Premier League.

One such role is that of a \\"bonus parent,\\" referring to individuals who step into a child's life and provide support, love, and guidance without a formal biological connection. Reality TV star Savannah Chrisley has recently opened up about her experiences as a bonus parent, shedding light on the unique challenges and rewards that come with this role. In this article, we will explore Savannah's insights and delve into the complexities of being a bonus parent in today's society. Understanding the Concept of a Bonus Parent The term \\"bonus parent\\" has gained popularity in recent times, reflecting society's acknowledgment of the diverse structures that make up modern families. Unlike the traditional stepparent role, which typically involves a formal marriage to one of the child's biological parents, a bonus parent is an individual who forms a significant bond with a child through a non-biological connection. This bond can arise from various circumstances, such as dating a single parent or having close ties with a child's family. Savannah Chrisley's Perspective As a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, Savannah Chrisley has provided a candid glimpse into her life as a bonus parent. Although widely known for her appearance on reality TV, Savannah's journey as a bonus parent is less publicized but equally impactful. Savannah's role as a bonus parent began when she entered a relationship with NBA player Luke Kennard, who had a child from a previous relationship. Embracing her role as a caring and supportive figure in the child's life, Savannah demonstrated a strong commitment to being there for her partner's child, despite not having a biological connection. Challenges Faced by Bonus Parents While bonus parenting can be rewarding, it also comes with its unique set of challenges. One of the primary hurdles faced by bonus parents is establishing trust and rapport with the child. Building a genuine connection can take time, especially when the child has experienced significant changes or upheaval in their family dynamics. Moreover, navigating the boundaries of authority can be tricky for bonus parents. Striking a balance between being a loving figure and respecting the child's biological parent's role is essential for maintaining a harmonious family environment. In Savannah Chrisley's case, the public nature of her life adds an additional layer of complexity to her bonus parenting role. Media scrutiny and public opinions can impact her personal life and the child she cares for, requiring her to exercise extra caution and sensitivity. Benefits of Bonus Parenting Despite the challenges, bonus parenting can be immensely rewarding for both the child and the adult involved. Bonus parents have the opportunity to form deep, meaningful relationships with children and play a pivotal role in their emotionahttps://eandeande4u.blogspot.com/] [URL: https://eandeande4u.blogspot.com/]"},{"instruction":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","output":"These days, competitive programming is pretty much the buzzword everyone uses. We're going to learn about people getting into FAANG companies, passing challenging coding interviews, and more. So, don't worry; we'll lay out a detailed roadmap for competitive programming, including how it will benefit you, whether it's required for interviews or not, and other factors. Students who are still unsure of whether this article will be helpful or not will have their needs met by this article. For Learning Competitive programming and practise these questions a lot in Live classes Logicmojo live classes helps me. I was the part of there program also. Let's start by defining what Competitive Programming actually is. What is Competitive Programming? Competitive programming is a mental sport, much like other mind sports like chess or any other sports or games. It's more of a game where you have to find faster, more effective, and more conventional ways to solve an issue. You get better at something the more you do it. It is acknowledged as a mind sport throughout the world, and every year a sizable number of contests and competitions are held internationally to promote it. These tournaments offer a variety of prizes, as well as possibilities for interviews with major companies and other benefits. Just to let you know that there are developers who take part in these competitions solely as their work even if it isn't financially rewarding enough. Starting Competitive Programming: Is It Worth It? Due to its distinctiveness, competitive programming has recently become quite popular, and this progressive growth in popularity has attracted a significant number of organizations and individuals to this sport. After shortlisting candidates from these fiercely competitive coding competitions, several startups and businesses have also started holding interview rounds. The ability of the programmer to solve problems is enabled and improved via competitive programming. Organizations look for applicants with strong problem-solving skills because while languages, frameworks, and technologies may all be learned at any moment, the notion or logic underlying complicated solutions rests on a person's ability to think analytically. Therefore, even if competitive programming is not required, it does aid in the development of problem-solving abilities. Personally, do give it a try without losing patience for some time, I feel most of you would fall in love with it. Roadmap To Start Competitive Programming Learn a language thoroughly, getting to know the bits and bytes of it. (PS: Avoid pursuing a PhD in that language as well.) You can start with any language that appeals to you, such as Java, Python, or C++, but before continuing, consider the code lengths and memory requirements of each, as they have a significant impact on your performance time in competitions. Begin to feel at ease using a coding website with a user-friendly design, such as Hackerrank, and go through many of the tasks there. Why do you want Hackerrank? Your confidence will grow as a result of its recommendation system's steady and deliberate progression through increasingly tough situations. Learn the language's data structures and libraries. For instance, using Cpp's arrays, strings, LinkedList, stack, queue, recursion, etc. and STL (Standard Template Library) will significantly increase your speed and help you write shorter, more comprehensible code. Work through at least 40–50 Hackerrank questions, and become familiar with the IDE. You should feel much more confident by this point, and we are prepared to start competing in challenges on websites like Codechef and Codeforces, among others. Start with lengthy challenges on Codechef, where you get 10 days to answer 8–10 questions. This is especially beneficial for novices as it provides them plenty of time to research a problem and find a solution. Maintain Consistency, exercise patience, and attempt to step beyond your comfort zone by going back to the questions you couldn't answer after each competition. Do them again on your own. If you can't understand it, look at editorials and other people's solutions after the competitions. Although as a beginner do not engage more than 30 mins for a question if you are not able to find an answer. For pair programming, try to locate someone who shares your desire for competitive programming. By learning from others' failures, one might develop their ability to think creatively. Start learning algorithms while participating in competitions; algorithms can help you understand your confusions; yet, some algorithms are challenging for beginners to picture. Algorithms can help you optimize your programme, and they are one of the most important criteria in contest rankings because they have a significant impact on your execution time. You should be comfortable and competent with the majority of the contests by this point, therefore it's time to advance to higher levels. Start by taking part in global contests like Google CodeJam, TopCoder challenges, ACM ICPC, etc. You can undoubtedly rank among the top competitors in these challenges if enough effort and patience are put in. Most importantly, if your ratings decline, maintain your confidence and keep trying. Maintaining consistency will be difficult at first, but everyone goes through this phase, so it's perfectly OK. Let me dispel some common misconceptions regarding competitive programming. Question 1: How long will it take for me to reach the 5- or 6-star level in CodeChef or turn purple in CodeForces? The answer to this query is very debatable. It entirely relies on how many hours you spend practicing competitive programming after you get going and begin understanding things. 2. Also very important is consistency. Question 2: Is entering a FAANG firm like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, or another similar product-based corporation only possible through competitive programming? In a word, the answer to this question will be a resounding NO. 1. There are a few people I know that were hired by these companies, but they never participated in any programming competitions. 2. Some of these companies took notice of them as a result of the project work they completed. However, they also demonstrated a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, which helped them pass the interviews. Therefore, being a competitive coder and passing these kinds of interviews always helps. Final Thoughts Before competitive programming begins, all of these considerations must be kept in mind; otherwise, you may encounter numerous obstacles along the way of this amazing trip.

I find many people want to like french toast, and have this idea of it in their head that it should be good, but they don’t take just the little bit of extra care that would make it really pop. Like just using whatever bread they have around, table syrup in a plastic bottle, accidentally burning it when cooking, etc. When I make it, I start with the bread - a nice, soft brioche loaf from a local grocery. You want to lay this bread out on a baking tray and give it 10 minutes or so on a really low setting in the oven to dry it out. This will help the bread absorb your custard better. Next for the custard itself, I have a little bit of a secret. I will add an egg, the usual cinnamon/nutmeg, but the bulk of the rest of it is just condensed milk. I find it caramelizes the outside of the slice beautifully and gives it almost a candy-like taste and texture. Dip the dried out slices and fry gently to a golden brown in your frying pan.

Just kidding. There's much to that. It can be a little bit daunting and challenging these days to start a successful YouTube page, since the landscape is overly crowded and very competitive. But it does not mean that it is absolutely impossible. There are some tips, a specific course of action and game plans packed with different strategies to have a popular YouTube channel with a loyal part of followers and fans on the platform. It might take a certain amount of time, but once you create a proper strategy and stick it it throughout a few months, you should be able to gain the traction you need for the organic growth of your channel. Let's start with the most crucial stuff. As I have stated above, the landscape is very competitive and saturated. So you need to find an area where there is no hyper competition. It might be called a niche, it might be called getting somewhere first. None of them matters. What you need to do is to ascertain a theme or an aspect that you will be making videos about, where you can distinguish and separate yourself from others and have a competitive edge. Remember to pick one where you can allocate resources and time to consistently create content about. The second is thing is definitely the quality of your content. You do not have to produce videos on Golden Globe or Oscar level. But the race to people's attention is getting fierce day by day, so you have to have a certain level of quality in your videos to attract new people and their attention. Another thing is the interactivity. Interactivity begets activity, that in turn requires more interactivity. You can't just simply make videos, upload them and forget about them. You need to engage with the community you are starting to create. This means quests, speaking to them, addressing their commentary, replying back to them, be in constant contact with them, you need to be reachable up to a certain degree. And the last, but not the least is marketing. You need to do collaborations with other channels, paid for marketing, promotions, shout-outs, you need people sharing your stuff on social media to spread awareness around your channel. It's more or less like that, but remember, even if you can manage to do all that by yourself or with your crew, it needs consistency and discipline for some time to get a good looking channel that will be interesting to people. You can't become Mr.Beast or PewDiePew in a year, but you can get something going in your favor."},{"instruction":"Sophie Turner on track to have the best Hollywood career amongst the Game of Throne cast?","output":"I would say, while Sophie Turner herself is an extremely cute, sexy, hot, sensual, and even erotic to look at as a young female actress. She's already wed, bed and bread before she could make any significant impact on the big screens. It is highly likely that she'd be getting any great movie offers in the recent years to come depending upon her Apocalyptic X-Men Phoenix Box office performance. Moreover, she might need to take some time off as a young mother and a woman to adjust to the hormonal changes, or change in lifestyle after a baby. Game of Thrones: Ended in disaster, many if not most want to forget about the show because of how poorly it had ended (S7, & S8). Sansa character was not the sole focus of the show either, thus her scripts, dialogue, role and screen time was largely less when compared to her on screen sister Arya, or on screen brother Jon Snow. Thus it is still uncertain, whether she'd turn into a highly adaptive method actress or a stiff and rigid one sticking to similar kind of roles / genre. Personally I'm quite not impressed by the type of junkie look she often wears as her makeup. I feel it repulsive (hooker not the expensive kind).

I was then expecting the aliens to send a message to Earth’s leaders: “Now that you know what we can do, you will become our slaves.” Makes sense. You want to make an alien race cower before you? Blast three dozen cities first, then give them the choice of total submission or total annihilation. Then the plot revolves around whether to submit in order to survive, or find a way to fight back. When that communication didn’t come, I was confused. And when the President learned from telepathic contact that the aliens simply kill all life on a planet and strip it of its resources, that’s when I facepalmed. Seriously!? You’re going to use an inefficient, time-consuming method of eradicating a civilization before stripping the planet bare?!? Give me a freakin’ break! If an alien civilization wanted to do that, it would be much more efficient to engineer an airborne virus to kill off all human beings (and much of the rest of Earth’s animal life), wait for the virus to run its course, then strip-mine the planet. Okay, sure. Not as exciting as blowing up cities. And the humans have less of a chance than if those saucers blew up batches of cities every few hours. But not insurmountable in terms of a plot device, and much better science.

There’s this experiment, where lab mice where conditioned in a certain way. A bell would ring, then the mice would get an electrical shock. I know, a lot of you right now are thinking that this is unethical, and I agree with you, the experiment is not very recent, but stay with me for just a minute here. The shock experiment was conducted on the lab mice for a period of time until they gave birth to newborn mice. Those newborn mice were also exposed to the electrical shock experiment. Same thing happened again, they kept receiving electrical shocks after a bell rings until this second generation of lab mice gave birth to a third generation of lab mice. The third generation of mice had the same experiment conducted on them as well until they gave birth to the fourth generation of lab mice. Here’s where it gets interesting. The fourth generation of lab mice were not exposed to the electrical shock treatment. They never heard the bell, and they never get electrical shocks. However, when they heard the bell rings, they flinched. Let that sink in for a second. How is that even possible..? This experiment shed the light on a fascinating scientific concept called epigenetic memory. A huge part of our memory is encoded in our genes throughout our lives. When we pass on those genes by the act of procreation, we pass on the epigenetic memory print that we have. You hold within you, the memory of all your previous ancestors, and you have access to it as well. Let’s me tell you a little bit more here… Our conscious brain processes information at around 120 bits of information a second. So on an average basis, this is our processing capacity. However, research have found, that our processing capacity, as limited as it seems, can go up to 11,000,000 bits of information a second. Ben Stewart gave a metaphor for us to really see the difference saying: “ Just imagine the difference between winning 120 and winning 11 million dollars, that’s the difference we’re talking about.” Let me give you one more mind blowing fact. There are some individuals, who had serious brain injuries, they had one entire hemisphere of their brain removed. So we’re talking about almost half of their brain that’s still operating. Those people, with half a brain, were able to live a normal life. They went to school, they graduated, they worked, they dated, they loved, as if nothing happened. This is all thanks to a neurological process called neuroplasticity. Now that you fundamentally understand the true potential of the human brain, let’s dive into our question: Do we only use 10% of our brain capacity? We need first off to distinguish the conscious brain from the subconscious brain. [LINKED_TEXT: Prakhar Verma] [URL: https://medium.com/u/1069c0d90f97], in his article on negative thinking, mentioned that according to the National Science Foundation, an average person has about 12,000 to 60,000 thoughts per day. Of those, 80% are negative and 95% are repetitive thoughts. [LINKED_TEXT: Eva Gutierrez] [URL: https://medium.com/u/74b0874a8cc8], in another blog post mentioned that: In Bruce Lipton’s book, [LINKED_TEXT: The Biology of Belief] [URL: https://amzn.to/2AE1Dg4], he talks about how the first six years of a child’s life program their subconscious mind. After those first six years, children use their subconscious mind to live their everyday life. They learn not to run into the street, to hold their parents hand in crowds and to listen when their parent says no. Another major point of Lipton’s book was that adults are acting from their subconscious mind 95% of the time. The other 5% of the time our conscious mind is helping us navigate through our day. This means that we are spending 95% of our time acting from the beliefs we acquired as children. I want you to read the previous paragraph again, and let that sink in. In your daily life, 95% of all your thoughts, beliefs, habits, actions, thought patterns, emotions, and feelings you experience are guided by your subconscious brain. What’s even worse, is that we are not aware of this subconscious guidance because our conscious brain is constantly focused on creating the perceptual image of the world we live in. Let me give you an example of how your subconscious brain can be influencing your present state. We all have thoughts programmed in our subconscious brain related to the concepts of personal wealth, income, and money. In a study done on lottery winners, researchers found that lottery winners are more likely to declare bankruptcy within three to five years. But how is that even possible? If you were to receive 1 million dollars right now, do you think that you might lose all of that money within 3 to 5 years? Right now, most of you are probably thinking that there is no way you would lose all that money in 3 to 5 years, however, your subconscious brain thinks otherwise. If you were conditioned to believe that in order for you to live an abundant life, you don’t need more than 4000 a month, your subconscious brain will guide you and steer you in a way to earn 4000 a month, even if you make more than that, your subconscious brain will steer you and guide you towards spending whatever extra income you got, to go back to the 4000 a month. When we talk about the conscious mind, we talk about the creative mind. When we talk about the subconscious mind, we talk about the habit mind. [LINKED_TEXT: Dr. Joe Dispenza] [URL: https://medium.com/u/44f27c714e3c] in his series, Rewired, gives a very interesting metaphor to help us understand our brains better. Imagine you have a computer, and this computer of course has certain specifications when it comes to memory space, functioning speed, and utility capacity. If you were to download a professional video editing software on that computer, that surpasses its functioning capacity, what’s going to happen is that as soon as you open the software, it’s going to take a while for it to launch, and as you use it, it’s going to glitch, and run slowly, and you’ll have a very hard time working on it. Eventually, you end up closing the program, and deleting it, as you can’t operate on it using your current computer. Instead, you decide to download a basic software that your computer can actually handle, and you can finally edit your video, but it’s nowhere near as good as what you could’ve done if you were editing on the professional software. The computer is the subconscious brain, and the creative video editing aspect, is your conscious brain. Just like your computer has a fixed capacity, your subconscious brain also has a capacity. Now what created this capacity? Your thoughts, social influences, experiences, environment, beliefs…etc Are all factors that shaped the capacity of your subconscious brain. Now if you have a goal, where you want to make 200,000 in one year, the only thing standing between the goal setting process, and the goal achievement, is simply, your subconscious brain. If your computer is programmed to operate on a level where you can only make 50,000 a year, it would be impossible to try and make 200,000 a year. Your subconscious brain will create obstacles, doubt, negative thoughts, and detrimental behaviors to make sure that you don’t exceed that 50,000. Why? Because your subconscious brain is your habit brain, and it is very hard to try and break a habit. Your subconscious brain will fight for its survival, whenever you set a goal that seems out of reach when it comes to your processing capacity, you will not be functioning properly. This is exactly what happens when we set new year resolutions. Why is it, that more than 90% of the people who set new year resolutions would end up dropping them and quitting by January 14th? It’s because they were operating on a conscious level, and your conscious brain has a limited capacity. This is the first part of the answer. Yes, your conscious brain is indeed limited in its capacity, hence the myth that says we only use 10% of our brain capacity. When you set a goal and try to achieve it, what happens is that for the first 2–3 days, you are excited and motivated to achieve it. Even when you feel lazy, or tired, you gather the motivation you have and you keep working on achieving your goal. Nonetheless, your willpower is like a battery, and it gets drained. That’s why when people decide to go on a diet, they are way more likely to eat a large pizza at night in opposed to the healthy salad they had in the morning. It’s because when you wake up in the morning, your willpower’s battery is well charged, and ready to help you overcome temptation. But at night, when you used your willpower throughout the entire day, it gets drained, and your conscious brain can’t help you anymore. This is where your subconscious brain would step in and throw you off the right track, into your old habits. However, if your subconscious brain was also wired based on a healthy diet, when your conscious brain fails to operate, your subconscious brain steps in, and takes care of the job. You always use your brain’s capacity to its fullest, but what happens is, when there’s a contradiction between what you consciously want and what you subconsciously believe, then your brain capacity starts to become limited, as you are going through a fight with yourself. If you want to use your brain’s capacity to its fullest, you need to make sure that your subconscious brain is working with you, not against you. I hope this article helps! Wishing you all the success and happiness in the world.

Despite a 42% market share, Indigo had to take a huge loss in the quarter. According to CRISIL, the total combined losses of the aviation sector in India are likely to be to the tune of Rs.9300 crore. This is the highest loss made by aviation companies in the last decade. This is also worse than the loss of Rs.7400 crore made by aviation companies in 2014 when oil prices were ruling at 120/bbl. Let us look at the reasons. Pressure from competition It is actually ironical that despite being the second largest domestic aviation market in Asia, Indian aviation stocks are struggling. The 18% annual growth in air traffic has come with a lot of competition. While leadership is still with Indigo, other players like Jet Airways, Air India, Spice Jet and Go Air with over 10% market share are also chipping away. Tata group companies like Vistaara and Air Asia are also playing a price war. Across the board, flight realizations have come down by 15% in the last one year itself. That is not great news because it means that growth is coming at a huge cost. That has also meant that competition is squeezing the prices to almost levels of being non-remunerative. As players fight for market share, this pricing pressure is likely to remain a challenge. Pressure on costs too While the full service airlines like Jet and Air India are struggling for obvious reasons, the low cost airlines are not spared too. That is because of the sharp rise in the price of fuel. Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) accounts for a major chunk of the operating cost of Indian airline companies and that has been rising with the rise in Brent Crude prices. In the last one year, Brent crude prices have gone up from 45/bbl to nearly 87/bbl. That has taken the price of ATF to above Rs.70,000 per kilo liter. When the rise in costs is combined with stiff competition, we have a situation where the spreads are thinning rapidly. The gap between the RASK and the CASK, which is the spread between the revenue and cost per average seat kilometer, has almost touched negative levels. That is the crux of the problem. What is way out? Like the FMCG companies, airlines also need to learn that price wars are futile. It will only kill the economics of the industry. Secondly, the government needs to chip in and probably include ATF into the ambit of GST so that the pricing becomes more regulated. Even in the best of times, free markets only work up to a point. Indian aviation companies must also look at hedging their currency and oil risk efficiently so as to reduce these cyclical shocks. That may be the road ahead!"},{"instruction":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","output":"To listen.

The place between heaven and hell is EARTH. Both of terms \\"heaven\\" and \\"hell\\" are loaded with mythological baggage that is not biblical. In the bible, the heavens are always plural. There exist 3 ordinal heavens. The 1st heaven is where the birds fly (Gen 7:23) and the clouds waft (1Kings 18:45). We call it sky. The 2nd heaven is where the sun and moon are hung (Deut 4:19). We call it outer space. The 3rd heaven is what you are referencing. It is the abode of God (Ps 80:14). It is totally non-physical, because God is a spirit (John 4:24). Although it is biblically correct that dead believers go to this 3rd heaven in spiritform to be with God immediately and time consciously upon their own death, the 3rd haven is not the final eternal dwelling place of the saved. The Bible teaches RESURRECTION. When Jesus comes back, the dead will rise bodily and physically from the grave and we will dwell with Jesus and God eternally upon a restored new Earth. The current heavens and earth will be folded together and renewed, so that for eternity we will have all the best of both realms. This is what is colloquially meant by Heaven, as in your question. But it should be realized that the eternal Heaven is a renewed synthesis of both the current 3rd heaven and the earth along with physical heavens. Whereas the current 3rd heaven is a spiritual realm only (sort of like a 4th dimension), without any physical aspect. Hell is an English word. You can check its etymology, it came from proto-Germanic, and it means to cover or to hide. It refers to the unknown state of the dead which is slightly mysterious. Biblically the final condition of the unsaved will be the Lake of Fire (Rev 20:14-15). The Hebrew and Greek words sheol and hades are best translated as the grave. Before the atoning work of Christ nobody went to see God. And during the current era (before the final resurrection) the unsaved do not see God and have not yet been judged. Your question is referring to the final situation. The unsaved will ultimately after the Last Judgment be cast into the Lake of Fire. Christian mythology claims that it will be an eternity of conscious torment. However, such an idea is anathema to the character of God and is not what the bible teaches. The Bible says that the lost without God will perish (John 3:16), be consumed with fire (Heb 12:29), wither like grass (Ps 37:2), burned up like chaff (Luke 3:17), go up in smoke (Ps 68:2), be snuffed out like a candle (Prov 24:20), blotted out of the book of life (Ps 69:28). The Bible exhausts the language of death. The Lake of Fire will totally consume and utterly destroy to ash everything cast into it. So the final condition of all unrighteousness is extinction. These are the only two options given in the Bible. The ideas of purgatory, limbo, and other such intermediate places are not Biblical. So, the two final conditions are eternal life in the resurrection OR the second death, from which there will never be any restitution. The place between these two options is before us today- EARTH. Our lives today are a conditional gift from God, a probationary period to see how we will react to the gospel of Jesus Christ. If we react with humility seeking God's face, then we will receive the gift of Life, which is God's own essence. If we react in arrogance and self-confidence, then we will die."},{"instruction":"Do people in the United States actually believe that gun reform will cause them to lose their right to own a weapon?","output":"The right will remain, the government and it's reform stooges can only infringe.

At the time, Apple was struggling financially, and Microsoft was dominant in the computer market. Jobs convinced Gates to invest 150 million in Apple and to continue developing Microsoft Office for Mac in exchange for dropping a lawsuit against Microsoft for copying the look and feel of the Macintosh operating system. This move helped Apple avoid bankruptcy, and the investment turned out to be extremely lucrative for Microsoft, as Apple's resurgence allowed Microsoft to maintain its dominance in the computer market. Another example is the strategy of Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos. Bezos built Amazon into the world's largest online retailer by continuously innovating and investing in new technologies, such as its recommendation engine, its logistics network, and its cloud computing platform. By doing so, Amazon was able to disrupt industries ranging from bookselling to grocery retailing and create new sources of revenue. Finally, another example is the decision of Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to make Google's search algorithm the core of its business model.

There are revolvers chambered in 9 mm, in fact, one of the most popular revolvers in history is technically a 9 mm; but you probably won’t find one with a 10-shot capacity, for the reasons others have stated. The largest capacity in 9 mm I’ve found in my research are made by the Smith and Wesson Performance Center. They have many different models that offer an 8-shot capacity. (Smith & Wesson Performance Center Model 327, Image from Omaha Outdoors) Rims and Rimless Cartridges for revolvers are typically rimmed. (.357 Magnum cartridges, Image from Wikipedia) This keeps the cartridge from going too far into the cylinder, keeping the primer against the breach face. This is also important for calibers like .38 Special and .357 Magnum, both of which use the same caliber bullet (.357) but different case lengths. A revolver chambered in .357 Magnum can fire either .357 Magnum or .38 Special; but a .38 Special revolver is not made to hold up to the more powerful .357 Magnum loads. The typical 9mm (9 x 19 mm, Luger) cartridge does not have a rim. (9mm cartridges and bullet, Image from Wikipedia) There are some revolvers chambered to take the 9mm Luger cartridge. (Ruger SP-101 chambered in 9mm Luger, Image from Ruger) Because of the lack of a rim, the cartridges could end up going too far into the cylinder. This would cause misfires when the firing pin could not adequately strike the primer. To get around this problem, these revolvers typically use moon clips. (.45 ACP Moonclips, Image from Ruger) These clips are small, thin, fragile, and easily lost. They are considered a consumable, so be prepared to buy a lot of them. A 9mm By Any Other Name As previous stated, the .357 Mag and .38 Spcl fire a bullet with a caliber of .357. A 9mm Luger fires a bullet that is the equivalent of .355; just .002 inches smaller. In fact, there are several popular cartridges that fire bullets in this same general caliber (.38 special, .357 magnum, .380 auto, and 9mm). Outside the United States, these are all given more standard names: .38 special / 9x29mmR (the “R” indicates a rimmed cartridge).357 magnum / 9×33mmR.380 auto / 9×17mm9 mm / 9x19 mm Note that ALL of these are considered 9mm cartridges. A .38 Special is technically a 9 mm weapon. The Colt Police Special was and remains a popular revolver, and many other revolvers have been created to fire .38/.357. (Colt Police Special, Image from Wikipedia) There are LOTS of 9 mm revolvers out there, including a few with 8-shot capacity, but finding a 10-shot revolver in a 9 mm caliber is going to be a challenge."},{"instruction":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","output":"Proxy server is a service that acts as an intermediary between you and the desired web content you are accessing.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Whether private schools are better than public [LINKED_TEXT: top schools in Noida] [URL: https://www.genesisglobalschool.edu.in/] is a topic of much debate and often depends on various factors, including the quality of the schools in question, the individual student's needs and abilities, and the financial resources available to the student's family. While private schools often have smaller class sizes, higher teacher-to-student ratios, and more resources than public schools, these factors do not necessarily equate to a better education. Public schools, particularly those in affluent areas, may also have excellent resources and provide high-quality education. Another factor to consider is the cost of private schools. Private schools typically require tuition fees, which can be quite expensive and may limit access to families with limited financial resources. In contrast, public schools are funded by taxpayers and are free to attend, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. One potential advantage of private schools is that they may offer a more specialized curriculum, such as a focus on a particular academic area, language, or religious tradition. Private schools may also offer a wider range of extracurricular activities and opportunities for students to develop their talents and interests. However, public schools are generally more diverse than private schools and may provide a more realistic representation of the world outside of school. Public schools are also required to adhere to state and federal standards, which can ensure that all students receive a quality education, regardless of their background or ability level. Ultimately, the question of whether private schools are better than public schools is complex and depends on individual circumstances. Families should carefully consider their options and evaluate the quality and accessibility of both private and public schools in their area before making a decision."},{"instruction":"Can you ever take out a loan with bad credit?","output":"Yes, but you need to have a verifiable income that is substantial enough to cover the loan. There are plenty of predatory lending companies that follow the “Payday Loan” strategy. I encourage everyone to avoid this at any cost. The cost and rate is insane. Recovering your bad credit takes time, and there is no easy and magic fix. As stated before, the easiest first step is to build revolving credit with credit cards. It may require a secured card, but do not use them unless you can pay the balance before the billing cycle ends. If needing to make a vehicle purchase, there are companies that finance poor credit, but the interest rate will reflect the score, and verifiable income is typically required along with a decent percentage of down payment. Paying down or paying off old/delinquent debt can help, but it typically doesn't have much affect on your score. In other words, your score is not going to suddenly increase by hundreds of points, but it can help when a company reviews your accounts and sees that you don't have multiple accounts that can go into collections and affect the amount of income necessary to pay their specific loan. Collections can be ordered to come straight out of your pay if a company is aggressive enough. Again, time is a factor, and the further away from the troubled period you progress, the better it becomes. The best advice I have is to learn patience and financial discipline. I know this is hard if a person's income barely or can't cover the cost of living and this is when credit is actually needed the most for a larger purchase that may be a necessity, but by this point we have already done the damage. Learning the difference between “want” and “need” is difficult. I don't mean to preach, but growing up without any guidance meant that I made all these mistakes and had to learn from experience. It is very difficult to recover from credit mistakes and the best thing on our side is time. 7 years to be exact, since this is the time limitation placed on most bad debt and it being reported and showing up in your credit history. Credit Repair companies can have minimal impact and over time the cost can actually exceed the amount of actual bad debt."},{"instruction":"What's better, Alibaba or Amazon?","output":"in alibaba you can get wholesale products in large quantity….while in amazon you can purchase single product also"},{"instruction":"Which should I choose, culinary school or an apprenticeship?","output":"Very good question.

I have an engineer friend who speaks Russian (his grandparents were Russian immigrants), and his first job out of college (back in the 1980s) was translating technical documents from Russian to English and back. He lived in Moscow for a while. He always said that graft, bribery and corruption were an everyday fact of life in Russia. That it was everywhere at every level. I have vacationed in Russia and witnessed some of this myself. Everyone is “looking out for number one” and cutting corners or taking a little on the side to do so. The worst offenders right now are the oligarchs, but Russia has a long history of corruption. The Tsars and Boyars exploited the serf and peasant classes, and built up a labyrinthine bureaucracy that ran on bribery and petty graft. The Communists didn't change that underlying culture, instead it was set in concrete. When the Communists fell, former party members in the military and KGB grabbed up entire industries for themselves - because that was what everyone expected them to do. Instead of reinvesting profits, the oligarchs took the money for themselves. They stashed the money out of the country; bought properties in New York, London, Paris and elsewhere; bought massive yachts; sent their children to exclusive boarding schools and lived like royalty. Without reinvestment, the factories crumbled, so the oligarchs invited in foreign companies to build new facilities, many of which used foreign labor (at least for construction). They literally couldn't rebuild the factories themselves. Russia is the largest country on the planet. It has massive amounts of natural resources and plenty of workers/ consumers. It should have one of the world's biggest economies - but it doesn't. Russia's economy is smaller than that of Italy or New York State, because of corruption and mismanagement. The oligarchs are only interested in what they can grab today, so they don't make provisions for the future. They don't reinvest in their industries, their people or their country. They don't even try to root out corruption. And EVERYONE skims a little off the top, and it is just accepted as the way things are, the way things always have been and always will be. That corruption affects every part of Russian society from the richest oligarch to the poorest worker. It is especially apparent in the Russian military where officers sell gasoline and other supplies on the black market for their own profit, and make false reports about how it was used so they can get more - and then the average soldier is stuck with no gasoline and rations that expired in the 1990s. If Russia could root out corruption, as other former Soviet states have begun to do, they could improve their economy, and that would enable them to become a super-power again. But as long as corruption and graft are acceptable, they never will."},{"instruction":"What is nanotechnology, and why should I care?","output":"G’Day Chet :- Nanotech. leads us into 3D printing, where we can print say a new kneecap to replace a worn or damaged one.

Securing a public figure Consider the case below: The public safety agencies of a major European city collaborate to protect a visiting public figure. In the face of escalating threats against the dignitary and his entourage, concerns are raised about his safety in a volatile, difficult urban environment. AI, and more especially cognitive computer vision and pattern recognition skills, assist in addressing this problem by evaluating the behavior and interactions of and between suspects caught on video and security camera recordings. By applying cognitive analytics to massive amounts of visual data, AI generates an extra level of automated insights, revealing negative behavior patterns and linkages in real-time. This improves the capacity of agents on the ground to spot anomalous activities and individuals exhibiting suspicious behavior and affinity in the area of the public figure. Establishing ties to extremist organizations Situational awareness is essential at government installations in the United States and overseas for guarding military posts, managing contacts with local employees who offer on-site services, and deterring hostile infiltration. By evaluating and comprehending radical material, AI may unearth narratives centered on relevant topics. This identifies major people and influences, even those who are not immediately apparent, who may be affiliated with extremist groups or demonstrating extremist attitudes. Disclosure of this information to individuals responsible for safeguarding government sites improves the intelligence assessments required to guarantee security. Protecting airports With tens of millions of annual international arrivals and departures, airport security breaches cannot be ignored. One individual with evil intent and an extreme goal may have a disproportionate effect on public safety and passengers' perception of personal safety. AI can assist airport security personnel in evaluating passenger lists, performing quick behavior/affinity analyses, and identifying potential threats before they occur. This ability to pinpoint risk contributes to a more pleasant travel experience for passengers, and may even reduce security line wait times. Finding immediate insights in massive documents A lengthy text document exemplifies the classic unstructured data type. Analysts are often faced with assimilating these materials in their entirety. Yet, if the important information that is known or thought to be in a document cannot be discovered, the document is of little use.

It’s the perfect day to celebrate and learn more about the 4th planet from the sun. It’s the perfect day to celebrate and learn more about the 4th planet from the sun. Some of the Fun Facts About Mars: 1. The planet Mars is Named after the Roman God of war because of its red color that symbolized blood. 2. Mars in the fourth planet from the sun. 3. Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system (after Mercury). 4. Mars is about half the size of Earth. 5. Mars measures 4,219 miles long. 6. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet. 7. Mars formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in. 8. Just like Earth, the surface of Mars is hard and rocky. This means it is a “terrestrial planet”. You can walk on it! It’s not a “gas giant” like Jupiter and Saturn. 9. Although Earth is much bigger that Mars, they both have approximately the same amount of land, because most of Earth is covered in water. 10. Mars is called the “Red Planet” because its soil has a lot of iron. The iron rusts (it turns into iron oxide), making the surface and atmosphere appear red. 11. Martian “soil” is called regolith. 12. Mars actually has many more colors than just red. At the surface, observers can see colors gold, tan, and brown. 13. Mars is an extremely cold planet, because it is further from the sun than Earth. At the equator, temperatures can reach 68 degree F, but at its poles they can dip to as low as -284°F. Brr! The average temperature is -80 degrees Fahrenheit. 14. Earth and Mars are the only two planets in the solar system with polar ice caps. They are made up of solid carbon dioxide or dry ice. 15. Mars has two moons, named Phobos and Deimos. The moons of Mars are both smaller than Earth’s moon. 16. The moon Phobos is predicted to suffer a collision with Mars in the distant future. It is moving slowly toward Mars and it’s believed that in about 50 million years it will either break apart or crash into Mars. 17. The moons are potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical. 18. Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system. The huge dust storms can last for months and cover the entire planet. 19. A Mars dust storm can reach wind speeds of up to 125 miles per hour. 20. A day on Mars is 24 hours and 37 minutes, slightly longer than an Earth day. 21. A Martian day is called a sol. 22. A year on Mars is 687 Earth days long (almost twice as long as Earth years). This is because it takes a lot longer than Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun. 23. Mars’s gravity is only 38% that of Earth. 24. You could jump much higher on Mars because gravity is weaker there. 25. You would weigh less on Mars because gravity is weaker there. For example, if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would only weigh 38 pounds on Mars Find out how much you would weigh on Mars. 26. The lack of gravity can lead to a loss of calcium and weaker bones when astronauts or space travelers return to Earth. 27. Mars is home to the highest mountain and largest volcano in our solar system. It’s a volcano called Olympus Mons. It’s 14 miles high (three times the height of Mount Everest!) 28. Mars also has the biggest canyon in our Solar System. It is named Valles Marineris. It is 2,500 mi long and reaches 4 miles deep. (To compare, the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 226 miles long, and only 1 mile deep.) 29. A total of 43,000 craters with a diameter of 5 km (3.1 mi) or greater have been found on the surface of Mars. 30. The northern hemisphere does not have many craters. It is relatively smooth. We know this thanks to the Mars Rovers. 31. The southern hemisphere is filled with highlands and lots of craters (including Valles Marineris mentioned above). 32. Hellas Planitia is a huge crater on Mars created from an ancient impact. It is located on the Red Planet’s southern hemisphere and it’s over 3.7 mi deep and 1.242 mi across. 33. One of the most distinctive features on Mars is its “channels.” These channels look like they could have been made by running water. 34. Mars has a very thin atmosphere. In fact, the atmosphere on Mars is about 100 times thinner than the Earth’s atmosphere. 35. Mars has seasons just like Earth, but they last longer. This is because it takes longer for it to orbit the Sun. The seasons vary in length since Mars has an egg-shaped orbit around the Sun. 36. The longest season on Mars is spring, which lasts for 194 days. 37. The shortest season on Mars is autumn, lasting only 142 days. 38. No human has ever stepped on foot Mars. 39. There is very little oxygen on Mars. You would need a spacesuit with oxygen to go outdoors. 40. The atmosphere on Mars is too thin for liquid water to remain on the surface. 41. The atmosphere on Mars is mostly comprised of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases 42. The first spacecraft to land on Mars were the Viking Landers, which touched down on the surface in 1976. 43. The first NASA rover to land on Mars was called Sojourner. It landed in 1997. 44. Two more NASA rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed in 2004. 45. In 2018, NASA rover “Curiosity” found evidence of liquid water (a lake) under the planet’s polar caps. This would be a possible sign that there was once life on Mars. 46. The rover “Perseverence” is the fifth rover to land on Mars. Its job is to drill into the surface to learn more. 47. There are actually pieces of Mars here on Earth! In the past, asteroids hit Mars, which caused debris to be sent into space. Some of this debris landed on our planet as meteorites. 48. The first person to observe Mars with the use of a telescope was Galileo Galilei. He observed the Red Planet in 1610. 49. Mars is 141.6 million miles away from the Sun. 50. If you stood on Mars and looked at the Sun, it would appear about half the size as we see it on Earth. 51. Light from the Sun reaches Mars in about 13 minutes. 52. The name of the month March is derived from Mars. 53. Mars is visible to the naked eye. You can see it without the use of a telescope or binoculars. 54. The biggest planet in the Solar System is Jupiter, and it has more than 20 times the diameter of Mars. 55. Throughout much of the 1800’s, it was believed that life on Mars existed because an astronomer Giovanni Schiaparell thought that he observed straight lines on Mars’ surface. He thought these were canals. As more advanced telescopes were built, scientist learned the straight lines were an illusion. 56. Mars will likely be the first planet that a human will step foot on. 57. There is evidence of ancient river valley networks, lakebeds, and deltas as well as minerals and rocks on the surface that are only formed when there is liquid water. 58. Some of the features on the surface of Mars suggest that around 3.5 billion years ago, the planet experienced huge floods. 59. Of all of the planets in the solar system, only Earth has confirmed life and Mars is believed to possibly be hospitable for life. 60. There have been 40 missions to Mars, but only 18 of the missions were successful. 61. NASA’s Mariner 4 sent the first close up images of Mars in 22 photos in 1965. 62. In 1971, Mariner 9 was the first spacecraft to orbit Mars. It completed the mapping of almost the entire surface of Mars. 63. In 1997, Sojourner as the first wheeled rover to explore the surface of Mrs. 64. In 2004, Twin Mars Exploration Rovers named Spirit and Opportunity found evidence that long ago Mars had liquid water on its surface. 65. In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land successful on Mars when its Zhurong Mars rover touched down…."},{"instruction":"As Libra ascendant with Venus in the 6th house will wearing Venus gems be beneficial at all?","output":"Yes - if you or others like the gems and you are not boasting wealth wearing them.

As an employee, you don't really have to worry about keeping loyalties to anyone if you do your job well. Their job is to try to retain you. If there's a better position elsewhere, change firms. 2) Ask for a raise after a big contract has been landed and there's some budget surplus. A lot of people are afraid to approach their bosses looking for a raise during budget cuts, and that's because of the psychology associated with being a team player. The whole \\"team player\\" thing is a bit of a fallacy, because we're not all the same. So when your company/team does well, take your shot and get that raise. You need to do it immediately, because you've probably seen how quickly things can change in 24 hours. What was a good day can turn into the worst on the next day. 3) Increase your equity. Be the Go-To person; this one goes with point #1. If you can always take your skills and expertise to another firm, they'll no sooner let you go than shoot themselves in the foot. With that being said, put in a little extra time into figuring out what makes your workplace tick and what would make it work even better. Use your own initiative to fill in the gaps between everyone, so that should you leave, there'll be a huge void. 4) Work towards a promotion. You'll never know on your own what your employer is looking for, and they honestly have no idea what you're thinking. If you make it known to your employer that you'd like to move up in the company, then they'll set forward some milestones that you have to reach—how else will you know that it's time to have \\"the talk\\" with them? Finally, if you're looking for a skill, you'll probably notice that each and every one of the above points require you to negotiate. Read: \\"Getting to Yes\\" by Bruce Patton, Roger Fisher, and William Ury. It's a pretty old book, but I think it's comprehensive enough; because once you're done with it, you'll be able to increase your equity, and get yourself either a better paying job or better paying position. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"As a stayathome parent, how much help do you get from your partner when running the home and looking after the kids?","output":"I am lucky enough to have a man who understands the work, time, and effort that goes into raising kids. We're a team when it comes to raising our kids. We have discussed our goals, expectations, forms of discipline for ourselves, each other, and our kids and stick to that as somewhat of a guideline to keep us on track in raising them to be the people we want them to be. Before we moved in together, we come to the decision that one of us will cook a meal and the other will do the clean up after. I'm a picky eater and I'm not a fan of his cooking so I pretty much do all the cooking and he cleans up after. Our kids are expected to clean up after themselves. From the moment they could grasp we would carry them back and forth, one toy at a time, to start teaching them. By 18m they would clean up any mess they made with toys and after each meal. They also helped us with the washing, drying, folding, and putting away of their laundry once they were able to walk. By 5, they were all doing their own laundry. I wash ours as well as towels and bedding. All other house chores have a monetary value attached, based on real world earnings. The kids can pick and choose which chores to do or how much they want to earn. This has been an amazing asset for teaching them the value of a dollar and how to be responsible with their earnings/savings. It has also kept me from having to worry about time wasted on cleaning when I could be spending time making memories. Now, it wasn't always this easy. We each came into this relationship with kids from previous relationships. I had a son, and he had 2 sons. Their upbringings greatly differed from one another. My son was raised the way my two youngest are now being raised. While his boys were raised with their mom and grandma in control. Their dad had absolutely no say in anything. They had never been disciplined and had never been made to clean up after themselves. My husband was used to having everything done for him and his boys. For the first few years we were together things were tough, especially for me and my son. Because we were now picking up the slack for these others who had joined our family and we had added two babies in that time. While my husband would get up for the night feedings with the babies, his involvement throughout the rest of the time was minimal. He was the fun guy. He'd play with them or take them to the park on rare occasions for short periods of time, but not so that I could have a break, but so I could get caught up on housework. It didn't help that his boys were resentful of me for the new expectations of them. This was a whole other issue that would take days to write about. Eventually, one of his boys became such trouble, he was sent away for behavioral issues. Still, the one remaining with us continued to follow in the footsteps of his brother and eventually also had to be sent away. (both are currently living in maximum security juvenile detention centers.) It wasn't until then my husband realized the stress I'd been enduring. I hated what had to be done with his boys, I love them, but there was nothing anyone could do. I ended up having a mental breakdown and that was the eye opener for my husband. Since then, he's been the perfect partner. It's a fact that men mature slower than women, I believe it takes them far longer to understand that every choice, big and small, has an effect on our kids, their futures, each other, etc. I don't believe it takes a situation as dramatic as ours for a man to realize the error of his ways, but I do believe there must be some event to take place that acts as that eye opener for them."},{"instruction":"What does the British word bint refer to?","output":"What does the British word \\"bint\\" refer to? “Bint” is a mildly impolite word for prostitute, and also carries the connotation of being a bit air-headed.

Some of them can be tolerated by some people, some are can not. Pharmaceuticals are like knives double sharp blade. I don’t mean we human beings are not supposed to use drugs. We should use them when we really need them with right doses and right uses. Metformin is an oral antidiabetic which helps control blood sugar and has minimal side effects as it’s taken according to the others. That’s why it’s generally prefered by doctors to prescribe for a person who has insulin resistance. It breaks insulin resistance and make your insulin receptors more sensitive. So.. If a person doesn’t have insulin resistance does Metformin still make the insulin receptors more sensitive and does it cause low blood sugar and consequently hipoglycemia?

At I.I.M.U.N., we follow a three-step approach: Comprehend, Congregate and Create wherein delegates not only discuss agendas but also execute an actionable goal such as planting a tree. You also learn how to connect the dots from the past to decide a way for the future. Refer to this answer to know the best things you learn at a MUN: To conclude, a two-day conference leaves you with knowledge, hence MUNs are not a waste of time."},{"instruction":"Why did punk rock die?","output":"Everything moves around in circles, it becomes labelled as a new fragmentation. Punk rock has actually enjoyed two revivals since the 70's. Once during the 80's as elements of thrash metal and also during the late 90's with both the detroit garage scene and pop-punk bands such as green day, bad religion and blink 182. Not to worry, it will be reinvigorated again because it always sells to new generations. Arguably, purists are keen to point out what is 'not punk rock' but manifestations of punk have always been around with popularity peaking every 10 years or so. I also think punk has had / always will have a major influence on the rock music scene in general."},{"instruction":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","output":"The obvious answer is that you cannot fold a piece of paper 103 times. Let’s consider what this protocol means. If you fold it once, the height of the folded paper would be two sheets. If you fold again, it becomes 4. So, 103 foldings would produce a thickness of [math]2^{103}[/math]=1.0E+31 If you measure a sheet of paper, you might get a thickness of 0.1 mm or 1E-4 meters. So, the thickness of the 103 folder sheet would be 1E-26 meters or 10,570,008,340 so, 10.6 GLY. GLY is giga light years or 1E9 light-years. The Universe is 13.8 GLY, so this is not correct. If you fold it 104, then the thickness will be 21.2 GLY…:) and that will be larger than the observable Universe. So, don’t try to do it at home, kids…:)"},{"instruction":"Can you check phase rotation with a multimeter?","output":"No, you cannot check phase rotation with a multimeter alone. Phase rotation refers to the sequence in which the voltage waveforms of a three-phase electrical system reach their peak values. The correct phase rotation is important for the proper functioning of three-phase equipment and motors. While a multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance, it cannot determine the phase rotation of a three-phase electrical system. To check the phase rotation, specialized tools such as a phase rotation meter or a motor rotation tester are required. A phase rotation meter is a device that can measure the phase sequence of a three-phase system by connecting to the three-phase power source and indicating the phase rotation sequence with LEDs or a digital display. A motor rotation tester is a device used to determine the direction of rotation of a motor by temporarily connecting it to the motor leads and observing the direction of rotation. It is important to verify the phase rotation of a three-phase electrical system to ensure that the equipment operates correctly and safely."},{"instruction":"Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?","output":"They are bred to run.

As part of my experience, and I believe from many other blind programmers, the way that we program is not that different from our sighted colleagues. I use most of the time a text editor (which is emacs and an extension called emacspeak, which makes emacs talk), and a browser to look some internal pages of Google with documentation and stuff. The main difference here is that we either hear what is on the screen, or read with the help of a braille display. I can not comment on using a braille display because I have never had one in my life (too expensive), but I can give some idea how is to program just hearing. The biggest challenge of programming just by ear is that you need to memorize a lot of stuff. You move line by line, hearing the entire line. You can move word by word and hear them, or character by character. The point is, you see, at a given time, just a small fraction of what is on the screen. You can't start programming, look up in the function definition what is the name of the variable being passed. You memorize it. If you want to check the function definition, again, I would set a marker, look for the definition, read it, and come back. As you can notice, this may take a few precious seconds, so improving your memory skills is a good thing here. I like to program with emacspeak because it gives me a lot of cool things when programming in c++, for example. In this program there is the notion of voice styles, and it will read variables, functions and different element of the language with a voice with a different pitch. This makes things easier to identify what is what. consider this as the audio highlighting of code. As a last comment, a curiosity:Blind programmers do not use indentation. We normally finish the code and indent it later, as it brings no advantage for us.then you might ask:what about python?I like python a lot, and even the indentation part does not make me thing differently. I create some techniques, like, jump a line at the end of each indentation block, so I can know very fast when the block has ended. When reading code from others, I can set an option in my screen reader to tell the indentation level, but I find this a little bit annoying, because for each line that you read, it will say the number of spaces present on that line."},{"instruction":"Which countries were Portuguese colonies?","output":"Poland and Egypt"},{"instruction":"Can whiskers replace the sensory organs?","output":"Whiskers ARE a sensory organ. As to whether they can replace organs such as eyes and ears, well… how long do you have? Many insects use their antennae as either eyes, ears or nose. I’ll dismiss the idea of ‘smelling’ with whiskers since that wouldn’t work for a hair-like whisker without serious adaptations, but whiskers that are fine enough can be sensitive to vibrations, giving a rudimentary form of hearing. They can also, naturally, be used to ‘feel around’, thus replacing sight over short distances. That being said, whiskers are never going to be as good as the equivalent specialised organ without being specialised themselves, and by then, they are no longer what we’d call ‘whiskers’."},{"instruction":"w many countries have you travelled to and which are they?","output":"I live in India 🇮🇳 I have been to 3 countries till date , China 🇨🇳 Chinese people are really nice , they are mostly kind , but expect little racism here .Infrastructure in China is way more advanced than India .Chinese people are also hard workers .I have seen many of us hating Chinese , they don’t hate Indians .

A pitched ball is typically rotating when it hits the dirt, which hits tiny pebbles or simply dirt that's not soft in a way that can cause scuffs. A batted ball doesn't [usually] result in a scuff, but you'll see us change them out when we can tell a ball might be scuffed, such as the ball being hit off the end of the bat [which can often be a cupped end of the bat]. Many balls you see switched out are still used later in the game, but we're not going to sit there and check the ball while everyone waits in a game where pace of play is being debated non-stop. Much easier to switch it out quickly, and then check it on your own time while still keeping the game moving. At the MLB level this means just giving it to the ball boy, but… never underestimate the added revenue to a big league ball club in selling game-used baseballs in their team store, lol. It's always cooler to catch one yourself, but not everyone gets that opportunity."},{"instruction":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","output":"Okay this answer might cause a bit of controversy but it does answer the question so here goes. What do you think of when you see the picture below? A house vent for warm heat in the winter and cool air in the summers, right? Wrong! At least not in my house growing up! We called this the the Math Torture Vent. My mom used to make me kneel on it while I memorized my multiplication table up to 12x, when I was five years old. If I lost focus and didn’t rehearse quickly enough, my knee caps would start bleeding. We used to play this math game in elementary school where students would go head-to-head to see who could answer multiplication questions first. The winner would go onto the next person, like the math version of king’s court. This is literally the one game in grade school that I never lost, my mom made sure of that. My parents fled to Canada during the Vietnam war. They were poor, spoke no English and were uneducated. Their hard nosed, traditional East Asian parenting style is one of the few things they were able to take with them onto the escape boat. So it’s hard for me to blame them for it, given the hell they went through to ensure their kids were safe and had an opportunity at a fair life. Was it the best way to teach a child mathematics? Hell to the no! Was it the most loving way to teach a child? Not one bit! Would it be considered borderline abuse in 2018? Probably. The question however is, ‘What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?’ Was it creative? I’d say so."},{"instruction":"Should I eat McDonald's or Burger King?","output":"When it comes to choosing between McDonald's and Burger King, there is no right or wrong answer.

My Goal: “I’m going to be the first World Bodybuilding & Fitness Federation’s Teen Fitness Model.” What Happened: I became too insecure to follow through. When I moved into the college dorms, I brought a big blue bin of food with me. It contained canned tuna, oats, raisins, protein bars, protein powder, microwavable brown rice and shaker cups. Well, it turned out one meal of canned tuna was enough to stink up the entire floor of my dorm. People told me I was “too extreme,” “not big enough,” and “weird.” And I believed them. My enthusiasm for fitness was replaced with a need for acceptance, which led me to Greek Life. March 1, 2014: I’m 19 years old. My Goal: “I’m going to raise my social status so I can gain the respect of my peers and the admiration of women (i.e.: sex).” What Happened: I publicly failed at an attempt to lead. My fraternity became my identity. I joined the leadership team and served for two terms as the Vice President of Finance and the President. I craved purpose, and I found it in leading my friends. And then I failed. I tried to eliminate hazing from our new membership program. The chapter wasn’t bought-in to the idea, and my well-intentioned initiative backfired in my face. I became depressed, isolated and stepped down as President with 6 months left in my term. This public failure caused me an immense amount of pain. I turned to Personal Development for answers on how to find happiness, passion and purpose. April 5, 2015: I’m 20 years old. My Goal: Discover my Life’s Purpose. What Happened: My search for answers turned into an obsessive, drug-induced spiritual journey. At this point, my identity was stripped of fitness and fraternity. So I took on the persona of The Learner—always reading, studying and trying to better myself. Ironically, this led me to Psychedelic Drugs. I experimented with LSD and Magic Mushrooms on multiple occasions, with plenty of Marijuana to pass the time in-between “trips.” My motivation for experimentation was to uncover the answer for my existence. Instead, I became hyper-aware of my mortality. With death always top of mind, I grew paranoid about what I focused and worked on. After five unfulfilling weeks spent cold-calling small businesses pitching payment processing, I quit because I felt like I was wasting my time—and ultimately, my life. I began searching for the answer to this question: How can I create a life on my own terms? This led me to Internet Marketing. June 27, 2016: I’m 21 years old. My Goal: Make money online. What Happened: I tried and failed, which led me to a life-altering opportunity. I’ve always enjoyed writing, so I wrote a few blog posts for a friend’s website. He paid me 100. The piece took me 8 hours. Not scaleable. So, I tried to create a video ad to sell an information product about how to write blog posts (that’s what this image is about). This too failed because I had no idea what I was doing—and no experience to back up my advice. Then I tried blogging about self-development. It was going well and it was fun, but I wasn’t making any money. With graduation only two months away, I needed to line-up a job. I spent an entire Sunday applying for sales jobs in San Francisco I didn’t want to interview for. And just before closing my laptop and calling it a day, I decided to scroll through Facebook. Then I saw it. A mutual friend with a successful online business needed an intern. I applied, and within a week I was brought on for a 60-day trial period. I was hired full-time two months later. June 18, 2017: I’m 22 years old. My Goal: Adventure. What’s Happening: I’m on an indefinite trip around the world getting uncomfortable in the name of personal growth. My job is 100% remote, so I’m blessed with the autonomy to travel while working.

See end If you strike out once, do you stop playing the game or yell at the referee? When I was flying, I was often told from a tactical point of view, “Mistakes are human but don’t let a mistake turn into an error. Keep flying the airplane.” You hear the same thing in performance art. Make a mistake, keep going. Many might not notice but if you make a face… Many talk about the Kobayashi Maru like it’s a puzzle. As if there is this perfect solution. It’s a sim. The simulation will adapt to your particular choices. You’re thrown a curve ball, do you keep going and work the problem or do you throw up your hands and give up? “Maintaining situational awareness and avoiding task saturation” is one technical way of putting it. Let’s remember, Savik passed the Kobayashi Maru test first time. After a failed attempt, Troi passed the Bridge Officer Examination . Crusher passed the psych eval on the first try. Kirk passed the Kobayashi Maru test three times.

I’m sure the AI adapted to Kirk’s actions. I always imaged Kirk learned up on AI and “gamed the sim” like a chess game. Not unlike Captain Georgiou. Oh Phillipa. Why you gotta be so mean? Why do I think that? “Computer, this is a Class A directive” Star Trek Discovery: S4E01 Makes explicit the point. I won’t spoil it.

Plus in America, scams are of gigantic proportions and at very high levels, nations are involved in wars, govt policies are changed for benefits of some corporate. What are political donations to Presidential and other candidates? Only difference is that here, corruption pinches and affects common people, while there, it does not. Of course in recent times, lots of it has been either eliminated or reduced greatly due to digital route, so much that normal points of bribery, like railway tickets, RTO, Ration cards (for APL) Passport etc, are by and large corruption free. Even property registration is online, etc, govt is sincerely trying but still there is a very long way to go. See the practice of Nazarana and Peshagi is deep rooted and ancient in our culture. Nazarana is a gift you take when you go to see a big man, just because he has deemed it fit to meet you, without any expectation, and Peshagi is when you meet a big, influential person for getting some work done, you take appropriate gift, in the hope that your work will be done. Current corruption has crept as inheritor of these two old traditions."},{"instruction":"w do you deliver effective communication?","output":"My husband, my daughter and I flew back to our home in Germany after an amazing family reunion in China on 4th January this year. We were exhausted. I managed to call my parents when we changed our flight in Paris. They were on their way home and we talked a little on the phone. I said I would call them as soon as we arrived in Munich. Several hours later we arrived our home. I called my mom first. She didn’t answer. Then I called my dad. My dad was as calm as usual. He asked me how was the flight und told me to go to bed with my family and have a nice sleep. And everything is all right with them. As I didn’t speak to my mom, I messaged her. Just how delicious the food she gave to me for the flight was. We slept more than 10 hours after that. My mom didn’t answer my messages which was really strange. I called my dad and asked where my mom was. He said she went to visit her best girl friend. And we talked a little about my daughter and my dad was calm and caring as usual. I called my dad the following day again because there was still no message from my mom. My dad said my mom had a little car accident just in front our house. She was still in coma but she is not in deadly peril. And that I should stay with my family in Germany. And he will definitely keep me to date. And if my mother’s condition worsens, he will let me know as soon as possible and I can take the next flight. On the following days I was terribly sad but not devastated. My dad was always so optimistic and calm on the phone. He told me about every little progress my mom made. I was worried because she still didn’t wake up. But I managed to function for everyday life, including taking care of our little daughter and so on. I flied back to China several days later after I arranged everything I could think of. Day care for my daughter, my work etc. I was calm and definitely didn’t lose my balance during the flight. In China I got to know that my mother had the accident when we were still in Paris, just several minutes after we talked on the phone. She was operated on the same day because of severe brain bleeding. Two days after my arrival my mom opened her eyes. And It was a really long process for my mom to regain consciousness. But now, about 5 months later, with great and selfless support of my aunty, my dad and my other familiy members, my mother is not only still alive, but she can also walk and speak and remember everything before the accident. My dad told me that my mother could have died. But It’s still way too dangerous for him to tell me the full truth. Because of the distance I could do nothing to help my mother but only cause damage to myself and my two year old daughter in my desperation if I‘ve got to know the full truth. So my dad tried everything to be optimistic and calm when he spoke with me during the most difficult time. Some other people said my dad should have told me the full truth because I‘m an adult and should make decision by myself. But what I know is that my dad did everything for my safety and out of great love."},{"instruction":"Did you ever think that if you could convince 1 million people to give you only 1 miserable dollar you would become a millionaire?","output":"That is exactly how everyone becomes rich! All rich like Gates, Bezos and Jobs actually figured out a way to accomplish that. Rich companies like Coca-cola, Amazon, Apple all do that. Most people seem to think that millions or billions just materialize. That is not true. To be a billionaire, you sell 1 dollar items a billion times. Look at this piece of news - big bucks are made by repeating small bucks. A man in Chicago named Libman started making corn wired brooms. He made a company to “make highest quality brooms”. His family is super rich, from selling 1 dollar corn brooms. He has been doing this for 120 years. There is a town called Fleichmann, New York.

This is one of the most important factors in Artificial Intelligence as it is the one that covers the communication part of computers to humans. As Alan Turing said - A computer will deserve to be called intelligent when it can deceive a human into believing that it was human. Now, coming to the main NLP techniques that every data scientist must know. According to me, these NLP techniques would be - TokenizationStemming and LemmatizationStop Words RemovalTF-IDFKeyword ExtractionWord EmbeddingsSentiment AnalysisTopic ModelingText Summarization, andNamed Entity Recognition If you want to be a data scientist who covers all his bases and knows not only the different kinds of NLP techniques but also has practical experience to back up his knowledge then my suggestion to you is to pursue a good data science course that will help you out in the same. In order to understand what a good data science course is first you must know about the essential features expected out of a good data science course. A good data science course will offer you the following features - Affordable course fee and high ROIClasses in the mode of live sessionsDoubt clearing sessions to clear concepts of studentsPractical experience in the form of capstone projects and real-life projectsWell structured course provided by experienced mentors, andPlacement assistance When you choose a data science course for yourself, my suggestion to you is to keep these factors in mind while choosing the same. My suggestion to you for a data science course is Tutort Academy. The course offered by Tutort Academy will provide you with not only all the important factors that I have mentioned above but will include other additional factors as well. The data science course of Tutort Academy was made keeping in mind the needs of working professionals and the problems faced by them, therefore, there is a special feature called the Flexible Pass available to the students. This feature helps the working professionals in order to manage their jobs with their classes. The same is done through two benefits of the Flexible Pass. These two benefits are - The students are given lifetime access to an LMS platform that has the recorded sessions of all the classes, andAccess to the live classes of other batches is also provided so that the students can also participate in the discussion of the interactive live sessions (NOTE:— many institutes have only recorded sessions if a student misses out on their classes. While these do help, they do not provide the student with all the benefits that he would otherwise have had. As working professionals often face issues due to their jobs, this feature is very beneficial to them and also helps them get a live interactive class) Many institutes also face problems regarding the return and refund policy. And there are often situations where the student feels that they do not want to continue with their online classes as they are not comfortable with the mode of education (even though they are live sessions). Therefore, in order to help these students out with this problem, Tutort Academy offers a 100% money-back guarantee on its courses for 14 days since the beginning of the course. Not only is it a total refund of your amount if you do not want to continue with the course, but you will also be able to attend a few classes and get to see if you are comfortable with the same. (NOTE:—this 100% money-back guarantee is a special feature provided by Tutort Academy considering the problems faced by the students in the different cases involving refund situations where they do not want to continue with the classes) Some other special features offered by Tutort Academy are - A small batch size of around 35 students to avoid any chaos in the classWarm-up session in programming and statistics The different tools covered in this course include - RPythonPower BITableauMongoDBMy SQL, andAWS The course includes not only multiple features, important NLP techniques, and other tools, but will also provide you with important career guidance from the best mentors who are experienced from the top MNCs like Amazon, Microsoft, JPMC, and others. Therefore, my advice to you is to opt for the data science course offered by Tutort Academy and visit their website to look into the course material and features at large.

Here I am not only telling you about 12 best sources of protein for vegetarians but also about at what quantity one can deliver that food source to fulfill the daily requirement of proteins. 1. Milk: It is studied as a complete form of protein which means it contains all the essential amino acids (usually called the first class of protein). I constantly recommend having low fat (Double toned) or skimmed milk. If someone is lactose intolerant, then one should avoid milk. 2. Dahi: It is considered as a complete form of protein which means it bears all the essential amino acids (usually called the first class of protein). I always advocate having low fat (Double toned) or skimmed milk. If someone is lactose intolerant, then one should avoid dahi. 3. Cheese: Cheese is a dairy-based derived from milk that’s produced during a wide selection of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. One of the other high sources of protein contains all the essential amino acids. Still, my recommendation to look for low-fat cheese brands like Britania slims. 4. Dal/Lentil: It is the most important staple food in India cooked in everyone’s home daily some of them are yellow mung dal, green mung dal, urad dal, Channa dal, Toor dal, Masoor dal, etc. It is high in protein but lacks amino acids like methionine and cysteine. If dal can be combined with grains like roti, brown bread, oats, etc., which is high in methionine and cysteine, then one can take advantage of the complete protein meal. 5. Paneer: It is also known as cottage cheese in western counties. It is made up of milk, i.e. can be from low-fat milk or full cream milk but usually in India panner is produced up of full cream milk. Brand who sells paneer is Amul, mother dairy, paras, Ananda & gopaljee, etc. 6. Tofu: It is also known as soya paneer which is made by coagulating soy milk (change from a liquid to a thickened or solid-state) and pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. It is high in protein and very low in fat & carbohydrates. Brands who sell tofu in India are so-lite tofu, soffit tofu supreme, margins tofu, Diet tofu, etc. 7. Beans: One of the frequently used food in India regularly name safedchanna(chickpeas), Kala chana(brown chickpeas), rajma(kidney beans) & lobhia/raungi(black-eyed peas). Beans are high in protein, thus lack in amino acid-like tryptophan and methionine. If beans can combine with grains like rice, etc. When beans and rice are combined, however, the amino acid profile is balanced. 8. Soya Chop: Again another high food source of protein being vegetarian which is made up of soya beans contains a very high amount of protein. In India, we usually get chops in local vendors, but that is not a pure soya chop it contains Maida (refined wheat flour).

Originally a vassal state of Hungary, Wallachia broke its allegiance in 1330 during the reign of Basarab I (r. 1310–42), after a successful war against Hungary. The new principality prospered from its rich agricultural development and from the flow of trade passing through it between northern Europe and the Black Sea. It faced dangers from Hungary, which tried to restore its domination, as well as from the Ottoman Turks, who steadily extended their control over the Balkan Peninsula during the 14th century. In 1417 Wallachia was compelled to pay tribute and grant trade concessions to the Ottoman Empire. Neverthless, numerous princes continued Walachia’s resistance to the Ottoman rule, most notably, Vlad III (reigned 1448, 1456–62, and 1476–77) and Michael the Brave (reigned 1593–1601)."},{"instruction":"Why haven't the Las Vegas casinos been completely destroyed by mathematicians?","output":"Because almost all of the ways that they make money are not vulnerable (or rather easily vulnerable) to purely mathematical exploits. Lots of people have mentioned card counting in their answers and Team Play card counting, the so called “Big Player” system can indeed be vulnerable to card counting. Certainly it is a threat in a way that individuals counting cards is generally not. Is there a way that individuals counting cards can be a threat to Casino profitability? Yes there can, one only has to look at the effects that Mr. Don Johnson had in the Golden Nugget, Atlantic City. But part (perhaps the majority) of Mr. Johnson’s genius lay in the concessions that negotiated with Nugget Management/Marketing. Without that base he would have found it much more difficult to win so much money as an individual, even one who bet “so large”. But these are the exceptions. In an exceptional game. Typically mathematicians can’t have an effect on Craps, or on Baccarat (side bets to one side), or Slot machines, or most EGM’s. Roulette can be vulnerable if the wheel itself has a mechanical bias. This can be uncovered by recording numbers and employing very basic statistics. It can also be vulnerable to “wheel clocking”, typically with a device, which takes some math skills to program but really only good reactions to deploy. Also it appears that some people really can, intuitively, “wheel clock” themselves with uncanny degrees of accuracy. But frankly they can all be defeated by calling NMB earlier. So Vegas cannot be “completely destroyed by mathematicians” because it is far less vulnerable to them than might be popularly thought."},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"I have lowered the rent to tenants who agree to a longer term lease than 12 months.

But not a 10 year old boy who didn’t partake in any rebellion. Theon’s purpose was to serve as a puppet. He grows up under Ned’s supervision, learns the ways of the north and understands the values he needs to abide by. He also befriends Robb, the future Lord of Winterfell. Once grown up, Theon would take over the Iron Islands. Perhaps, he only returns after Balon’s death. I doubt many would have opposed him at the Iron Islands if the realm was at peace, with Ned and Robert still alive. Theon would then run the Iron Islands and keep them in check under the supervision and informal command of Robb Stark. Theon at the Wall would serve no purpose. Perhaps in time, a northern girl (a Mormont or Karstark) could also be betrothed to Theon to strengthen the alliance between the north and the Iron Islands."},{"instruction":"f suppose I want to live in the forest just like Sri Rama lived in the forest for 14 years, then which forest to choose in India?","output":"Iam not aware of any forests, in which one can live like Sri Rama.

This was probably done because Vulcans who undergo Pon’Farr and do not mate will die. However, as many have pointed out, T’Pring came to understand that she did not want to marry Spock.

What is the closest?","output":"If we are talking about the Sengoku period then gentleman or man at arms is a better comparison than Knight just because most samurai were really low nobility and relative nobodies and nameless in our history books. It’s one of the reasons why samurai went to great lengths to get noticed by their lords and get heads. Samurai made up 10% of the population which is a lot of nobles, even more than Early Modern Poland proportionately. Then again, when most people think of a Knight they really are thinking about men at arms rather than the actual noble rank of Knight so the image of an elite guy in plate armour roughly compared to a samurai in heavy armour is not wrong. I think in light of the military revolutions that went on both in Europe and Japan you can also compare samurai to elite companies of musketeers who would have been made up of lower nobility in Europe. Samurai could be anything from musketeers, heavy pikemen/spearmen, archers, heavy cavalry, as well as spies and and specialized guerilla fighters (Ninjas) so the noble rank of knight does not really compare. We have to be a bit careful with these comparisons because Japan had a similar yet significantly different social structure all the same. In the Sengoku period an ashigaru who wanted to make a name for himself had more opportunities to advance than a regular soldier would have in Europe. Ashigaru were also in a weird spot because they gradually became true professional soldiers and were seen as part of the warrior class yet also the farmer class because they were still commoners. So the line between ashigaru and samurai is more blurred than say the line between a professional longbowmen and a knight. It’s more like longbowman compared to man at arms since that the next step up. Becuase Japan had a shit ton of people and the most powerful daimyo commanded armies not only from their own clan but multiple clans you could get armies tens of thousands of men strong. Samurai were a minority compared to ashigaru but they still made up a considerable part of any given army. Knights as in actual knights and not men at arms on the other hand are a much smaller minority. I think in earlier periods where samurai were heavy horse archers supported by lightly armed retainers and servants you can make the argument that they are a bit more comparable to actual knights since each samurai had a small personal retinue. This is less so the case in the Sengoku period unless you are a bit higher on the pecking order though obviously servants were still important."},{"instruction":"What are the responsibilities of a business analyst?","output":"if you are a Business analyst in any organization then you have many responsibilities for the growth of the organization.

It is clear that Ukraine and NATO are winning the propaganda war hands down. The decision by NATO powers to be very transparent about the military intelligence, especially publicising Russia’s invasion plans and “false flag” propaganda operations prior to the actual invasion, has proved to be very successful and has been widely praised as a master stroke. Transparency has pros and cons, one disadvantage being that Russia is better informed than it would otherwise be and another being the potential compromising of intelligence sources, but clearly the NATO political and military leadership consider that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Personally, I think that they are right in this assessment. So, no, IMO it is not stupidity at all."},{"instruction":"What did people think about the reasons for the extinction of the dinosaurs until they found the meteorite?","output":"They found the K-T layer in the strata before they found the cause of that layer. In other words, the more informed were not surprised to hear about the theory. The theory predated the discovery. And what is an even better answer to your question is that by the time that the fossil Archaeoptyrix was discovered, people were beginning to understand that the dinosaurs were not really “lizards”. That would mean both no dinosaurs alive today and dinosaur descendants today. Then some people had the brilliant idea that if birds evolved from dinosaurs, maybe birds are dinosaurs. All it would take would be to define “dinosaur” in some way that excluded lizards but did not exclude birds. Now, we even have a better understanding of the entire sequence of events. It took a while for the climate change created by the meteor impact to kill off all the non-bird dinosaurs. By the way, we found the impact crater before we found what was left of the meteorite in it.

Right now I am about 890 pounds and my BMI is 180, because I'm only 4 feet 11 inches tall. I'm definitely morbidly obese, so I hope that I can answer your question. I am so fat that I can't even walk. So, there are two sides to being obese, at least for me. There's the part of me that loves being this fat, and the other that hates it. I will explain the part that loves it first, because it probably makes no sense to most people. There are good things about being obese, especially as obese as I am. One thing is that I don't have to do anything for myself. Since I am unable to get out of my bed, because im so fat, my parents do everything for me. They bring me food, wash me, and let me live in their house. I don't need a job or anything. Another good thing about being this fat is that I can be as carefree as I want. All I have to do is eat. I don't have any other responsibilities. I don't fit into any clothes either, so I don't have to worry about an outfit. I also love being this fat because of the fat itself. Its nice to have a gigantic butt, stomach, and gigantic legs and boobs. Unfortunately, being this fat has some bad things. I could die at a young age, since I am only 18. I can't walk, and have not been able to for the past 7 years. In conclusion, I think that there are more pros than cons to being morbidly obese to the point where you can't walk. I love it, and maybe you will want to try being this fat. I hope that answers your question."},{"instruction":"Which is a better band: Iron Maiden or Judas Priest?","output":"Easy to say Priest rocks!!!

One of the main reasons is that Koufax not only had the best fastball in MLB when he played. As if that wasn’t enough, he developed a curve ball that was considered by many or most players at the time to also be the best in MLB. Look at Sandy’s strike out of Mickey Mantle in the final game of the 1963 WS. The two pitches- the fastball and curve ball- reinforced each other. If a batter tried to guess and expect a blazing fastball, Koufax would curve him such that the ball seemed to drop about 4 feet and to the side. If a batter thought Sandy might throw him a curve (since he got him out the previous time with a curve ball), Koufax would blow the batter away with his (unmatched in speed and movement) fast ball. Fortunately for opponents, Koufax did not throw at hitters. He didn’t need to overpower them. Koufax’s maximum strikeouts in a season was 382 in 1965, when he went 26–8. I had the good fortune to see Koufax pitch a no hitter in 1964 against the Phillies in Connie Mack Stadium. Other great starting fastball pitchers were Walter Johnson, Lefty Grove, Bob Feller, Bob Gibson, Nolan Ryan, Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson, and Max Scherzer."},{"instruction":"Which GUI are you using in Ubuntu?

The food cooks rapidly and uniformly under this heat. Some individuals worry that microwaves might lead to cancer or other illnesses. However, these statements are not backed by any scientific data. The World Health Organization (WHO) has actually said that there is no proof that microwaves are harmful to human health.

We have a meeting with the teachers in question and here's what was going on: my older son was very careful with the quality of his handwriting because his autim required it, but the teacher was requiring the students to copy their assignments from the chalkboard, but she would erase it before he could finish. She wouldn't let him explain, and could not understand what it did to him. She said that he, a child who was going to therapy to learn to improve his fine motor skills, should just ‘keep up’. We suggested she might just hand out the assignments on paper, but she refused, and the principal backed her up. Their solution was to set up an empty room for him to ‘cool down’. My younger son, who also had trouble with his fine motor skills, and could only write big sloppy letters because he wasn't as far along in his therapy, was held alone in a room with his teacher on special student reward days (various outdoor fun events, pizza, etc) to redo ALL his work that she had saved up to punish him into being more careful in his handwriting. We tried to explain that he was going to therapy to work on this, and it wasn't his fault and all they were doing is hurting him emotionally and socially, but again, the principal took her side.

Now, by putting any set of values we may prove the required statement… Like, if x= 1/2, y= 7, z=3 Then, LHS = x(1-y²)(1-z²) + y(1-z²)(1-x²) +z(1-x²)(1-y²) = 1/2(1–49)(1–9) + 7(1–9)(1– 1/4) +3(1–1/4)(1–49) = (1/2 * -48 * -8) + (7*-8* 3/4) + (3* 3/4 *-48) = 192 -42 - 108 = 192 - 150 = 42 = 4 * 1/2 * 7* 3 = 4xyz = RHS [ Hence Proved ]"},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"There are more cells in the human body than stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The human body contains about 37 trillion cells, while the Milky Way galaxy contains about 100-400 billion stars. So, there are about 370-1,000 times more cells in the human body than stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Each cell is a living organism in its own right, with a skin, organelles and other systems that work together allowing the cell to reproduce. Each cell contains about 3 billion base pairs of DNA. This is equivalent to about 2 meters of DNA if it were stretched out. (Coincidentally, that means that if the double helix of all the DNA in an average human body was “unzipped” and pulled out to its maximum length, it would reach from the sun to Pluto’s mean orbital distance.) The fact that there are more cells in the human body than stars in the Milky Way galaxy is a testament to the incredible complexity and wonder of the human body. Amendment Seems I may well be wrong about the total length of the unzipped DNA strands - I had a distant memory that most of those multi-trillion cells are red blood cells, and I had a suspicion that these do not contain DNA - checked it with Bard, so I’m reasonably confident a widespread fact like this it will get correct Mature red blood cells (RBCs) do not contain DNA. They are anucleate, meaning they do not have a nucleus. The nucleus is where DNA is stored. Without a nucleus, RBCs cannot synthesize new proteins or divide. They can only carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, immature RBCs, called reticulocytes, do contain DNA. Reticulocytes are still developing and have not yet lost their nucleus. They make up about 1% of the total number of RBCs in the body."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"There were several good cars available in India under 10 lakhs.

Here are some general strategies and options to consider: 1. Diversify your investments: Diversification helps spread risk by investing in a variety of assets. Allocate your investments across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Within each asset class, diversify further by investing in different industries or geographic regions. 2. Invest in stocks: Stocks represent ownership in a company and can provide long-term growth potential. You can invest in individual stocks of specific companies or opt for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds that offer diversification across a broader range of stocks. 3. Bonds and fixed-income investments: Bonds are fixed-income securities issued by governments or corporations. They provide regular interest payments and return the principal at maturity. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks and can provide a steady income stream. Consider Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, or bond funds. 4. Real estate investment: Real estate can be a tangible and income-generating investment. You can invest directly in properties (residential or commercial) or invest indirectly through real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pool funds from multiple investors to invest in real estate properties. 5. Mutual funds and index funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Index funds, a type of mutual fund, aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index. They offer broad market exposure and can be a more passive and cost-effective investment option. 6. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They provide exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets and can be a flexible and cost-efficient way to invest in various markets or sectors. 7. Invest in yourself: Consider investing in your education, skills, and personal development. This can lead to career advancement and higher earning potential in the long run. 8. Consult a financial advisor: If you are uncertain or lack the expertise to make investment decisions, consider seeking guidance from a certified financial advisor. They can help assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals to develop a personalized investment strategy. Remember, investing involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. It's important to research and understand the investment options, assess your own financial situation, and diversify your investments based on your goals and risk tolerance."},{"instruction":"What's a good digital marketing agency in the UAE?","output":"In the digitally-savvy world we live in, having a vital internet presence has become inevitable for businesses.

I’ve worked in restaurants, hotels, and casinos. People can be quite entitled for a number of reasons. In restaurants, people get incredibly upset if their food isn’t prepared a certain way. They’re hungry and grumpy. They take it out on the waiter. When people get to a hotel, they’re tired because they have been traveling. Their kids are tired and hungry. Sometimes, guests end up at a hotel because their flight has been delayed. They want to go home. They’re disoriented. That really freaks people out. And they know they’re not going to come back, so they’re on their worst behavior. Sometimes, people feel powerless in their daily lives and they want to feel like they have some sort of control, so they mistreat people who work in the service industry. Other think that they can get something free if they yell loud enough. My boss at a hotel I worked at told us to let people vent. I was a terrible employee because I refused to let people vent, which is just a psychobabble way of telling people it’s ok to act like a selfish child and abuse people who have no choice but to listen. I once told a man to take a deep breath. He freaked out. Casinos are the worst. People are tired, disoriented, confused, drunk, and hungry. They came to the casino dreaming of winning millions, and they’ve spent the rent money, their kids’ inheritance, or diaper money. They start to pretend to be high rollers and demand perks. They think they deserve a free room, free dinner, free drinks, and access to cocktail waitresses or maids. The only work I think that could be worse is flight attendant. One of our friends works for an airline and she says the passengers are horrible. She does the job because she loves to travel, but it has really changed how she thinks about people from certain countries. It’s sad. But I have to be grateful for the service jobs I had. They allowed me to have a flexible schedule when I was in college, and they motivated the hell out of me to finish and go on to law school. I still have demanding clients, and my profession is the target of many jokes, but for the most part people treat me with respect. I can pick and choose clients. And it pays better, which makes up for a lot. NOTE: In my experience, the real high rollers or important people do not demand special treatment. You can tell by the way they act, and by the way that they treat people, that they are important.

According to the gain medium: The gain medium of the laser includes gas, liquid and solid, and the specific gain medium determines the laser wavelength, output power and application field. Gas lasers are representative of CO2 gas lasers, and solids are representative of ruby ​​lasers, semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, and YAG lasers; liquid lasers use certain liquids (usually organic solvents, such as dyes) as lasers. The work is pragmatic and emits a laser. According to the output power: usually, it can be divided into low power (below 1000W), medium power (1000-3000W), high power (above 3000W); but the power segments defined by different manufacturers are also different, and there is no uniformity in the industry. specification. Different power lasers are suitable for different application scenarios. According to the working mode: it can be divided into continuous laser and pulsed laser. The CW laser can output continuously for a long period of time, with stable operation and high thermal effect. Pulsed lasers output in the form of pulses, the main features are high peak power and small thermal effect; according to the length of the pulse, pulsed lasers can be further divided into milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds and femtoseconds. Generally speaking, the shorter the pulse time, , the higher the single pulse energy, the narrower the pulse width and the higher the machining accuracy. According to the output wavelength: it can be divided into infrared laser, visible light laser, ultraviolet laser, etc. Substances with different structures can absorb light in different wavelength ranges. For example, metals have a higher absorption rate for near-infrared light, and non-metals have better absorption for the wavelength (10.6um) emitted by CO2 lasers."},{"instruction":"Where can I find packers and movers in Noida?","output":"A while ago my sister had to move from Noida’s sector 50 to sector 137. She was looking for packers and movers and needed my help. So, I searched on Google and found Porter packers and movers’ website. I used their Instant Quote Calculator to find the prices and showed them to my sister. The prices were quite affordable, so she decided to hire them. She booked an early morning slot. On the day of the move, I was at her home to help her, and Porter’s team arrived on time. The team properly packed and carefully loaded all the furniture, appliances, and boxes into the moving truck. Thanks to the early morning slot, they were able to avoid heavy traffic and smoothly navigate through the city's streets. Once they arrived at sector 137, the movers quickly unloaded the belongings and carefully placed them in the assigned rooms as instructed by my sister. They even helped in unpacking and assembling furniture, making the settling-in process much easier.

Key reasons, in no particular order: Coalition support. When you have a solid bit of the world supporting you, good odds you're going to win. Aerial superiority and air campaign. Before tanks ever engaged in battle, the Coalition owned the skies and had destroyed a great deal of Iraqi military assets.Diplomatic blitz. Iraq was isolated diplomatically during the war.Misdirection. The largest amphibious demonstration in history was performed by the US Marine Corps off the coast of Kuwait prior to the launch of ground operations. This drew Iraqi forces away from the main attack corridor.Quality of equipment. The US and allies had deployed the best gear they had. The Iraqis had second rate Soviet equipment. Not exactly a fair fight.Angle of Envelopement. Most of the Iraqi forces needed to blunt an attack were in Kuwait anticipating that to be the focus area for the coming attack.

Now, the biggest problem with the operation was ‘catastrophic success’. No high level commander was expecting a 96 hour ground war. Coalition forces were so successful that the debate on whether or not to push to Bahgdad was seriously debated. This was decided against as they felt it would lead to long term instability in Iraq and a occupation war we couldn't win.

The second part is a mistake. Krishna wasn’t the most skilled in war strategy. It is Ashwatthama, Karna Dev Ji, Barbarik and Bhisma who are the most superior ones.1: AshwatthamaAshwatthama is the most powerful warrior of Mahabharat. Drona has performed severe penace to please Lord Shiva, later Lord Shiva granted the boon and Drona wanted to have a son with same valour, skill and strength as Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva granted his wish. So, Ashwatthama is the most powerful in warrior in Kurukshetra. This is an old saying, but it is absolutely correct. 2: Karna Dev JiRead [LINKED_TEXT: Rudra · 1yWho was the greater warrior, Karna or Arjuna, according to original phrases from the Mahabharata?When Karna is the supreme commander of the army he fights with all the Pandava warriors i.e. Shikandi, Satyaki, Dristadyumna, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula, Sahadeva and defeats them. Abhimanyu insulted Karna by saying he is no match for him or his father. Abhimanyu then invites Karna to a war. Karna accepts the invitation and breaks his bow (which was gifted to Abhimanyu by Balarama )for insulting him but spares his life because he is son to Karna. Karna was always insulted by Pandavas before they invited him to a war, Karna in proof of defeating them makes their heads shaved. While he handles all the Pandava army Vrushasena battles Arjuna and defeats him but spares remembering his father’s vow to kill Arjuna. In proof of deafeating Arjuna, Vrushasena makes Arjuna’s head shaved. When Karna came to know about the news he arrived and was proud of his son. He says that he is not proud for defeating Arjuna, because defeating Arjuna is quite an easy task and can be accoplished easily, he said that he is proud that his son won his first war. Karna defeated Arjuna and spared his life because it is against dharma to fight or kill anyone after sunset. But, in proof of his victory Karna makes Arjuna’s moustache shaved because a man’s valour, masculinity symbolises in his moustache. That’s the reason Karna does that. Karna also says that he only cut off the thread of his Gandiv bow because he respects the son of Brahma i.e. Agni and breaking the bow gifted by Agni is nothing but insulting him. Karna says that he can only be defeated by three people and they are Surya bhagavan, Parashuram and Shiva. When questioned by Arjuna to Krishna, Krishna replies that Radheya is beyond his father and beyond his teacher in skills and knowledge but he thinks that he cannot defeat them because he loves them and respects them a lot. Bhisma raised his weapon against his teacher, but Karna would never do that. Instead Karna would chose death over raising his weapon against his father, teacher or his lord Shiva. The truth is Karna can only be defeated by Shiva. Karna is beyond his brother Yama and father Surya bhagavan in Dharma, and explains him about the slaying of Yama by Shiva when Yama sprung his noose around the young sage's (Markandeya) neck. By accident or fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, Shiva emerges and slays Yama for his sin. Even Yama has comitted a sin in his life, Karna never did that, it is true that Karna fought by Duryodhana but he never comitted a sin in his life. Krishna says that such a great warrior like Karna can only be killed by deceit, curses and explains about his curses and says he’ll signal Arjuna when Karna’s Chariot will sink. So, explicitly Karna is greater warrior than Arjuna. Attribution: Pictures: copyright lies with the concerned person and source.

Listen to me, Dhananjaya! This that I will tell thee will immediately dispel thy sorrow and infuse delight into thy heart. O thou of great splendour, know, O Dhananjaya, that Karna, his dart being baffled through Ghatotkacha, is already slain in battle. The man does not exist in this world that could not stay before Karna armed with that dart and looking like Kartikeya in battle. By good luck, his (natural) armour had been taken away. By good luck, his earrings also had been taken away. By good luck, his infallible dart also is now baffled, through Ghatotkacha. Clad in (natural) coat of mail and decked with his (natural) ear-rings, Karna, who had his senses under control, could singly vanquish the three worlds with the very gods. Neither Vasava, nor Varuna the lord of the waters, nor Yama, could venture to approach him. Indeed, if that bull among men had his armour and ear-rings, neither thyself, bending the Gandiva, nor myself, uplifting my discus, called Sudarsana, could vanquish him in battle. For thy good, Karna was divested of his ear-rings by Sakra with the help of an illusion. Similarly was that subjugator of hostile towns deprived of his (natural) armour. Indeed, because Karna, cutting off his (natural) armour and his brilliant car-rings, gave them unto Sakra, it is for that he came to be called Vaikartana. Karna now seems to me to be like an angry snake of virulent poison stupefied by power of incantation, or like a fire of mild flames. From that time, O mighty-armed one, when the high-souled Sakra gave that dart unto Karna in exchange for the latter's ear-rings, and celestial armour, that dart, viz., which has slain Ghatotkacha, from that time, Vrisha, having obtained it, had always regarded thee as slain in battle! But though deprived of that dart, O sinless one, I swear to thee that hero is still incapable of being slain by anybody else save thee. Devoted to Brahmanas, truthful in speech, engaged in penances, observant of vows, kind even unto foes, for these reasons Karna is called Vrisha. Heroic in battle, possessed of mighty arms and with bow always uplifted, like the lion in the forest depriving leaders of elephantine herds of their pride, Karna always deprives the greatest car-warriors of their pride on the field of battle, and resembles the mid-day sun at whom none can gaze. Contending with all the illustrious and foremost of warriors of thy army, O tiger among men, Karna, while shooting his arrowy showers, looked like the autumnal sun with his thousand rays. Indeed, incessantly shooting showers of shafts like the clouds pouring torrents of rain at the end of summer, Karna is like a pouring cloud charged with celestial weapons. He is incapable of being vanquished in battle by the gods, he would mangle them in such a way that their flesh and blood would fall copiously on the field. Deprived, however, of his armour as also of his car-rings, O son of Pandu, and divested also of the dart given him by Vasava, Karna is now like a man (and no longer like a god). There win occur one opportunity for his slaughter. When his car-wheels will sink in the earth, availing thyself of that opportunity, thou shouldst slay him in that distressful situation. I will make thee a sign beforehand. Warned by it, thou shouldst act. The vanquisher of Vala himself, that foremost of heroes, wielding his thunder, is incapable of slaying the invincible Karna while the latter stands weapon in hand. Indeed, O Arjuna, for thy good, with the aid of diverse contrivances I have slain, one after another, Jarasandha and the illustrious ruler of the Chedis and the mighty-armed Nishada of the name of Ekalavya There are still many instances. But, I mentioned only one. Source: Sacred Texts.

He has received boons from Lord Shiva. 3: BhismaRead [LINKED_TEXT: Rudra · 1yKrishna had promised not to pick up weapons during the war. Yet he was forced to do so by Bhishma, a human who never ever broke his vows. Is Bhishma greater than Krishna in the matter of personal integrity?Krishna reneged his promise. Yes, Bhisma is greater than Krishna in terms of personal integrity. When Shukracharya asked Bali not to donate anything to the dwarf, Bali refused and said “Bhudevi said that “I’ll hold the one who has committed any sin but not the one who has renaged his promise”.” Bali donated the land to Vishnu who is in the incarnation of a dwarf. Bali is an Asura, but he has very good qualities and was a very good and charitable king. Inspite being an Asura, he never reneged his promise. But, Krishna did. However, raising weapon against the one who is battling another one is not fair according to the rules of “Dharma-yuddha”. When Bhisma defeated Arjuna and was about to slay Arjuna, Krishna was enraged and was about to attack Bhisma. So, the rules violated are: 1- Anyone should not interfere in the battle between two, Bhisma defeated Arjuna and was about to slay him. The battle ends when either one is killed, after sunset, or after one surrendered. So, clearly Krishna violated the rule. 2-The ones who are on the chariot should not attck the others who are foot soldiers or others and the ones who are without a chariot should not attack the ones who are on chariot. So, Krishna violated the rule by attacking the Bhisma who is on chariot. 3-A charioteer must serve the job as charioteer itself, no charioteer should battle. Charioteers can be killed and that’s fair according to the rules of Dharma-yuddha . Krishna is afterall a charioteer. Its foolish that he thinks he can defeat Bhisma who is the son of Ganga and an undefeated warrior. Only Karna, Ashwatthama and Shiva can defeat Bhisma in a fair fight. Bhisma is a very great person and he never broke his promises. He’s not like Krishna who reneges his promises. Now, some might argue that Shiva married Parvati inspite he promised he’ll not marry again. I’ll write down why Shiva married Parvati. After Sati immolated herself, Shiva was extremely sad and in case if he marries again, the woman might have the same situation as Sati, so Shiva pledged not to marry again. Tārakāsura had a clever boon from Brahma that he can only be defeated by Shiva’s son. In case you don’t know, what happened next, you can check in Wikipedia about what happened. Shiva married Parvati only to save the world but not out of anger or his brother in law was defeated by someone. Bhisma is 100% better than Krishna in terms of personal integrity and valiance as well. Attribution: Pictures: copyright lies with the concerned person and source.

From experience, I can say a teacher:student ratio of 1:6 should always produce better academic outcomes compared to a ratio of 1:30+, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the quality of teaching is better. It simply suggests what my experience tells me that with lower ratios is they fewer students can get by without doing work and participating during lessons. Plus, the fact that in public schools we teachers must too often deal with other issues not commonly found in expensive private schools. In public schools, we must accept everyone, and some kids come to us with far lower academic abilities than others, or they come with a greater sense of apathy, or have other issues that private school teachers are less likely to have to deal with. My understanding is that some of the expensive private academies do produce better educated kids, but those kids likely have other motivating factors pushing them as well.

It acts as a point of connection between the end-user and the internet. It is assigned a unique IP address. It isolates the client computer and the webserver from the rest of the network. In other words, the proxy server enables us to connect to any website using a different IP address. It acts as a link between users and the websites or servers to which they are directed. It gathers and distributes data pertaining to user requests. The most critical aspect of a proxy server Is that it does not encrypt data sent over the network. What is the purpose of a proxy server? All proxy servers operate in conjunction with your computer's IP address. An IP (Internet Protocol) address serves as your computer's or device's home address. Similar to how mail is delivered to your physical address, internet requests are routed to your unique IP address, ensuring that data is carried to the correct area. When you browse the web without using a proxy, your IP address is visible to web servers. Indeed, determining your IP address is relatively simple, which can result in security breaches and other identity-related difficulties. An internet proxy also has an IP address, which can be utilized on your behalf to avoid disclosing your true IP address. When you utilize a proxy server, your internet requests are routed through the proxy server, which then forwards them to the appropriate destination on the internet. The web or other server from which you are requesting data subsequently forwards your requests to the proxy address, which response with the requested data. With a proxy server, the proxy server is the only point of contact for your network."},{"instruction":"What is the main reason for England winning the third T20?","output":"England are, quite simply, an extremely good T20 side under the leadership Morgan.

He just stopped talking to his old friends and focused completely on understanding concepts and clearing his backlogs. Eventually, his marks started improving and he got a very decent rank in JEE as well. The point I am trying to make is that having a good company is very important if you are preparing for a competitive exam. It’ll give you healthy competition, emotional support at times, help in clearing doubts etc. In all probability, you’ll anyways lose your coaching friends.

The officer decided to have a little fun with me rather than just flashing his lights. My guess is that he was on one of the overpasses when he clocked me.

Free fall speed. Collapsing into its own footprint. I mean logically, if the fires melted the beams at that frickin spot, the top part would’ve maybe collapsed down 20 or 30 floors. Maybe 40. Then would likely topple over. What it WOULDN’T DO, is collapse the entire building, in on itself. Literally on its own footprint, just give me a break. NOBODY with any sense believes that. Look, build a Jenga tower lol And RIP the supporting blocks off the top part of the tower, and watch what happens. That’s what would’ve happen, probably, to the WTC towers. It’s damn near IMPOSSIBLE for the buildings to have collapsed COMPLETELY, and neatly into its own footprint. Both of them. Like wtf, who actually believes that. Btw, WTC Building 7 collapsed in the exact same manner. And NO PLANE HIT IT. A 600 foot tall building. Just, somehow it caught fire, and came down within a few hours, and you look at the collapse, it’s very obviously a demolition job. And there’s proof, the at the time owner of the WTC Complex, Larry Silverstein, went on PBS and said this: \\"I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire … and I said, 'Well, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life … maybe the smartest thing to do is, is 'pull' it … and they made that decision to 'pull' … uh, and we watched the building collapse.\\" I mean HELLO. In your frickin face, right there lol WTC7 was “pulled”. Industry talk for demolished. I mean he admitted it lol That’s not a conspiracy theory now, is it. Btw, in the weeks prior to 911, Larry Silverstein had taken up huge insurance policies on the entire WTC Complex. He cashed in quite nicely soon after. Coincidence.

How can you spot an authentic one from a replica one, especially online?","output":"Fashion brand Chanel is renowned for its timeless designs and high quality, especially its iconic Chanel Jumbo bags are highly sought after. However, there are also many replicas on the market that try to imitate the real Chanel Jumbo bag. Distinguishing between genuine and fake has become an important issue when purchasing, especially when shopping online. So, when you mention how to identify a \\"real\\" and \\"fake\\" (replica) Chanel Jumbo bag, start with the logo and trademark of the bag first. The real Chanel Jumbo bag uses high-quality materials, such as high-quality leather, metal Fittings and meticulous sewing. Counterfeits often use lower-quality materials, with less texture and detail than the real thing. In terms of workmanship details, a real Chanel Jumbo bag is finely crafted, with even and strong stitching, and smooth and evenly plated metal hardware. Counterfeit products may have problems such as rough stitching, rough metal fittings, or easy peeling of the plating. In terms of logo and logo design: The logo and logo of a genuine Chanel Jumbo bag are usually well designed and crafted, with clear, symmetrical typography and the correct representation of Chanel's brand identity. Counterfeit logos and trademarks may contain misspellings, mismatched fonts, or inaccurate graphic details. Importantly, in terms of price and availability: Genuine Chanel Jumbo bags are usually more expensive and can only be purchased through official channels, boutiques or authorized retailers. If a website or seller is selling a Chanel Jumbo bag at an extremely low price, it is likely a counterfeit and you need to be cautious when buying at this time. At the same time, due to the development of e-commerce, people conveniently enjoy the discounts brought by online shopping and obtain diversified choices. Then, when you buy Chanel Jumbo bag online, you should choose the official website or authorized retailers to buy, and avoid buying from unknown or suspicious websites; if you choose to buy on a third-party platform, be sure to check the seller’s reputation and evaluation; carefully Reviewing product images and descriptions is also a point of reference. Last but not least, don't forget about the Chanel Jumbo bag logo and logo design."},{"instruction":"What led to sudden crash in stock markets during the 2nd week of February 2016?","output":"I think it was the testimony of FED Chief Ms Janet Yellen where she honestly expressed her concern about US economy with its ballooning trade deficit.

Yeah I am all of 18 but look more like 20 and I am dressed well if simple other than a 200 set of Tony Lama boots I just had to have. I guess I should point out that I was an overachiever as a kid. I owned a locksmith company that I stared when I got a driver's licence. Did it the summer before and found I was better at it than the guy that hired me quickly. At this point I have two full time employees and two people that have their own business that will work on commision jobs for me. Waitress comes by drops off a menu comes back takes my food order and puts my drink on the table. She’s gone now till my food is ready and after dropping it off she’s gone again. Refilling my tea glass is not on her to do list. End up asking another Waitress for a refill. Second one asked if I wanted desert and filled my tea glass a few times. By now I am hot under the collar and want to be sure the first one knows it. First one walks by and drops the check on the table with out a word. I am well past just hot now. When I get to the register the manager is standing around so I pointed out the Waitress that did help me and asked him to call her over. I am sure what happened next was unexpected by them all. Brought out a 50 bill and told him that she waited on me when the other one couldn’t be bothered with me and I want it clear this is hers. It’s not going in the shared tips right? When he said OK I handed it over I seen it go in her pocket and left. Driving off I noticed the pair had turned into a threesom. First Waitress looked like she was getting chewed out and the second one was enjoying the moment. Largest tip I have ever gave out and over a 6 meal no less. I will give you just one guess who went up to the door and took me to a table next time I went in. Woman was a bit possessive of me. She looked at the other Waitresses and announced “This is MY table now.” So I only tipped 5 she was still happy.

When your blood sugar is out of balance, it can lead to serious health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. It's essential to take measures to regulate your blood sugar levels and maintain healthy levels. Luckily, nature has given us some excellent tools to do just that. 1. Eat a High-Fiber Diet One of the most effective ways to help regulate your blood sugar levels is to consume a diet rich in high-fiber foods. Fiber slows the absorption of glucose, preventing spikes and crashes in your blood sugar levels. Foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are all great sources of dietary fiber. 2. Exercise Regularly Regular exercise can significantly improve your body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels. Exercise helps to burn glucose stored in your muscles and liver, reducing your overall blood sugar levels. It also makes your body more sensitive to insulin, which is the hormone that helps transport glucose from your blood to your cells. 3. Manage Stress Levels Stress can cause significant fluctuations in your blood sugar levels. When you're stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which increases glucose production in the liver. Chronic stress can lead to consistently high levels of glucose in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of developing diabetes and other health problems. Try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga to help manage your stress levels. 4. Add Cinnamon to Your Diet Cinnamon is a spice that has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. It works by improving insulin sensitivity and increasing glucose uptake in cells. Adding cinnamon to your diet is simple; you can sprinkle it on oatmeal, add it to your morning coffee, or incorporate it into your baking. 5. Incorporate Chromium Into Your Diet Chromium is a mineral that has been shown to help improve insulin sensitivity and regulate blood sugar levels. It's found naturally in foods such as broccoli, green beans, and whole grains. However, many people don't get enough chromium in their diet, so taking a supplement may be necessary. 6. Stay Hydrated Drinking plenty of water is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels. Dehydration can lead to a spike in blood sugar levels, as well as a decrease in insulin sensitivity. Drinking water regularly can help your body maintain healthy glucose levels and reduce your risk of developing diabetes. 7. Eat Foods with a Low Glycemic Index The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly foods raise your blood sugar levels. Eating foods with a low GI can help regulate blood sugar levels, while foods with a high GI can cause a spike in glucose. Foods with a low GI include whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. 8. Try Herbal Remedies Several herbs have been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels, including fenugreek, ginger, and garlic. If you want to learn more click down below!

But as others have stated with excellent answers and calculations, practically, there’s no way to fold it that many times, mainly because after ~58 folds, your folded pieces will get around the size of an atom (in x/y plane, z being constant) and from there-on, good luck “folding” it. And “fold” to reach this case means “perfect cut” (otherwise folding implies losses and tensions with paper bending - see last picture). Here’s a visual Excel quickie to better visualise distances, with kms, light years and parsecs at each fold (ignoring Excel’s lack of precision on huge scales). But, just for fun, ignoring laws of physics, an A4 paper, “folded”: ~43 times - you’ve passed the Moon~52 times - you’ve passed the Sun~58 times - you get around the atom size with your cut pieces~70 times - you’ve reached Alpha Centauri~104 times - the huge line of fragmented elementary particles stretches longer than the diameter of the observable universe. Enjoy! Edit: Updated the above sheet on the good observation of Ben Sheard. Thanks Ben! 2nd edit: Practice shows that you can’t do it more than 6 times unless you’re an origami master. :)"},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"Many have a diluted idea of the abilities of these people, in Miraca Gross’s study on children with Form L-M scores of 160+, it was found that radical acceleration did nothing to change the children's class rank, they still outperformed the class even ceilinged on university entrance exams. There was no big fish, little pond phenomenon except in relativity. However, there ARE further gains to intelligence along the bell-curve, an IQ around 180 can master a graduate course in two days of trivial effort which amounts to an IQ of around 145, a decade or more of graduate courses in a week! The normative sample included at least a few individuals whose Form L-M scores (completed separately from the standardization project) were above 200, but none of them scored beyond 148 on the SB5 Standardization Edition. This does not mean that the individuals tested do not have extremely high abilities; it only suggests that in terms of standard score IQs, their scores are within three or, at most, four standard deviations of the mean. Most human beings are a bit under-able, we rely far too much on societal institutions to attain basic needs like employment of any kind, our education process is so fragile that missing out on a few years can badly dent our life trajectory, and for most of us, the upper-middle class is not guaranteed. When we are coming of age, we panic over the quotidian we took for granted at our parents custody without a decent start, we'd be shooting up in an alley somewhere but we certainly cannot say that of Zhao Bowen as he is portrayed in Wired’s article, we cannot say this of a group that scores in a rare percentile above the average expected IQ of any scientist. It is known by Feist’s 1998 paper that people of these IQs are on average, the merit of eminent scientists who have been and as of present and rather non-wishfully, recognized for their academic originality, deca-billionaires in technology and finance, and we also know they score 1.5 standard deviations below the mean in the patron saint of every an average man, hard work. Hard work does make people think they can do anything, eventually this and eventually that.

The seat is wider and closer to the ground, which makes them the safest type of stationary bike. More Number Of Targeted Muscles Cycling, in general, helps you build muscles in your thighs, legs, and glutes. Recumbent bikes target more number of muscles than other cycling exercises because your leg positions are different. Motivation To Push Harder and Farther The comfort of the recumbent bike helps you feel motivated through your workout. It’s more likely that you’ll hop back on the bike tomorrow if the bike is super comfortable and you love cycling on it. Not so if it causes butt and back pain. If you keep your body pain-free, you’ll be able to push harder. Increased Comfort There’s a good amount of research which shows that recumbent bikes are easier on the knees and back, and this makes them suitable for use by patients suffering from arthritis and similar problems. The larger seat, semi-reclining position, and back rest of the recumbent bike help in providing greater comfort and make sure that you do not encounter any pain in the buttocks after extended usage. These are some of the many benefits of a recumbent bike. Although the differences between all the bikes are very nuanced, the impact created is pretty huge!

The choice of wood significantly influences the quality and strength of the final product. In this comprehensive discussion, I'm excited to share insights into the strongest and highest-quality wood options that lend themselves to crafting remarkable furniture pieces. ♣ Oak Among the most revered choices for furniture making is oak. Its remarkable strength and durability make it a timeless favorite. Oak comes in two primary varieties: red oak and white oak. While red oak offers a warm hue and distinct grain patterns, white oak is known for its water-resistant properties, making it ideal for outdoor furniture as well. ♣ Maple Maple is another top contender renowned for its strength and appealing aesthetics. Its fine texture and consistent grain patterns contribute to its popularity in crafting intricate furniture pieces. Maple's light color lends itself well to staining or finishing, allowing for creative customization. ♣ Walnut Walnut is prized for its rich, dark color and distinctive grain patterns. Beyond its elegant appearance, walnut possesses impressive strength and resistance to decay. It's often used for crafting heirloom-quality furniture that stands the test of time. ♣ Cherry Cherry wood exudes warmth and charm, and its natural aging process results in a deepening of its color over time. Cherry wood is moderately hard, making it suitable for both structural strength and intricate detailing. In the realm of furniture making, oak, maple, walnut, and cherry wood are revered for their exceptional strength and quality. These timeless choices ensure not only durable furniture but also pieces that exude enduring beauty and craftsmanship."},{"instruction":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","output":"My Kindle Paperwhite displayed after going past the “critical battery” message, would not charge up even though yellow led was on, tried different cables/chargers, even left it on charge overnight, still would not startup.

First, I don’t wear bathrobes. Second, I have one that two of my sons gave me when the older was in college and the younger in high school. It will last me till I die, I’m certain. They have stayed at my house enough times that you’d think they might have noticed me NOT walking around in a robe. But, no. I told them, after the third robe in four years that I appreciated it, but that I really never wore robes. Did I mention that they don’t get gift receipts? You are supposed to LOVE this random thing bought with no thought. So, after returning the most recent robe, I felt confident that even if I got something inappropriate, at least it wouldn’t be a darn robe the next Christmas. I open the box, and in it is THE mist hideous robe I’ve ever seen: giant fuzzy lavender robe, in a size L/XL. I wear a small. I gave up. I told them it was much too large. Interestingly enough, the robe I got the next year was the last gift I received from them. After a fiasco on Easter, I decided that I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life dealing with their narcissism and demands, and haven’t seen them, except at a family wedding, since. Peace. Quiet.

Back then, most people were still buying CDs and using physical media to listen to music. But Apple saw the potential in digital music and portable music players. They made the iPod with a simple and easy-to-use design and connected it to their iTunes software, which made it easy to get and organize digital music. But the really clever part was that Apple also talked to big music companies at the same time. They worked out deals to sell digital music through their iTunes Store. By doing this, Apple created a whole system that was great for both people who wanted to buy music and the people who made the music. This move helped Apple become the biggest company in the digital music market. It also changed the music industry a lot and made Apple successful with other things like the iPhone and App Store.

Regardless of your caste, creed, gender, or economic background, Mumbai can provide you with respect and happiness. There are many cities in the world where one goes for work or just to explore and return to their city with a lot of memories which they cherish for a few days or even weeks to come before they forget about it and get back to their daily routine but once someone comes to the city of dreams, even if it’s for a few days, that person can never truly leave the city. It's as if a part of them hasn't and doesn't want to leave the city!! People who actually live in Mumbai never complain about the humidity, pollution, uninvited rains, small apartment sizes, traffic, endless rush, local trains. That’s the job of a person who has just moved to the city and/or has never lived in the city. The list of all the things I adore about the city is, unsurprisingly, rather large, but there are a handful of things that are particularly dear to me. Here are those things in no particular order. LOCAL TRAINS courtesy:- mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com How much I love and miss this sight!! Fun fact:- In 2016, Railway officials hired surveyors to travel in local trains and count passengers, the number was believed to be around 80 lakhs per day!! That is more than five times the population of Estonia, ten times the population of Bhutan, and just a little less than the population of Switzerland. However, this is merely a number for someone who needs to catch the train he’s supposed to, to avoid being late for school, college, or work. Yes, Local trains are crowded, and sometimes you would think that it’s impossible to get in but that’s all from the outside and once you get in, you will find that there’s always room for someone else. Whenever you are running to catch a moving train, there will always be one hand sticking out to pull you in. TRUE STORY!! The kind of things one encounters on a local train is simply quite magical!!

Why do folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand think that they are entitled to free healthcare?","output":"Universal health care is not free. It is paid by the state to protect its people and thus improve the well being of the state. That is not socialism. That is just common sense. There are many things that the state pays for to benefit society. If you don’t believe in socialism then stop using the roads. Stop calling the police. Stop using the library. Stop calling the fire fighters. Stop using the armed forces. Stop sending your kids to public schools. You have not paid for them! What is your definition of the best health care system? Is it having opulent medical buildings? Is it having shiny medical equipment? Or is the measure something more relevant to the health of the people? The best measure of a health care system is how well it enables and preserves the health of its people. On that basis, not only does USA have the most expensive health care but for a very rich country, it does NOT have anywhere close to the best medical outcomes.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"I did a study of the standardized test data in the state of Indiana right before they allowed private and charter schools to choose their own method of testing. (This is key because comparing performance on different tests is meaningless, so it became impossible after that to do an apples-to-apples comparison.) What I found was quite interesting. Here is the data: You can see why the folks making the rules decided to allow the private schools to choose their own tests. (Many of our state politicians receive a lot of election campaign money from for-profit charter school companies and lobbies.) There was one private school that performed markedly better than the public system. It was a very selective school in Indianapolis that required a high tuition (much more than that covered by the standard state voucher). Here is the tuition: So how much dies the state cover? The price of this school keeps out the poor, even after accounting for vouchers. This is a very exclusive school and it is meant to be that way. Only the best are allowed to attend. My high school (James Logan High in Union City, California) always had the best football team in the area. Why? We had almost 4,000 students at our school. The rest of the area high schools had between one or two thousand. So our team? It was like selecting the best players from three regular schools. Of course we always performed better. When you can select your students, you are going to get better results. My study indicated just that. It’s fine if you want that advantage for your child. But as the data indicate, the only meaningful (and objectively-measurable) difference in educational outcomes is one you will have to pay for. If you’re willing to pay, go for it. I probably would have if I could have afforded it for my kids. I would have loved to compare data from before the state started granting vouchers, but private schools had no state testing requirement at that time. My suspicion is that the vouchers reduced performance at the private schools that accepted them. Having overheard two Fort Wayne private school teachers griping about how the “voucher kids” were ruining their schools and changing the school culture, that would be my conclusion."},{"instruction":"Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?","output":"To me they are the most beautiful dogs in the world and I will never get another one.

These methods frequently include dietary adjustments, physical activity, stress reduction, and specialized nutritional supplements. [LINKED_TEXT: <Click here to get instant access.] [URL: https://bit.ly/3HL0shp] Dietary change is a crucial component of the blood sugar breakthrough. Blood sugar levels can surge while eating a diet rich in refined carbs and sugar, which can result in insulin resistance and other health issues. It is advised to eat a diet high in whole, nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbs, and low in processed foods to achieve the best blood sugar control. This kind of diet can support blood sugar level stabilization, enhance insulin sensitivity, and advance general health and well-being. Exercise is a crucial component of the blood sugar breakthrough. Regular exercise can enhance insulin sensitivity and encourage the uptake of glucose by cells, improving blood sugar regulation. Additionally, exercise can help to lower stress, elevate mood, and advance general health and well-being. Along with strength training activities at least twice each week, it is advised to exercise for at least 150 minutes at a moderate intensity or 75 minutes at a strenuous intensity each week.

Maintaining social ties, getting enough sleep, and taking part in hobbies or other fun activities can all help lower stress and advance general health and well-being. The blood sugar breakthrough method may also include targeted dietary supplements. Alpha-lipoic acid, magnesium, chromium, and cinnamon are just a few of the nutrients that have been proven to help with blood sugar regulation and general health and well-being. Before beginning any new supplements, it is crucial to see a healthcare provider because some of them may interact negatively with prescription drugs or have other unintended effects. The Blood Sugar Breakthrough is a complete strategy for enhancing blood sugar control and advancing general health and well-being. This method often entails dietary adjustments, regular exercise, stress reduction techniques, and specialized nutritional supplements. By using the Blood Sugar Breakthrough method, people can lower their chance of developing diabetes and other health issues, control their blood sugar levels better, and promote overall wellness. In a nutshell, blood sugar: Blood sugar, also referred to as \\"blood glucose,\\" is a vital molecule in the human body that fuels cells with energy. It is a form of sugar that is produced by the food we eat and is found in the bloodstream. The body has strict control over blood sugar levels, and when they stray from that range, major health problems can result. Carbohydrates are the body's main source of glucose, which is converted into glucose molecules by digestive system enzymes. The blood then carries these glucose molecules to the cells all over the body, where they are used for energy production. In the form of glycogen, which may be broken down and released into the bloodstream when blood glucose levels are low, the liver and muscles also store glucose.

The pancreas produces insulin in reaction to elevated blood sugar levels, which aids in moving glucose from the bloodstream into cells for use as fuel or storage. Contrarily, the pancreas secretes glucagon in reaction to low blood sugar levels, which aids in stimulating the liver to release glucose from storage into circulation. When fasting or immediately following a meal, normal blood sugar levels fall between 70 and 140 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Numerous tools, such as blood glucose meters, continuous glucose monitors, and laboratory tests, can be used to measure blood sugar levels. For general health and well-being, regular blood sugar levels are essential. Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar levels, can cause diabetes, heart disease, renal disease, and nerve damage, among other health issues. Hypoglycemia, commonly known as \\"low blood sugar,\\" can be harmful and result in symptoms like weakness, confusion, and seizures. Diabetes, a chronic disease in which the body is unable to generate or use insulin adequately, is one of the most frequent causes of high blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes, which results from an autoimmune reaction that kills insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, and type 2 diabetes, which is brought on by a confluence of hereditary and environmental variables that result in insulin resistance, are the two main kinds of diabetes. To maintain normal blood sugar levels, people with type 1 diabetes must be treated with insulin for the rest of their lives. Adults are more likely to have type 2 diabetes, which is typically controlled with dietary and activity improvements, however, some people may also need medication or insulin therapy. Stress, illness, drugs, and hormonal imbalances are additional elements that can have an impact on blood sugar levels. For instance, certain drugs like steroids and diuretics can have an impact on blood sugar levels, as can the stress hormone cortisol, which can also cause blood sugar levels to increase. Blood sugar levels can be impacted by diet and activity, in addition to diabetes and other illnesses. A diet high in protein or fat can help stabilize blood sugar levels, while a diet high in carbohydrates or sugar can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Increased insulin sensitivity and increased glucose uptake by cells are two additional ways that exercise might help control blood sugar levels. In conclusion, blood sugar is an essential component of the human body that gives cells energy. Blood sugar levels must be kept within the usual range for overall health and well-being, and departures from this range can result in major health issues. In addition to food, exercise, and other factors, hormones like insulin and glucagon also play a role in controlling blood sugar levels. Having a clear understanding of how blood sugar works in the body and making efforts to keep levels normal can help to promote overall wellness and good health. —-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Remember that blood sugar management is individualized, and what works for one person may vary for another.

In reality, we use a significant portion of our brain throughout our daily activities. However, let's consider the hypothetical scenario of what might happen if we could utilize 100% of our brain's capacity. Enhanced Cognitive Abilities: If we could fully utilize our brain's entire capacity, it is likely that our cognitive abilities would be significantly enhanced. This could lead to improved memory retention, faster learning, better problem-solving skills, and heightened creativity.Advanced Processing Power: The brain's processing power could potentially increase, allowing us to process information and make decisions at a much faster rate. Complex tasks could become much easier, and we might be able to handle multiple tasks simultaneously with greater efficiency.Improved Sensory Perception: Enhanced brain function might result in more acute sensory perception, allowing us to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel the world in greater detail and clarity.Telepathy or Mind-to-Mind Communication: In science fiction, the concept of accessing 100% of the brain is sometimes associated with telepathic abilities, where individuals can communicate directly with one another using their thoughts.Mental Health Benefits: With improved brain capacity, we might also see potential benefits for mental health. Conditions like depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders might be more manageable or preventable with such enhanced brain function.Ethical and Social Implications: Accessing 100% of the brain's capacity could raise ethical concerns.

The basic premise of IF is to restrict food intake for certain periods of time, alternating between periods of eating and fasting. In this blog post, we will explore why IF is the best way to lose fat. First and foremost, IF is highly effective for fat loss. By restricting food intake for certain periods of time, the body is forced to burn stored fat for energy. This leads to a calorie deficit and ultimately results in fat loss. Additionally, IF has been shown to increase metabolic rate, which can further aid in fat loss. Moreover, IF is a sustainable way to lose fat. Unlike crash diets or extreme exercise programs, IF is a lifestyle change that can be maintained long-term. It does not require strict calorie counting or the elimination of entire food groups, making it easier to stick to than other diets. In addition to promoting fat loss, IF has other health benefits. For example, it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. IF has also been shown to improve cardiovascular health by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Furthermore, IF is a flexible approach to eating. There are several different types of IF, including the 16/8 method (where you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window), the 5:2 method (where you eat normally for 5 days and restrict calories for 2 days), and the alternate-day fasting method (where you fast every other day). This flexibility allows individuals to choose a method that fits their lifestyle and preferences. In conclusion, intermittent fasting is the best way to lose fat due to its effectiveness, sustainability, and health benefits. By restricting food intake for certain periods of time, individuals can create a calorie deficit and promote fat loss while still maintaining a flexible approach to eating. IF is a lifestyle change that can be maintained long-term and has been shown to improve overall health. **Read more:** [LINKED_TEXT: The best way to get your dream physiqueIntermittent fasting is the best way to lose fathttps://vocal.media/longevity/the-best-way-to-get-your-dream-physique] [URL: https://vocal.media/longevity/the-best-way-to-get-your-dream-physique]"},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"As you said you have his number. some extent Facebook account is created with mobile number then you can check from there also.

First, mark the circles where A and B touch. Then imagine that you drag B along A’s edge without changing the point of B that touches A. After sliding all the way around, B would have made one full rotation relative to itself. Now roll B around A without any sliding. With A stationary, B must roll along A’s circumference 3 times to return to the initial position, for three full rotations. The total rotation of B is 1+3 = four full rotations. QED. Another way to look at this question is to consider rotating B while pinning both A’s center and B’s center in place. Think of gears on fixed axes. To return to the initial position, B will rotate 3 times and A will rotate 1 time in the opposite direction. The ratio is 3, but the relative turns is 4."},{"instruction":"What was trench warfare like in World War I?","output":"As one British soldier named it: The hell named Passchendaele.

It is all compartmentalized meaning information is broken up into parts that are all kept separate from everything else, even stuff pertaining to itself. And it is sort of like a lending library, with unknown byzantine checks and balances for sure, and one such down at the National Archives noticed that things had not been checked back in that had been lent to the Trump West Wing. This was a few months after Trump was forced out of Washington DC, over 14 months ago. That is when the US Government began to politely ask The Donald to return his homework, as it was no longer his job to have this material in his possession. Trump delayed. So the Justice department got involved as the gears of bureaucracy slowly went round. Trump stonewalled. {sounds of well greased gears} Justice insisted. Trump team lawyers turned over 14 boxes- a small tranche of the requested items. This material all had to be checked in by top security officials, obviously a time consuming procedure, see the walled off compartments in the photo above. After some months of grinding away, the National Archives notified Justice that there was still significant missing material. Justice asked Trump & Co and again he waffled, delayed and stonewalled. In June 2022, Justice had a little friendly visit to the south Florida estate and the Trump team produced a little more of the Nation’s Property. And a letter affirming that Trump and Co had turned over everything that the National Archives had requested. After the time needed to process the recovered materials, National Archives notified Justice that Trump had STILL NOT COMPLIED, and that he had gone a step further to have his lawyers produce a lying compliance letter. So an historic pre dawn raid by the FBI at a former US president’s home was authorized by a federal judge, to bring the criminal to justice, starting with the raid to recover the materials from his home that the United States had been politely asking for for fourteen months.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"Yes it is a violation of International law. The whole premise of your side surrendering is that you are not going to be fighting again. If an enemy soldier is still armed, legally they can shoot you. As an example, when MacArthur retreated out of Manila in 1942, he declared it an open city. Under international law, an open city is undefended. The Japanese occupied the city unmolested. However thanks to Arrogance, when General Yamashita did the same in 1944, the Japanese Marines refused to accept the order. So where they defended it became a house to house fight.

Huge, Jet black and with glowing red eyes, he's a fearsome beast to behold. There are many tales of Black Shuck, like at Blythburgh he chased a congregation back inside the church and kept them there by attacking the doors all night. In the morning he'd gone, leaving massive gouges in the doors of the church. In Norfolk he's known to aid travelers who are lost, and guide them to safety. He then goes to the nearest graveyard to rest. Is said that if you see Black Shuck then a member of your family will die suddenly within the week. My favourite story came from one of my friends. He was white when I saw him the next day, looking terrible. The night before, he'd gone to a park with some other friends to drink and have merry, lighting a bonfire for warmth. They at some point decided to try summoning the dog as it was getting foggy and they'd moved to telling ghost stories. They called his name several times and heard a deep growl coming from the fog. Bring drunk they walked towards the sound, only to hear panting and growling from behind them. Getting scared they headed back to the fire, seeing the glow from the fog but it didn't get brighter. Suddenly the glow went out and they stopped, finding the fire beside them which had gone out. I would have scoffed at this but he was so shaken plus the others wouldn't even mention that night. Maybe they heard a fox, maybe he came as a warning not to mess with the occult, then lead them back to camp when they got a bit lost. Maybe they were so drunk they believed the stories were happening. Who knows?

During recess when I was in elementary school, we were playing kickball and an errant ball bounced off his Lincoln as he was speeding down the road. We were terrified. He got out, glared at us, retrieved the ball, gave us a big smile and as we cheered, he gave it a firm kick back over the fence to us. My brother once was talking to him about music and asked him about Elvis. Chuck smiled and said that, of all the people who covered “Promised Land,” only Elvis understood what it really meant (the hazards of being a black male on a cross country trip across the South.) He knew our music, he felt it, and the black folk understood. My brother then asked if he ever visited Elvis at Graceland. Chuck’s expression became dour.

Perfume, also known as \\"parfum,\\" is the most concentrated fragrance and typically contains between 15-30% aromatic compounds. Because of its high concentration, perfume has a strong scent that can last for up to 24 hours or more. It is often used for special occasions and is applied sparingly. Eau de Toilette (EDT) is a lighter fragrance than perfume and typically contains between 5-15% aromatic compounds. As a result, it has a lighter scent and does not last as long as perfume. EDT is often used for daily wear and is considered suitable for daytime use. Cologne, also known as \\"Eau de Cologne,\\" is a type of fragrance that typically contains between 2-5% aromatic compounds. Cologne has a light and fresh scent that is perfect for everyday wear, and it is often used as a body splash or aftershave.

Sometimes you get boxed in and have to write something for various reasons in this sort of situation, so what do you do? It’s awful, but there are approaches to it. First, you do your best to dissuade the person who wants the reference. You can say you have a policy not to write them, but it’s probably better to edge toward being as honest as possible: ‘If I write I can only write about your skill at X and Y and when they read nothing about Z (because we both know I can’t say you were good at that) it will do you more harm than good, so please accept that it will hurt your case even if I write the most glowing report of your other skills and tell me not to write this.’ (You should never put in writing something negative that is not absolutely demonstrated by concrete facts, like ‘you failed exam X.’ If it’s on record somewhere, OK, you have proof, but otherwise you may be sued.) If you cannot talk the person out of it, then write about X and Y without mentioning Z if you must, give the letter (sealed) to him or her and a copy he or she can read for themselves and keep a copy for yourself… and only then email or mail it to the person s/he asks you to send it to, but get the ‘ask’ from him or her in writing so you have proof that s/he did specifically ask you to send it after he or she read the letter. In your letter go heavily on facts, things that are on record somewhere, if only as examples, and stay as far away as you can from opinion. This in itself screams ‘I don’t support this person fully’ to any reader worth their salt. This will all seem very awkward and will take a huge amount of time to do carefully, so, again, anything you can say to this person to get them to drop you off the list of people they want doing references is worth it. You may have to offer help to them on how to explain why you aren’t on the list.

My first job my boss and I went out to a middle school to take field measurements, and stopped by the administrative office to check in. The secretary asked him if he was there to register me for classes. I knew I looked young, but not early teens, for pity’s sake. She apologized once we explained who we were, she said I looked older than most students, but you never knew anymore. If I’m working in an architect’s office people who come in will assume I am the secretary, not an architect. To be fair, this also happened to the only female boss I had. On a construction site, similar assumptions are made, though they may think you are a laborer, unless you are carrying a computer or roll of drawings. If they don’t know you are a peer of their boss, cat-calls are common. Similar assumptions at a lumber yard or other construction supply center, I’m taken for a DIY fixer-upper, until I open my mouth and they realize I know more about what they are selling than they do. I try to take it all in stride, because I know even I have made poor assumptions based on traditional gender roles. The annoying thing is when people get angry with you because they made a mistake and addressed you wrong, like you should be wearing a sign around your neck that says “I’m the boss here”. Its not like anybody was trying to make them look like a fool, and I usually try to pretend it didn’t happen, so we can go make to more normal interactions faster. The one time I did lose it, was a Habitat for Humanity male job site supervisor who assumed that I didn’t know how to use the tools I was carrying and tried to take MY hammer out of my hand so he could show me how, just as I was about to get to work. I barked out “NO!” and held onto the hammer for dear life. Scared him so that he let go immediately, at which point I was able to assure him that I had grown up working on a construction site since grade school, and I could manage quite well without him. People try to fit what they see into their existing understanding of the world, and it makes most really uncomfortable when others don’t fit into the little mental boxes they have the world subdivided into. That is what is really going on with the transphobic bathroom bills, which are not going to catch many transsexuals, who put a great deal of effort into passing as their chosen gender identity. No, it is the androgynous looking people like myself who will be the first victims of these bathroom bills, because we do not fit the gender normative appearance of the gender we were born into, especially since, like me, we have not tried to change the bodies we are born into in any way. There are very few people who actually are born to fit the Barbie or GI Joe body stereotypes, but some people are affronted if they can’t figure out which of those two boxes you fit into. They want to blame non-conformists, even if they are just being who they were born to be, rather than accepting the blame themselves for having a worldview that is so limited in possibilities that it bears no resemblance to reality."},{"instruction":"What’s your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","output":"Not best but here are my 17 advices to the girl :- Learn most in this list in your coming years - Swimming, dancing, photography, driving, bowling, MS-Excel, fishing.Listen to old music occasionally.Read poetry sometimes.Ask your mama's love story as you turn 22Visit temple once a weekTeach someone something as you grow older .

Don't go and confront him about it, as things will only get more awkward since he's your uncle. I remember once when one of my aunts was staring at my navel while I was wearing a net saree. When I noticed it, I simply went and jokingly asked her if she liked my saree. She told me that I looked gorgeous in this saree and asked me from where I got the saree. So that's about it.

Yes, I know it's disappointing for many, but he is far more powerful than ‘the Omnipotent Carol’ also. Heartbreaking, isn't it? Let's get back to the answer. Adam's powers are mysterious. Originally created as a perfect genetic template for the most evolved human, Adam already had Artificial God like power. The most mysterious thing about his power is his apparent deaths. When injured mortally, the mysterious legendary cocoon appears from nowhere and spin around Adam's body. Then inside the cocoon, Adam rests until he gets completely healed. When he comes out, his powers exponentially increases, sometimes gaining new powers. Read his bio for more information. First, let's discuss the powers officially indexed. Much of Adam's powers derived from his unique biology in which grants him vast capabilities and powers. According to Thanos, Adam is also a unique being like himself and is described to be apart of the \\"cosmic norm\\". Avatar of Life: Originally destined to become the Avatar of Life by the In-Betweener, Adam was designated as the Avatar of life by the aforementioned entities in order to oppose the then-Avatar of Death, Thanos, and keep a cosmic balance between life and death. After re-inserting the inactive timeline involving the Magus, Adam was officially recognized as Earth-616's (Marvel's prime universe) Avatar of Life again. Summoning: The first iteration of Magus was capable of once summoning the In-Betweener by saturating his past counterpart in a harmless special radiation that acted as a beacon. Superhuman Physiology: Adam Warlock possesses a number of super-human properties and powers derived from his artificially determined genetic structure. This is owed due to possessing a perfect, genetic template. This perfection was noted by Ultron and the High Evolutionary, who even cited his being was something he could not quite replicate easily. Energy Consumption: His new body, according to Thanos, has made him a more direct consumer of energy much like that of Galactus' heralds and even Thanos himself. This, in turn, allows him to even sustain himself without food or water like the Mad Titan. This can be done via contact with a energy conductor or the energy itself. Prior, he was able to absorb magical energies and life energy as well as other kinds. Superhuman Strength: Warlock possesses super-human strength, though its exact level is unknown. Previously listed at class 4, he could once enhance his strength, enabling him to reach class 40 for less than one hour. However, Adam Warlock has been able to fight hand-to-hand, enhanced his strength mysteriously and injure, beings such as Wonder Man, Thor, and Ulik, who are beyond class 100. ( class 40 = lift 40 tons easily; class 100+ = infinite strength) Superhuman Speed: Warlock is capable of running and moving at speeds much greater than even the finest human athlete. He was able to dodge an attack Galactus made at point-blank range and reappeared above him. It is not known whether he did this by teleportation. He has also been able to move at speeds Drax was unable to see. Superhuman Stamina: Warlock's musculature generates less fatigue toxins, during physical activity, than the musculature of a human being. While not employing his energy to enhance his natural physical strength, Warlock can physically exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to impair him. Superhuman Durability: Warlock's bodily tissues are much harder and more resistant to injury than those of a human. He is capable of withstanding tremendous impact forces, falls from great heights, exposure to temperature and pressure extremes, the vacuum of space, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. His body is also specially adapted to withstand the physiologically debilitating effects of moving and running at high rates of speed without sustaining injury. Superhuman Agility: Warlock's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete. Superhuman Reflexes: Warlock's reaction time is similarly enhanced, enabling him to react at a level that is beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Flight: Adam Warlock can also employ cosmic energy to negate the force of gravity beneath him, enabling him to fly. In an Earth-like atmosphere, Warlock is easily capable of reaching the speed of sound, roughly 770 miles per hour. While in outer space, however, Warlock has been shown to have been capable of attaining supraluminal (faster-than-light) velocities. Immortality: While Adam can be killed, he never truly dies. This is due to the fact his soul is so strong, even Death herself cannot claim his soul. As such, he can be reborn. Cellular Regeneration: Adam's regenerative and restorative abilities are extremely advanced. Ultra Senses: After taking the memories of the Magus from his soul and some of his own abilities as a result, he gained superior senses in which allowed him to locate space anomalies such as black holes Adam was later gifted with enhanced perceptions from his rebirths, allowing him to see the auras, the souls and states of others as well as examine others genetic structure. Cosmic Awareness & Mystic Senses: His multi-compartmental brain bestow Adam cosmic senses. Adam has the ability to detect or produce wormholes and other irregularities in space on a cosmic scale.After one of his recent rebirths, He also has the ability to sense whenever someone is teleporting.Adam possess profound mystical senses in addition to his cosmic awareness capabilities that is capable of sensing mishaps on a spiritual level such as irregularities. Time Freeze Resistance: Adam is capable of resisting the Time Gem's time freeze capabilities when utilized on him by Rune. Reality Warp Resistance: Due to his firm grasp on reality, Adam is highly resistant to \\"reality warping.\\" He was unfazed by Maya's \\"Dance of Unreality.\\" Maya was his first real love whom he had to sacrifice. Gamora was second. Telepathy: While formerly possessing powerful telepathic capabilities as Him, he has since lost most of the high level of telepathic power, retaining a fraction of telepathic power he once possessed. However, the exact level of capability in his Telepathy is unknown. His telepathic defenses have been described by renown and extremely powerful. He was able to throw out Moondragon from his mind as well as dispel Mantis's intrusions. Clairvoyance: Adam is capable of seeing through time, even when an event renders time meaningless. Energy Manipulation: Adam is a capable energy manipulator, with such power having been augmented by the Soul Gem for the majority of his life, although was somewhat capable of doing so independently until his recent resurrections. His latest resurrection has allowed him greater capability with his manipulation, now capable of \\"short-circuiting\\" even other energy manipulators such as both Silver Surfer and Quasar. Matter Manipulation: According to Adam himself after his later resurrection, his increased skill allows him convert energy into matter and has absolute control over the process in addition. Prior to his resurrection, his matter manipulation was great enough to turn Thanos into granite, a process only undone by Death. Energy Constructs: Adam has been seen employing various kinds of energy into constructs. Whether the use of it comes from his metaphysical quantum energy or other kinds of energy, he has been shown capable of creating swords, pieces of armor, and shields. Magic: True to his naming of Warlock and among his energy manipulation capabilities includes manipulating mystical energy for a variety of purposes. He relayed much of his mystical powers, however, from the Soul Gem instead of his own independent energies during his extended time with the Infinity Gem. However, he still displayed some independent powers without it's reliance. Much of his mystic powers includes exorcism, body transmutation, and astral projection. Resurrection: Adam was capable of resurrecting other beings by imbuing their souls into bodies and transmuting to alter it to appear as their original body.Time Travel: Adam can use his mystical powers to travel into the future in his astral form.Soul Anchoring: As a master of his own soul, he can render himself immune to individuals who are capable of draining other's soul.Mystic Portals: Adam has displayed capability in creating mystic portals. Quantum Magic: counter the future dilemma of the Fault expansion into the Cancerverse, Adam's subconscious allowed his resurrected form to gain the power to heal repairing space and reality itself. Dubbed as \\"Quantum Magic\\" and also referred to as \\"Metaphysical Quantum Energy Manipulation\\", this allows him to perform magical feats in which are performed from available energies around him and \\"conjured psi-llables\\". Soul Manipulation: His current powers derived from his newfound \\"Quantum Magic\\", allows him to seemingly continue his usage of his spiritual powers the by manipulating the energy from souls to imbue them to items or to use offensively as beams. Empathy: Because of his connections to the usage of souls overtime, Adam had later gained empathic capabilities from sensing souls. Such capabilities allowed him to feel the billions of souls killed in the Annihilation Wave.Spell Casting: He is also capable of performing large scale and complex spells capable of manipulating the timeline and insert a previously \\"unused\\" future in place of the current timeline. Such a feat, however, can only be performed If properly energized by a tremendous amount of energy and cannot hear others during it's preparation and casting. He can even cast spells for healing,magical energy blasts, telekinesis, magical lightning, teleportation, transmutation, materialization and force field generation. Chronokinesis: Adam can use his Quantum Magic to create an enchantment capable of manipulating timelines in order to overlap an \\"unused\\" future. Such a capability, however, requires Adam to be sufficiently energized. As the Magus, he also controlled the timeline to the point of changing all futures in which he himself rules.Illusions: During his time as Magus, Adam was capable of transmuting even reality itself to create an illusion to fake his death at the hands of a Cosmic Cube.Cosmic power: Among his body's special adaptations are an enclave of cells able to tap and transform cosmic energy for personal use such as projecting blasts of cosmic energy, locate and enter natural space warps, and augment his own physical capabilities. He can use his cosmic powers for healing purposes. Pyrokinesis: Warlock shown the ability to generate intense thermal energy.Astral Outsider: According to Lord Chaos and Master Order, Adam is outside the loop of destinies and as such is capable of deeds in which cannot easily be seen or tracked by even those with cosmic senses (such as Quasar) wielding the Infinity Gauntlet and exclusively using their cosmic senses granted from the gauntlet. This also extends into supernatural powers, with those unable to gather intelligence on Adam Warlock through magical means. Even without the Soul Stone, Adam is still the most powerful ‘Warlock' of Marvel. Now you are gonna ask, without his powers what is he? Let's see his abilities indexed officially. Abilities: Genius-Level Intelligence: Adam possess a profound amount of knowledge from his first-hand experiences dealing with cosmic dilemmas and is considered intelligent in which own right to the point he is considered a genius by Thanos.Mystical Knowledge & Occult Expert: Adam possesses an extraordinary amount of information regarding the mystical and cosmic items among within the universe such as the Soul Gems and the Quantum Bands, the understanding of the universe and it greater powers, and information on the supernatural in which seemed superior to that of Magique and the capability of the Shi'ar Empire.Hacking: Adam was capable of hacking into the Avenger's enemy files records in his leisure time to learn more about the various enemies fought by the Avengers.Master Tactician and Strategist: Adam is an accomplished strategist and tactician. His capability has been noted and even garnered respect from the likes of Thanos, who once remarked him to being a \\"Tactical Genius\\". He was capable of even devising a plan to separate Thanos from the Infinity Gauntlet successfully. Master Manipulator: Perhaps what makes him most formidable is his capability of manipulating others. His level of manipulation has caused him immense dislike from the Silver Surfer because of his renown capability of manipulation. According to both him and Mephisto, this is attribute due to the fact that while he had split himself of his good and evil self, he was a being who didn't considered good or evil relevant to decisions made for the best of the universe.Xeno-Multilingualism: Adam is familiar with alien language, though how much is unknown. He was capable of writing and understanding the names of each of the Kree killed during the Annihilation Wave. He was capable of also learning the language of High Izzau from being around them after being pulled into the Ultraverse. Mastery in Martial Arts: Warlock has gained a great deal of first-hand experience at hand-to-hand combat over the course of his life, and eventually became quite formidable. It's possible some of this is owed due to Adam absorbing the skills of Autolycus, a Black Knight who received combat training from the Universal Church of Truth and Gamora, an assassin trained by Thanos. Some of these skills include capability of using nerve strikes. He has been able to best beings who exceed him in strength such as Triax, Nobilus, and Wonder Man, and he has been successful in holding his own with Olik, even though, physically, he is no match for the likes of Thor, Thanos, or Hercules. Having used the Karmic Staff, Adam was capable of battle other beings with it as a weapon. While the Magus, he also shown capability in using a sword (and later Captain America's Shield) against Martyr, Gamora, and Major Victory.Accomplishments In Philosophy: Warlock also is an accomplished self-taught Philosopher.

Lady Godiva (Old English Godgifu) was an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon noblewoman and the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. She was, by all accounts, a kind and generous soul and made many large donations to the church. But Godiva is best remembered for starring in a rather scandalous 13th-century legend, in which she was said to have ridden naked through the streets of the city of Coventry (somewhat shielded from view by her incredibly long hair, but still buck-ass nude) to convince her husband to give the people a tax cut. From Wikipedia: The legend of the nude ride is first recorded in the 13th century, in the Flores Historiarum and the adaptation of it by Roger of Wendover. Despite its considerable age, it is not regarded as plausible by modern historians, nor is it mentioned in the two centuries intervening between Godiva’s death and its first appearance, while her generous donations to the church receive various mentions. According to the typical version of the story, Lady Godiva took pity on the people of Coventry, who were suffering grievously under her husband's oppressive taxation. Lady Godiva appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to lower the taxes. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride on a horse through the streets of the town. Lady Godiva took him at his word, and after issuing a proclamation that all persons should stay indoors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her long hair. Just one person in the town, a tailor ever afterwards known as Peeping Tom, disobeyed her proclamation in what is the most famous instance of voyeurism. Some historians have discerned elements of pagan fertility rituals in the Godiva story, whereby a young “May Queen” was led to the sacred Cofa’s tree, perhaps to celebrate the renewal of spring. The oldest form of the legend has Godiva passing through Coventry market from one end to the other while the people were assembled, attended only by two knights. This version is given in Flores Historiarum by Roger of Wendover (died 1236), a somewhat gullible collector of anecdotes. In a chronicle written in the 1560s, Richard Grafton claimed the version given in Flores Historiarum originated from a “lost chronicle” written between 1216 and 1235 by the Prior of the monastery of Coventry. A modified version of the story was given by printer Richard Grafton, later elected MP for Coventry. According to his Chronicle of England (1569), “Leofricus” had already exempted the people of Coventry from “any maner of Tolle, Except onely of Horses,” so that Godiva (“Godina” in text) had agreed to the naked ride just to win relief for this horse tax. And as a condition, she required the officials of Coventry to forbid the populace “upon a great pain” from watching her, and to shut themselves in and shutter all windows on the day of her ride. Grafton was an ardent Protestant and sanitized the earlier story. The ballad “Leoffricus” in the Percy Folio (ca. 1650) conforms to Grafton’s version, saying that Lady Godiva performed her ride to remove the customs paid on horses, and that the town's officers ordered the townsfolk to “shutt their dore, & clap their windowes downe,” and remain indoors on the day of her ride. No matter which version of the tale we’re dealing with, it’s still a pretty cool one. I mean, what more could any red-blooded American libertarian male want in a British myth? Some jerkass tyrant’s hot wife takes a dare, strips down to her birthday suit, and rides nekkid through the streets of town, on horseback, her long hair hangin’ down, to get her hubby to quit taxing the people so much. One can’t help but feel sympathy for the tale’s big-hearted and bodacious heroine. Not only is it an enjoyable and rather titillating tale, it’s also a bit more plausible than many other myths and legends—and the very thought that it might’ve happened really spruces up one’s voltage, if you know what I mean."},{"instruction":"Do you think J&K people do not consider themselves as Indian citizens?","output":"I don’t think so.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","output":"Yes there are many Americans that want to decide the Presidency by eliminating the Electoral College and deciding who wins by the popular vote. And why not? The President of the United States of America is the only government position determined by a nationwide vote. Why would it be a bad idea to have “the will of the people” accurately reflected in it? Personally, I prefer the idea of eliminating the “winner take all” provisions of the current state election laws and having the Electoral College votes proportional to the actual votes cast. Let's take a quick look at the Florida stats from 2020: As you can see, the voting was a lot closer than we originally led to believe. Had the Electoral College votes been truly representative, Trump would have recieved 15 Electoral votes and Biden 14. A huge difference from the 29 to Trump and zero to Biden. Now, let's take a look at California before before the Trump supporters start flooding the comments section: Here, we would see Biden getting 35 Electoral votes, and Trump getting 20 Electoral votes. In both cases, significant portions of the state population are effectively silenced by the “winner take all” system currently popular in The US.

String theory is leading nowhere. I have mathematically unified physics two times over. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE.

Indeed, A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course); AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is then CLEARLY proven to be gravity ON BALANCE. E=mc2 is directly and fundamentally derived from F=ma. Indeed, this explains the fourth dimension and the term c4 from Einstein's field equations !!!! (Stellar clustering ALSO proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.) So, on balance, I have CLEARLY explained why THE PLANETS (including WHAT IS THE EARTH AND the Moon) move away very, very, very slightly in relation to what is THE SUN, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE), as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity (ON BALANCE). Great. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE in relation to what is THE EYE. Think about TIME. Great. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE; as this is consistent with E=mc2 AND F=ma !!!!!! Accordingly, ON BALANCE, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution. I have explained why the orange and setting Sun is the same size as the fully illuminated and setting Moon. (They are both the same size as what is THE EYE.) I have mathematically unified physics. I have explained the cosmological redshift, the black hole(s), AND the supergiant stars. I have explained why there is something instead of nothing ON BALANCE !!!!!. Indeed, inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY; as this balances gravity AND inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. This explains E=mc2 AND F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. Think about the man (THE EYE) who actually IS IN outer “space” in careful comparison to/with what is THE MAN (AND THE EYE) who actually IS standing on WHAT IS THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!!!!. Think about TIME. Magnificent. (So, you want to think about TIME AND WHAT IS THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!!!!.) Fantastic !!!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE, as it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!!!!. (Notice that the sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !!!) Great. What we have here is top to bottom perfection. Notice that time is, ON BALANCE, necessarily possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!!! SO, ON BALANCE, TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!!!!!! BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Great. It is ALL CLEARLY proven. I have mathematically unified physics two times over !!!!!. I have proven that, how, and why ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (NECESSARILY AND CLEARLY) gravity ON BALANCE, thereby explaining why there is something instead of nothing (in and WITH TIME ON BALANCE) !!!!! Again, this NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE (in and WITH what is TIME ON BALANCE as well); as gravity is CLEARLY proven to be ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE !!!!. Remember, with regard to TIME as well, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. (It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense.) Don't forget to consider the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. SO, TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. (Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE !!!!) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. I have mathematically unified physics two times over. The ultimate mathematical unification (AND UNDERSTANDING) of physics/physical experience combines, BALANCES, AND INCLUDES opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!!!!!

The 1880s, that is. So that probably qualifies us as long-term residents. My mother grew up in North Beach in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. The neighborhood was safe and clean then. Little crime or homelessness. Things worsened in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. My dad got mugged once doing his job delivering food from his grocery truck. From my own personal experience, the Caltrain Station felt like an abandoned, unsafe no man’s land. The Embarcadero was the same way, when the freeway ran overhead. North Beach had some very sketchy blocks. Piss and broken glass everywhere, in each of these places. Today, violent crime is down and many neighborhoods, such as SOMA, are safer and cleaner. (Yes, property crime is up.) This is the gentrification that we residents are “dealing with”, as the question puts it. When people complain about gentrification today, how it’s bad because it’s “not how the city used to be” it sounds bizarre, because the city has gone through different phases. Some safer, some more dangerous. When anti-gentrification folks say we need to return to the past, why do they seem to imply we should return to piss-and-broken-glass era? Right now, with reduced crime, we are returning towards crime levels of the 30s to 50s era. Why is that something to “deal with” rather than celebrate? Don’t get me wrong, the 30s to 50s weren’t perfect in many ways. We can’t return to it, nor should we try. As a city, we have grown past what we were in those decades. But the point is, the gentrification we are “dealing with” is a return to the crime levels of those decades, and that’s a good thing (unless you’re a criminal)."},{"instruction":"false surrendering a war crime?

So on the contrary, in the light of the Scriptures, a person who claims that abortion is banned in the Bible has obviously not read the Bible.

Soldiers and SEALs are trained to perform a variety of physical tasks that require a combination of strength, endurance, and agility, such as carrying heavy equipment, running long distances, swimming, and climbing. Their training is designed to improve their performance in these tasks, rather than on building muscle mass or developing a certain aesthetic. In addition, soldiers and SEALs also need to be able to perform their duties while carrying heavy gear, which can be a hindrance if they have too much muscle mass. Therefore, they typically focus on developing functional strength and endurance, rather than on building muscle size. It is also important to note that genetics play a role in muscle development, and not everyone is capable of achieving the same level of muscle mass as actors like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel. Ultimately, the physical requirements of elite soldiers and Navy SEALs are unique to their duties, and their training is focused on developing the skills necessary to perform their tasks effectively, rather than on building a specific physique."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Managing Diabetics Body Fit Tips Scroll down to get the best medicine approved by Doctors How to approach diabetes Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body uses blood sugar (glucose) for energy.

Humans have been on this planet how many yrs and have survived without traditional housing. So i think its safe to say we are quite adaptable to our surroundings. I used to joke with my mom that the winter camping trips in girl scouts was more benificial than my college education in survival of adulthood. Its actually alot of hard work. If i knew a big winter blizzard was coming i would gather wood for a few days beforehand. I would be prepared. Its not fun or easy if you wait till last minute. Staying sober is a lifesaver, almost anyone i have seen that froze to death or lost some fingers or toes was drunk or high and didnt realize the toll their bodies were taking. The one nice thing was if you were dumpster diving to make money their was hardly any competition only the die hards went out on a cold winter night, you can at least double and triple the money coming in. Im not going to lie camping out when its below 0 degrees sucks. Being human we will find way to survive. And most people at least try to have enough change for a coffee in a restraunt to stay warm for alil while.

That said there actually are certain projectiles ‘bullet designs” that are - the talon type projectiles are one of many that upon impact form a sharp jagged profile instead of the normal rounded mushroom - these are intended to create massive internal bleeding - however that school of thought has many pros and cons .. depending on location “bullet placement “ which is always the most important variable . A person can be mortality wounded and continue the fight - is it not better to take them out of the fight completely if possible ? . Another factor , what has to be understood is that upon impact the projectile is transformed …..depending on purpose of design - the amount of penetration , and of material intended to be targeted . The second point is that it would be impractical in many situations to have only a sharpened ridge or appendage on the projectiles surface - in a rifle long range the fluting could effect flight / the spin - .projectiles are shaped ultimately to perform at the highest BC , ballistic coefficient possible within the mass allowed . The diameter is a given tolerance per caliber , the length is determined by many factors including necking length ogive /etc of the brass / case and the rest is determined by material of the projectile which determines mass/ weight - and ultimately the shape as per desired BC. The third factor is that the shoulder of the projectile encounters the rifling surface of the barrel , so only the inner diameter of the projectile could be “sharp “ this area is a rather small leading edge , if the sharped area was raised it would have to stay within tolerances less then the outside diameter of the actual “ bullet size “diameter .

Moksha in the sense of Jivanmukti or being liberated while still living in the body is not a thing to be attained by any amount of meditation or by any amount of chanting mantras. Because it is the ever present reality about everyone of us. What's always there cannot be attained but its presence can be obscured due to our intense pre-occupation with the world of names and forms. Many times in life, we see this happening. The object that we are searching for, will be right in front of us and we go on searching for it all over the room or all over the house. Since Moksha as Jivanmukti is not an object to be got through any amount of meditation or japa, should we then give up our spiritual practices? No! That would be the most foolish thing to do. When we have not yet given up our petty mindedness, our lies, our angers, our jealousies, our intense attachment to the world of names and forms, etc…why give up only meditation, japa? There's a beautiful Hindi bhajan… नाम जपन क्यूं छोड़ दिया तू ने? क्रोध न छोड़ा, झूठ न‌ छोड़ा, सत्य वचन क्यूं छोड़ दिया तू ने? Naam japan kyun cchod diya tu ne? Krodh na cchoda, jhoot na cchoda, Satya vachan kyun cchod diya tu ne? Why have you given up the repetition of a divine name? You have not given up anger, you have not given up lies, why did you give up the word of truth? Spiritual practices are absolutely necessary for purification of the mind. A sincere and an earnest repetition of Om Namah Shivaya mantra can certainly purify the mind, provided I don't desire anything else out of its repetition! Japa also can be regarded as a Karma yoga at the mental level. Number is not the main thing here. Faith and devotion, and focus on the divine name is the main thing. If the mind is focussed on the number, I will be more interested in reaching the target of the number of japa I have to do and not on Bhagavan Shivashankar… Yes, in the initial stages of japa, one can count to prevent the mind from running here and there. Japa of Om Namah Shivaya mantra is wonderful. But accompanying the mantra must be a sense of surrender to Bhagavan Shivashankar. I must surrender the japa, fruits of the japa and myself at the feet of Bhagavan Shiva. Even while repeating the name of Bhagavan Shiva, I must feel that the repetition of His name is happening by His grace and not by my effort. It's His grace that makes my effort possible. This feeling needs to be there as long as there is the sense of doership in me. Okay…sense of doership is there but it has no independent existence apart from Bhagavan Shiva. It's Bhagavan Shiva Himself that appears as the sense of doership in me. It's His play, his leela!!! When the mind starts becoming purer and purer, I begin to feel the ever-present Moksha more and more. Finally by Bhagavan Shiva's grace, when the last vestige of “I” drops off…what remains is Moksha or Jivan Mukti and that cannot be described in words. There is another form of Moksha (Mukti) spoken of in our scriptures and that is Krama Mukti or gradual liberation by attaining the world of Bhagavan Shiva (as the question asked pertains to Him). This is also known as the Saguna Brahman or the Absolute Reality with qualities. Saguna Brahman can be attained. Through the japa of Om Namah Shivaya, one attains the world of Bhagavan Shiva, that's Kailasa, lives there in the presence of Shiva, and through His grace realises the formless, quality-less aspect of Bhagavan Shiva, which is the Absolute Reality itself! This is Krama Mukti or realising Jivanmukti after attaining the world of Bhagavan Shivashankar.

With a young population that is rising to leadership and technology driving growth and innovation, there are several business opportunities in multiple sectors that we are going to explore today. 1.Social Impact Investment Funds Social impact is becoming a priority in India as consumers are intelligent, and know what they consume has an effect on them and the earth. This business idea involves fundraising money from various groups of investors to create a fund that will invest socially responsible and positive earth-impacting ventures. 2. Cheap Home Solar Energy Setup Company There is a large opportunity for residents in India to generate their own power and save money. For this idea, you would buy and setup solar equipment for people to install on their roofs or balconies, since apartment living is popular. The solar could feed into the main battery for the individual or building to provide additional power. To execute, you could start by finding 10 people interested in this service that will pay you before the work is done, and then you have the money to buy to solar panels, creating a low initial investment for this business idea. 3. Community Generator/ Energy Supply Control Inspired by the previous business idea of installing home solar panels. This business idea involved developing electrical generators that can store extra power for a small community. For this idea, one could approach different communities in Indian cities or towns to find the groups that need this. This business idea for India sprouts from the problem that utility companies have of providing energy consistently and reliably to every person in the country. There is also a heavy reliance on coal that will eventually need to be shifted to electricity for sustainability. 4. Internet infrastructure Building Company There is a significant growing demand for stronger and better internet throughout all of India. Although there are currently providers, there is a lack of internet speeds in the rural parts of India, and even some issues with connectivity from the larger corporations. This leaves the business idea for starting an internet infrastructure in perfect light to execute. Although this business idea is not low-cost, it would have a lot of positive impact on people and could make a lot of money. 5. India Culture E-Commerce Niche Store E-commerce is rapidly growing in India. This is mainly due to the access to cheap labor and goods, as well as the ability to ship internationally at a fraction of the cost it used to years ago. This business idea specifically relates to selling cultural items from India. Given that many people around the world appreciate the culture in India, many would like to have authentic pieces of art in their homes. By setting up an E-commerce store to fulfill this, you can solve that problem. The company would be low-cost to start, and you could begin by partnering with your favorite street vendors. 6. Warehouse/ Inventory Management for E-Commerce Again, playing off the e-commerce trend, the warehouse management company for e-commerce would provide fulfillment for the e-commerce stores. Instead of an e-commerce store setting up their own distribution channels, buying fleet trucks, and warehouses to store the goods, this company would do it all for them. You could start by buying large pieces of land to hold people’s goods. Then use a shipping company to send them to the places they need to go, this business idea could make money from holding people’s goods in the warehouse. As well, you could charge for each shipment sent. 7. Last-Mile Delivery Solution Company In India, many shipping companies are facing the problem of having extreme difficulties providing delivery services to some rural areas. This is because the road infrastructure is not developed enough, or it is just very far from everything else. With this idea, you can provide the last mile delivery solutions by setting up a warehouse on the edge of the city limits. Then, once the other shipping company gets there, you handle the final miles of the trip. This may involve buying a fleet of scooters or shipping trucks to deliver the shipments for the last couple miles. Places where regular shipping companies are not willing to do. This company would need some investment to fund the warehouse at the outside city limits, as well as vehicles or drones for the last-mile delivery service. 8. Mobile wallet payment solution Cash is a huge part of the business transaction in India. People are more comfortable using cash than other payment methods. Until now. The growth of mobile payment solutions is ripe for extreme growth. A significant portion of the population have smartphones, and rely on them to communicate, do research, and watch entertainment. This business idea would require a decent amount of startup capital, however, because this is directed for business in India, there is a wealth of programmers and coders that one would have access to. Making the startup costs lower, and more reasonable. 9. Compliance & Regulations Management for E-Commerce Stores Like I mentioned before, e-commerce business ideas are ready to blow-up in India due to multiple factors positively influencing the market. With this, comes a lot of compliance that need to be followed. This company would provide those solutions to other e-commerce companies so they could operate legally. Since the government is always looking at new laws to implement in the business environment, this idea would help many other entrepreneurs navigate the field of compliance and regulations. This is a low cost business that could be executed by using only yourself and your knowledge of the industry regulations. 10. Blockchain Tracked Bank Ledger for E-Commerce Transactions The blockchain is a growing technology, and is going to become an essential part of the business in the Indian marketplace in the coming years. The government has set up support funds to help the development of technologies like this and the Internet of Things, leaving this business idea ripe for making money. The blockchain tracking bank ledger would allow e-commerce store owners to track where their payments are coming from, verify they are secure, and be able to accept money faster. There is a large problem with the current cash on delivery where the money is only collected once the goods are delivered. This creates a large cash flow problem for stores that could be solved using this trustworthy and verified technology.

So, i decided to celebrate it in a special way. So, to make my birthday special I wanted to donate some money for the good cause, to distribute food packets in slum areas and to the children ,but I didn't have the amount in my account and suddenly I got a call from my parents and they asked \\"Don't wanna donate this time?\\" and then I asked papa to send money. My parents always say that “No one has ever become poor from giving.” Preparing food and distributing it is quite a hectic task because I didn't have resources like Workers and van for food preparation and Distribution. So to make it possible i contacted a Foundation. With the Help of the foundation I made my birthday special. And “I have found that among it's other benefits, giving also sanctifies the soul.” After receiving the photos of the distribution and birthday wish video by children my mood lifted up.

Let’s contemplate three simple scenarios to illustrate: The man raped the woman (yes, marital rape is a thing). Nobody in their right mind is going to give a rapist a child. You’re just rewarding rape. The woman should be allowed to abort if she chooses. The rapist should get zero say in anything.The woman’s doctor has informed her that the pregnancy is very high risk and there’s a high chance she might die. Why should this man be allowed to pass a death sentence over his partner? Would you be happy if your wife or partner could decide to kill you at any time? No. Again, the woman should be allowed to protect her life if she chooses.The woman knows darned well that they can’t afford this child, and that it would be a financial disaster for the family. She wants this child, but runs the numbers again and again, and no matter how many costs she cuts she knows they’ll be out on the street in 6 months or less, and starving. They’ll probably die. The baby will almost certainly die. She decides that having an abortion is the only possible decision. It hurts. She wants this child. Her heart breaks. She knows they live in a country where even a minor medical emergency can put people in poverty for the rest of their lives, and childbirth isn’t a minor procedure and has major long-term costs. … why would she share this heartbreak with her husband or partner? But her partner finds out and insists he can do it. But she’s been over the finances a dozen times, and frankly her partner is just wrong. He’s just making a heartbreaking decision even harder. These are the details that so-called “pro-lifers” (more accurately anti-choice facists) like to ignore. And they’re what is important. Anti-choice rhetoric relies on gross over-simplifications of what is a difficult, often heart-breaking, and intensely personal, decision. These simplifications cross the line from being just simplifications to outright lies. Should a woman discuss their decision with their husband or partner? It should be her choice. Because you don’t know what she’s dealing with. You don’t know a darned thing about her situation. But anti-choicers want to pass dumb simplistic laws that force women to do things that make an already difficult situation a thousand times worse. That’s just torturing women. It’s blatant misogynisitic bullshit. There is no debate here, not when you actually learn about people’s real situations. But the anti-choice brigade don’t want to get into the details, because they know darned well that no sane or reasonable person would support their policies then."},{"instruction":"What are Facebook Marketplace Categories?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Facebook Marketplace] [URL: https://poweradspy.com/facebook-marketplace-categories-marketing/][LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://poweradspy.com/facebook-marketplace-categories-marketing/][LINKED_TEXT: Categories] [URL: https://poweradspy.com/facebook-marketplace-categories-marketing/] is a structured way of organizing and classifying types of products and services that users can buy, sell, or trade on the Facebook Marketplace platform.

What is wrong in admitting it is only Sanskrit and not a separate language?","output":"Just as Hindi doesn’t sound right when it replaces Sanskrit in Vedic hymns, Sanskrit doesn’t sound good when it replaces Hindi in Bollywood songs. There are several reasons to not consider Hindi synonymous with Sanskrit. First off, many linguists don’t even consider Hindi a descendant of Sanskrit- the dominant academic position is that essentially all modern Indo-Aryan languages are derived not from Sanskrit but from Prakrits, vernacular languages contemporaneous to Sanskrit (most scholars consider Sanskrit as the language of the social and religious elite: denied to the masses by said elite). Sanskrit is also conceived in academic eyes as a static, semi-artificial language; it was frozen in time by Panini’s rules, rendered unable to evolve into new languages and dialects as natural languages do. If we were to consider Hindi as a descendant of Sanskrit, there are still a lot of reasons not to consider it as synonymous with Sanskrit. Hindi incorporates a lot of Persian and Arabic loanwords, for example. Hindi also has a higher tendency than Sanskrit towards monosyllabic words and simplification of consonant clusters. Sanskrit and Hindi also differ in terms of grammar. All in all, Hindi has diverged a lot from Sanskrit over time: it is a natural outcome of linguistic evolution for a language to come into its own. The reason we don’t call Hindi Sanskrit is the same reason why we don’t call Sanskrit Proto-Indo-European: languages are often distinct in important ways from their ancestors."},{"instruction":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","output":"Dear Karen, Mind your own business."},{"instruction":"f an atheist doesn't believe in God, do they also not believe in Satan?","output":"Of course not"},{"instruction":"LPU good for taking admission in the CSE branch?","output":"Yes, it is worth to take admission in LPU.

So an explanation, what happens when you delete a file, the file is marked as deleted so that section can be written over. Now another fact, when you store a file, program, folder. The files are not written on the hard disk at the same location at least not always. You can have a disk that has sectors each sector is let’s say 16 megabytes in size, well you have a 32 megabyte file(note sectors are usually smaller then this, I am just using this as an easy example) you can have the first 16mb of the file stored in sector 100 and the second half stored in sector 850, or even worse, since some sectors may be storing other files, you can have first 4mb of the file in sector 100, 16mb so 4.1–20mb stored in sector 850 and the rest stored in sector 400, in other words they don’t have to be all in subsequent sectors in order, this is why you delete a file, start writing more stuff to the disk, go to recover the deleted file and get only part of the file back. Now once a file that you deleted is written over with another file, no one not even the FBI can recover the file, this is assuming that the entire file is over written. Most of the time when law enforcement recovers files they get part of the files or most of the file, because all the file was not written over by other data, also to note that even though you delete a file, when you write more data, the space you recovered from marking as deleted may not be used by the system right away, it could take days or even weeks sometimes before that space is used. If you wanted to delete everything on a hard drive and make it so no one could recover the deleted data, then use a formatting option called 0(zero) out, also known as low level format. What this does is after deleting the drive, it goes back and writes all zeros to the disk, so everything is overwritten with zeros, after that the disk is deleted once again and then formatted and file system written to the disk. Now if you were to take that drive the only data you would be able to recover would be all zeros. Which would be completely useless. Now if you could force your OS to instruct the kernel to tell the hard disk to write all data in sequence then to tell the system to write new data in any space recovered from marked deleted files, then you could prevent law enforcement from recovering data. The only thing is this would require you to be running an operating system you made yourself, and that would require new file types in some cases where the law enforcement would be unable to view anyway. It would be too much of a hassle."},{"instruction":"w can type I diabetes be effectively explained to children in a nonscary way?","output":"Kids are far less scared than we think, typically. We have a natural instinct to shield them from information that is scary TO US. But to them, it is helpful and not that scary. I would talk about “the pancreas.” I would say that right around the belly button area is something called a pancreas. The pancreas makes insulin and helps us use the food that we eat. But with diabetes, the pancreas isn’t making that insulin! Then we say that SUGAR (also called glucose) is in most food. We need glucose to live, but too much glucose can make us very sick! When the pancreas is not making insulin, our body isn’t using the sugars for energy, and so the glucose sugar gets too high in the blood and makes us really sick! But don’t worry, we can get insulin in pens now! We have to think like a pancreas and decide how much insulin we need to keep our body healthy! This depends on TWO THINGS? 1-How much food we eat; and 2-How much exercise we do. Getting sick from too much sugar is bad. But we can also get sick from not enough sugar! That is why we need to CHECK how much sugar is in our blood! We can outsmart the sicks by keeping our glucose numbers right around 100 before eating!!!! Let’s play a game where we keep the numbers where we want them! When our sugar numbers are close to normal, we won’t get sick! We just need to keep those numbers where we want them! Another great way to keep the numbers normal is with an insulin pump! Focus on how they can avoid getting sick, whst “getting sick” looks like for high or low sugars, and how to play with food and exercise. Try to make it as game-like as possible. Make sure they know what numbers are dangerous for getting sick and when they should tell an adult to get help."},{"instruction":"f slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?","output":"At least until 1930 if the American Civil War was averted.

We were already very tired. We were getting enough sleep. The power goes out around 2 am. So we woke up. My husband gets up. He wakes up when the lights go out. But after a while the light comes on. They also fall asleep. After some time, the sound of banging on the outside door is heard. He wakes me up as to who is at night at this time. I thought that he must be speaking like this in his sleep, but after some time I also heard some voice. When I woke my husband, he looked outside and found that no one was there. But another scary thing came to the fore that the light of the bedroom below was burning. Every day we sleep with the bedroom lights off. So how is it burning? Different types of thoughts were coming in our mind like this. There is no one else in the house except the two of us. Because we were not at home for 7 days, no one has come inside the house? I was very scared what to do. My house is a little far from the city, not many houses are built nearby. We both dared to leave the room. He has looked at the whole house with a big stick. We don't see anything. So many questions were coming in our mind that after all, who knocked on the door and turned on the light cone of the bedroom. And some time before that the power would have gone further. We were both trembling with fear. After some time the watchman of our colony makes two rounds in the night. We waited for him to come, we sat and watched by the window. Told him everything that was happening and asked him if there was anyone nearby who knocked on our door. He looked around and couldn't find anything. I had called my friend earlier and talked to him. He explained to us that if there is no one in the house then there is nothing to be afraid of. Sometimes we come back home after many days, on the first day we feel some fear in our own house. The same thing happened to us that night. We did not understand who knocked on the door. One of us lit the light in the bedroom and went to sleep. And the same night the electricity also goes out. You get all the luck. And an atmosphere of fear is created. But I saw that my husband was not afraid of anyone. They have courage. It is the responsibility of the husband.

Military training is mostly body weight exercises: push ups, sit ups, jumping jacks and so much running. It’s not designed to add mass, it’s designed provide stamina. Being strong really isn’t that big of an advantage in the current military; if it takes two people to move something the Army will provide five, manpower is cheap there. Being able to walk for hours, get on station and perform the mission is critical; this takes stamina. And the guys that do that best, every single time, are the skinny, wiry guys.

The third was just a “shit happens” moment. #1) We were performing in an outdoor natural bowl-type amphitheater. The local chapter of the VFW was up above us, around the sides of the bowl, with the cannon and guns. Rehearsal went okay. Performance did not. The program was fairly long, with 1812 as the concluding work. Most of the VFW guys apparently got bored waiting, and were passing the time in their own way. The first cannon shot was more or less on cue, but nothing followed for a long while. Then here and there a few random shots happened. Nothing big. At the end, the tepid applause from the audience was only to be expected, but what happened next was completely UNexpected. The guns started firing! Loud, constant, unrelenting. We hit the decks with our instruments. When eventually the firing stopped, we went up to look. We saw more empty booze bottles than we knew the town even had! #2) Also 1812, though more embarrassing than exciting. An outdoor performance in a local park, of a community orchestra that hired a few of us as ringers. There is a cadence leading to the final melody that everyone recognizes, where Tchaikovsky deliberately composed it to slow down without doing a ritard. (The score and parts clearly notated as non ritardando.) But this conductor kept conducting a ritard anyway, which made it impossible to play the composer’s rhythm. In the performance he exaggerated the slowdown to the point that it all ground to a halt, and pathetic silence. He yelled at us; we started at a point nearer the end, and finished more or less together. #3) Nothing to do with ineptitude here, just mother nature. The theater had a solid fire curtain over the stage, for obvious safety reasons. It was meant to drop down straight and fast, automatically, if anything triggered it. We were performing a concert, while a storm raged outside: downpour, lightning, and thunder. A sudden thunderclap occurred, right overhead to judge by the loudness. This sent the fire curtain down to the stage. The seconds and violas were right on target. Luckily they had time to move. But it separated the orchestra. Winds, brass, and perc behind, firsts, celli, and basses in front, and seconds and violas scattered. That pretty much stopped the concert. The patrons were offered ticket refunds, but almost no one requested one. As one regular remarked, it was the most exciting concert she could remember attending!

Because most of its revenue comes from fees it charges users to deposit and trade funds, the valuations of the crypto exchange fluctuates in close correlation with Bitcoin’s price. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company laid it out: “Our net revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform.” Alternately, investors could focus on companies that are bullish on Bitcoin and have substantial holdings. Tesla Inc., for example, made a large purchase of more than 1.5 billion. Other public companies that have substantial holdings include MicroStrategy Inc., an enterprise software firm that purchased billions; and Galaxy Digital Holdings, with hundreds of millions.

It was shot from a recently captured Iraqi police station, and showed box after box of American mortar shells and bullets that appeared shiny and new. Several Humvees, apparently not long out of the packing crates, sat abandoned nearby. “This is how we get our weapons,” the narrator said in Arabic. “The Iraqi officials beg the Americans for weapons, and then they leave them here for us.” and [LINKED_TEXT: New York Times Magazine] [URL: http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-real-problem-in-iraqhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/11/magazine/isis-middle-east-arab-spring-fractured-lands.html?_r=0https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2016%2F08%2F11%2Fmagazine%2Fisis-middle-east-arab-spring-fractured-lands.html%3F_r]: […] beyond the traditional Kurdish antipathy for the regime in Baghdad, was what the Iraqi Army collapse in 2014 brought down on the [Kurds]. The Iraqis, by abandoning their American-supplied heavy weaponry and vehicles to ISIS — in most cases, they didn’t even have the presence of mind to destroy it — had virtually overnight converted the guerrilla force into one of the best-equipped armies in the region, and it was the Kurds who paid the price. One might argue that this falls more under “capturing conquests of war” than “running out of your own ammunition and taking that of your enemies,” but it struck me as odd that no one mentioned a pretty important instance of soldiers very unafraid to use enemy weapons."},{"instruction":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","output":"The opposite of democrat politicians and their brain dead voters!"},{"instruction":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","output":"Remember to verify the copyright status and terms of use for any content you access on these websites to ensure that you are downloading and using the material legally.

A factory edge can always be improved even from the most high quality tool makers. There are a lot of tutorials out there. Personally, I sharpen by hand using a coarse diamond stone, 1200 water stone, an 8000 waterstone and a green compound (Chromium Oxide) honing compound on a strop. With this combination, you can get a mirror edge that is shaving sharp. That said, a 1200 stone alone used well will give you an edge at least as good as a factory edge. The real trick is to make sure you maintain the proper angle and keep sharpening with a grit until you feel a burr on the flat side. Only then move to the next grit/stone. If you do that, you will be able to get a great edge."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection?","output":"Lucid dreaming happens naturally, whereas astral projection usually needs a guide, someone with hypnosis skills."},{"instruction":"Do you believe in karma?

You should know how to use these services. With them, you can move much faster, reduce cost and time to market. The days when cloud was just infrastructure and storage is long gone. It’s hard to keep up with all the new offerings from all the major cloud providers, but sticking with one and keeping somewhat up to date with it is fine.Distributed systems. In the cloud, you will build distributed systems. You should have an understanding of basic concepts like concurrency, horizontal scaling and the CAP theorem.Messaging. You should know how to have your services communicate via message queues and ensure that messages are processed in correct order, which can be pretty tricky in a distributed system.DevOps. This is really important when building systems in the cloud, because you’re going to be deploying a bunch of different resources to a large number of servers. Learning how to set up CI/CD pipelines and templating all your cloud resources is a skill that will pay itself off with interest.Programming. This should be a given, but you need to know at least one general-purpose programming language, a scripting language for automation purposes and potentially several query languages.NoSQL. There are various storage options in the public cloud. To scale better, you often need to move from traditional RDBMS to document databases, wide-column stores or data lakes.Cost estimation. This can be pretty tricky with cloud computing. The pricing models are often complicated and confusing. You should nevertheless familiarize yourself with them and try to understand how different resources scale in terms of cost."},{"instruction":"Do you believe in karma?

And the proof of that is, abolished or not, slavery existed long after 1865 . . . in fact, it still exists!!! Now, hold on, don't change the channel yet—it's time for us to discuss something . . . We are not each other’s natural enemies, in fact, we all share a common adversary . . . because we’re all aware, I assume, that there are those who benefit from our division. If it weren’t for the financial motive attached to racism, it never would have even been close to this big a problem . . . I am white, and I want to say something because I see something that runs rampant all over quora, social media, the internet . . . everywhere. For those of us who are white and feel that we are fair minded, even if we don't honestly believe that we are racist, or feel that we ever see it, that does not mean that it does not exist. We must realize that, if we are being honest with ourselves, it's undeniable . . . and we must also realize that unless we are black (or another minority) we really don't know what it's like. You cannot. I cannot. To understand anything about the trajectory of slavery, we must consider the momentum of history . . . The people that wanted to maintain their legal right to own slaves were hell bent on doing so. They fought a war to retain those rights, a vicious, bloody war against their own countrymen in their own backyards. They died and they sent their children to die. They attempted to re-make themselves into an entirely new nation . . . even though they were the underdogs, and they knew it. These were serious people with serious intent, immersed in a life and death struggle that was, to them, of almost biblical proportion. They had a death grip on slavery, and they weren't going to let it go… And they didn’t. People like that, people that were willing to wage war to maintain a slave economy, they were the same then as they are now, the same as they will forever be, they're going to drag everybody into their mess while they torture, exploit, lie and suppress, all so they can reap whatever benefits, no matter the human cost in misery and death...people like that are gonna find the loopholes. They're going to exploit the loopholes, you better believe it, just like they were little nooses made of words. Now, everybody understand… These people didn’t go anywhere, this genetic strain didn’t just disappear in a 150 years, it’s still here…it’s in our country’s DNA. Many of them are the people that own this country, or aspire to, and they will take everything we surrender . . . who am I talking about? I'm talking about the people who would enslave us all of they could. They exist, believe that. This is not paranoia, this is not conspiracy theory…look at the state of our country, the politics, the cultural rift, the wealth gap, what does your intuition tell you? Look at the history… You think slavery ended with the Civil War? If so, you’ve never read the Thirteenth Amendment… Here it is: AMENDMENT XIII Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. That’s it, the entire amendment. Those are the very words that outlaw slavery, decree it as unconstitutional…and you saw it, right? “except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted...” The day the 13th Amendment was ratified was the day it became a crime to have black skin in America! Oh yes...that is the truth! In the wake of the Civil War, with the South decimated and all the slaves freed, the Union Generals decree that southern states could lease out their convicts to aid in the work of reconstruction. What do you think happened next? Blacks began to be arrested immediately, piled into prisons on trumped up charges, trespassing, loitering, disturbing the peace. This is not only when the seeds of systemic racism were beginning to be sown into America's legal system, but also when the character of the American Justice system began taking its form, heartless, implacable, dehumanized, and a ready tool at the disposal of business interests. This practice came to be known as convict leasing, and in many ways, it was worse than slavery . . . 25% of all prisoners, mostly black, died while serving their sentences, tortured or worked to death. Cotton, in those days, was like oil is now, it was widespread and lucrative. In 1898, 73% of Alabama's entire annual state revenue came from convict leasing. Let's stop and consider for a moment what it would be like to be worked to death . . . One out of four. A thing like this doesn’t happen naturally…not without hatred, not without the seeds of real hatred being sown by those few at the top, who are reaping the lion’s share of the benefits, indoctrinating the public at large into cooperating with this unnatural and dehumanizing practice. Besides being dehumanizing, practically speaking, free labor is never a good thing for those who wish to earn a living as a paid laborer. In order to induce the public into cooperating with slavery, it was necessary to continually propagate the corrosive thinking that is racism. Divide and conquer! We all know what that means...but do we KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? Divide and conquer...it's not something that they do to them. It's what's being done to us! Oh, yes! You know it...and you always have… But how? The color of our skin...the place that we live...the God that we do or don't worship … the people we choose to love, but most of all... The crumbs they leave for us to fight over. We're divided by the crumbs . . . The crumbs they leave for us . . . To fight over! They know it! And so do you! CUT TO . . . Terrell Don Hutto running the Ramsey Cotton Plantation for the Texas Department of Corrections. Some fifteen thousand mostly black convicts are forced to pick cotton from dawn to dusk. Hutto was turning a nice profit for the state, so nice, in fact, that he would move on to take over the entire Arkansas prison system, which was comprised entirely of plantations. Torture was commonplace. Pick faster, or be starved out, given no water...Pick faster, or be thrown in a pitch black hole with six other men and only enough room for one to lie down at a time...Pick faster, or be strung up over night by your thumbs while standing on the tips of your toes. Fire hoses were used on those who became hysterical and started gnawing through their arms. This was 1967. That's right, 1967. This was just 53 years ago, many reading this were alive at this time...and as for Terrell Don Hutto, he would go on to be condemned as a torturer by a federal judge then partner up with two other men in Tennessee in 1983 to launch the modern day Private Prison industry by establishing America’s first private prison in decades, Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic) which has grown into a multi-billion dollar corporation traded on the New York Stock Exchange . . . These people are still here, lying to us…pitting us against each other. They would enslave us all if they could, trust that. To this day, they seek to cultivate slave labor any way they can… You want proof? Here's the proof… You're looking right at it, holding it in your hand… You think the device displaying this was made by somebody that looked like this… . Or like this… We shouldn't kid ourselves, we’re all complicit in the enslavement of our fellow man; we just keep it out of our minds. The wealthiest man in the world, by far, delivers to those in the wealthiest countries that which is wrought by the labor of the poorest peoples in the world. Our goodies may come piling in from Amazon, but they come by way of D’Nile . . . I’m not trying to make anyone feel bad, it’s a huge, complicated world that is, in almost every respect, completely out of our hands…but let it put things in perspective, let it remind us that we have many, many more things in common than we have that are different, so that we understand that we are all in this together, all of us have been lied to and none of us is without guilt. The people that own this country are not stupid, complacent or naive...and they have all the resources and every advantage they need… The rest of us, we need to smarten up. We need to come together. Liberals need to realize that people in the working class, industrialized regions of the U.S. feel abandoned by the country they believed in, the country they worked and fought to make a better place for their children. These are the people that put in the hours. These are the people that fought the wars. They did the dirty work and they have been lied to and deceived. Conservatives have to realize...that liberals are just like you! They don't spend all day watching Oprah eating kale salads…they get up, work all day, try to keep the bills paid, put food on the table, take care of their families, just like you...but most of all, conservatives should understand that what's been happening to you is not the fault of liberals...liberals didn't do it to you, liberal policies didn't do it to you, and neither did blacks or Hispanics…you've been lied to, just like they have been lied to! The most important thing, I've come to realize, is how much money and effort has been put into misleading conservatives about how liberals view them and distorting liberal views in general. We are on the same side . . . conservatives, how many of you work or have worked for Walmart? Listen, the Walton family, the heirs to the Walmart fortune, are the richest non-royal family in the world. How many small businesses did Walmart drive into bankruptcy? Anybody remember? The answer is many. How many Walmart employees have had to subsidize their income with food stamps because Walmart refused to pay them a living wage? The answer is many. This means that we, the taxpayers, are making up the difference for those who work for some of the wealthiest people in America, because they won't pay their employees enough money to make ends meet . . . how's this for a better solution: PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES ENOUGH MONEY TO LIVE ON, YOU'RE THE RICHEST FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY, YOU PRICKS! These are liberal views the conservatives are actively working to keep your wages low. You think it's any different with Bezo's? He's in line to cost us more jobs than China. Single handedly. What's the trade off? A bunch of bottom of the barrel, what's called \\"last mile\\" delivery jobs, that skirt the minimum wage laws by illegally designating employees as independent contractors, working for subsidiaries of Amazon, that are illegally designated as independent businesses, all so the drivers can get screwed out of being paid a decent wage, or recieve benefits, having to urinate in bottles to keep up with unrealistic, high pressure expectations, for a couple hundred dollars a day. Bezos . . . soon to be the world's first trillionaire. Should we keep celebrating that? There is a handful of people in America, maybe a dozen, who have a trillion dollars . . . we need to smarten up, we need to band together, black, white, brown, yellow, red — we are getting swallowed up, we need to work together . . . we need to trust each other-- Because it's going to get worse with automation, much worse. That's where our jobs have gone, where they’re going . . . third world labor and automation. The wealthy elite are not the cause of all of society’s problems, but let’s not kid ourselves about Corporate America, let’s not be confused by the slick campaigns of PR departments and ad agencies depicting retired couples sipping coffee on sailboats… We saw what happened in 2008 when controls were taken away from the financial sector…how many people lost their homes? 10 million! Now homelessness in many large cities is worse than ever. We saw the way tobacco companies lied about cigarettes not being harmful or addictive for decades. We’ve seen a justice system swell into a mass incarceration right alongside the development of a burgeoning private prison industry…how many people are in prison now? 2.2 million! Slave owners. Convict leasers. Exploiters of third world labor. Predatory lenders. Mass incarcerators. Those who aspire to own slaves are still with us; they will take everything we surrender and use anything they can against us. Racism is a tool they use against us, to distract us, to divide us. If you are a racist, they are using your own hatred against you. Believe it, you are playing right into their hands. If we are fighting with each other, we are divided. They’re scared to death of us uniting!!! This is a democracy; we have all the power…they just don’t want us to realize it. Racism is their tool and they’re using it against us ALL. Slavery still exists, will continue to exist, for as long as we are willing to hate one another, for no good reason at all."},{"instruction":"f life grew out of organic sludge, why haven't we seen another example of that kind of creation?","output":"There is all kinds of life thriving in the sludge in the drain pipes below your toilet.

They clustered there on a bench like schoolboys readying for a class photoshoot, giggling in bloodied white lab coats while being draped with dismembered baby-dolls and chunks of raw beef. As Bob took shots, glimpses of a wretched future streamed through his mind like distracting flashes from his camera. His heart jumped, beating as if he had leaped from one spot to another just to capture the most surreal image ever. He was even surprised. So astonished that he could not believe what he was seeing or hearing. \\"Decapitate Paul's head!\\" yelled John while moving his thumb across his friend's throat. Bob simply gave him a nod. He just couldn't reply because he was documenting everything through the lens. He had no idea that this conceptual artwork would become an infamous \\"pop art\\" collectible. \\"This is gross!\\" protested George. \\"This isn't cool anymore, it's naive and stupid.\\" He looked at them one by one, soliciting for support to stop the sick joke that they've wanted to be serialized but got nothing. \\"Don't bore us with the usual, George,\\" countered John, instigating that their dark humor should be the theme for the tableau. \\"We're bigger than Jesus anyway.\\" \\"Bro, it's not that offensive,\\" opined Paul, convincing George to play along. \\"Yeah, think of the Vietnam conflict,\\" added John. \\"War is cruel and the sheep out there accepted it, so they'll accept this too.\\" Ringo had nothing to spit out. But John was wrong. There was public outrage against the album's cover design. Capitol Records had printed some 750,000 covers but the company's owner requested that they be returned to them for repackaging. \\"If they had asked me about the Butcher shot, it would have been less frightening. It wasn't my fault that it reached America. That photo with other images was snatched from me!\\" explained Bob forty years later during an interview. \\"Do you know why I did that? Beatlemania is bullshit idolatry! I want to show everyone that they are not gods. So I surrounded them with slabs of meat because they are flesh and blood. Those dolls there are like their female fans who are willing to tear them apart. Offstage those girls would have ripped them to pieces!\\" Despite the hullabaloo over the Beatles Butcher cover which costs 15 cents in 1966, its First State market value after fifty years rose to nearly one million dollars! Post-interview, when the photog's camera flashed to capture Bob, he suddenly returned to 1964. He was shocked to find himself in a hotel in Australia. There he held a VIP ticket and a weird memo saying he would meet the Fab Four for the first time. At that momentous event, he was approached by a gentleman named Brian and, surprisingly, he applied to him as a manager. \\"Sorry, I'm not a Beatle. I don't want to be managed,\\" Bob replied without hesitation. \\"I would love to shoot all four of them though.\\" ■ Before you believe the speculative fiction you’ve read above, let me introduce you to the six characters: Bob (Robert Whitaker) - Beatles' official photographer for a triptych art called \\"A Somnambulant Adventure.\\" Brian Epstein - Beatles' manager The Beatles / Fab Four - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr All of them have something to do with \\"one of the most widely recognized valuable albums in the world\\" known as the \\"Butcher cover\\" [from the album Yesterday and Today by the Beatles].

Now we have two objects/ships, one whose all parts are replaced and other one created by all replaced parts, which one is real? The answer is clear and short and stated with one statement that clears all ambiguity, \\"All parts of first ship is replaced but not its identity, and all parts of second ship are assembled from previous replaced parts but it does not get the identity, so first ship is original ship\\" Answer seem to be that simple until we consider an eg. where we open all parts of a ship and assemble back them all in same ship, so does ship loose its identity, no it doesnt, so in this perspective second ship is original ship...

It’s something I only recently brought into my practice. What does confidence have to do with math? Confidence is an emotion. Math is cold dead facts. What does emotion have to do with learning math? I’m not expert in this but my expertise is more extensive than your average spectator of education. I described my 25 years of teaching experience in an answer a couple years ago [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #qUeJf] . Mathematics is not emotional but the learning of mathematics can be very emotional. So many math students have math anxiety. This is an emotional fear of doing mathematics. It is rooted in a fear of putting oneself out there and being wrong. When someone experiences anxiety their brain shuts down. It’s called a threat response. When someone experiences this they are not in a state of mind to learn new things. So how do you fight math anxiety? An important component is teaching the student to be aware of how they personally learn mathematics. Awareness of one’s own thought process is called metacognition. So I ask my students “how confident are you?” as a way to invite a metacognitive discussion. It encourages the student to look inward . If they are not confident I want them to practice exploring what it is they are not confident about. And then the important part. I want my students to be able to express their confusion in words out loud. This is important because of the way the brain works. Human beings learn by forming pathways among the neurons in the brain (here is where i’m not an expert but there is a lot of neuroscience research around this). Speaking about ones learning aids in the formations of these pathways. If I set these exercises up right I not only get my students learning but I get feedback about where I need to point the lesson next. Do I need to clarify some points or can I go to the next exploration. So why am I saying this? Well if you dig past the media articles about this “math is racist” controversy you see that a lot of prescriptions around changing of teaching styles. A lot of the discussions and debates being discussed in the literature centers around metacognitive discussion and around setting up a safe space for those and other affective domain exercises. On top of that i’m seeing a lot of answers to this question that simply state that there is nothing to debate about mathematics. You either get the right answer or your wrong. And that is true. However, effective teaching of mathematics is greatly assisted by allowing discussions around the mathematics. People outside of the classroom may interpret that as nonsensical debating of cold hard fact based mathematics. But if you come into my classroom on a good day (i’m still in the process of reforming my teaching methods) what you will see is me giving merit to wrong answers. Not because the wrong answers are just as right but because wrong answers can actually be more valuable to learners than right ones. Wrong answers in mathematics almost always have some sound logic behind then. And it can be an important exercise to separate out the good from the bad in a wrong answer … at least if the student who came up with that wrong answer showed their work. But the only way i’m going to get those valuable teaching tools is if I create an environment … dare I say it … a safe space for students to be wrong. A space where wrong answers are not shameful. So what do I think about a teacher who teaches that math is racist? I think that this is someone who didn’t read past the headlines. This teacher needs to read more about culturally responsive teaching and learning. I’m a huge fan of civil rights leader Robert Moses who turned his attention to math education as a way to bring about racial equity. Effective teaching of mathematics does require a lot more psychology and a lot more equitable practices than simply teaching what is right and what is wrong. I also don’t think it’s wrong to explore the equity gaps in math achievement. But those gaps don’t end with thinking math is racist. That shuts the learning down. Those gaps close when we create math learning environments that give space for metacognitive discussion and yes verbalizing debate about the mathematics. It’s only been a few years since I really moved to a more student centered approach to my teaching. I always tried to make my classes interactive. But in the last few years I’ve had a much better window in how my students were thinking. I’ve seen students make extraordinary connections that I rarely saw when I lectured. I’ve seen students make extraordinary growth throughout a semester in ways that I only ever saw from students who regularly came to office hours in the past.

Some people believe the abuse is their fault for not meeting their partner's unrealistic expectations. They see it as a sign of love that they are taking care of what needs to be taken care of without ever expecting anything in return. For some, threats are enough for them to behave exactly how their partner wants them to behave even if all other aspects of the relationship are lacking. And sometimes power imbalances within relationships make it difficult for partners who have obviously suffered more abuse or mental health struggles, to leave because they feel like everything would go downhill if they left. For others, these painful stories lead them back into healthy relationships with higher quality partners who can be trusted and who reciprocate the love they are given. Leaving an unhealthy or abusive relationship can be very difficult, but it is possible. Here are a few tips for those who are considering leaving: -Talk to someone you trust about what you're going through. It can be helpful to have an objective person to talk to who will support your decision to leave. -If you are worried about protecting yourself, try not to make any rash decisions that could put you in danger. Evaluate the situation and identify your partner's most common abusive behaviors/reactions. Then think of what you would do if they were triggered by something small, like a fight with friends or family, drinking, smoking, anger in general. -Go to therapy and talk about how you can cope with your triggers and deal with emotional outbursts. -Cut communication with your partner as much as possible. If you can, change all of your profile pictures on social media and any other way your partner knows how to contact you. -Make a safety plan and talk to your friends and family about what you're going through so they can help you if things get bad. -Take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. Eat healthy, exercise, get enough sleep, and find ways to decompress and de-stress. Having an abusive partner can be very isolating, especially if you're not sure whether the situation is abusive or not. It's important to remember that you are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help. If you're feeling suicidal or thinking about self-harm, please seek professional help. There are a number of hotlines and emergency numbers you can call if you feel like you want to hurt yourself or someone else."},{"instruction":"What are your choices of preference in NEET 2022 counseling?","output":"So with my marks I would not be getting any good colleges through AIQ…So I would only be participating in State counseling…for which the order is MCK(no chance)SSKM (no chance)R.G kar(no chance)NRS(no chance)CNMC (slight chance in the mopup or stray,but won't be participating)ESIC joka (will easily get it)Sagore Dutta (will get it)Burdwan (will get it)Then all the other district colleges So presently I'm confused between sagore Dutta and ESIC joka.…I know some will say Sagore Dutta is superior to ESIC based on the closing rank..But c'mon we all know judging a college by its closing rank is the WORST way to judge a college.

General dentistry, on the other hand, pertains to procedures that fix the regular dental problems like soreness in gums or toothache. Hence, the procedures that fall under general dentistry can be regular fillings, tooth extraction and dental cleaning. With modern advances in dentistry, cosmetic procedures can range from tooth colour enhancements, laminates, composite bonding, correction of the misalignment of the teeth etc. to digitally design your overall smile. The changes brought by various modalities of Dental procedures will give you that wow look! Digital Smile Designing One of the special reasons for calling FMS Dental the best cosmetic dental clinic in India is that a comprehensive smile assessment is carried out which begins with a thorough clinical evaluation of your smile. The cosmetic dentist interacts with the patients to find out what are their expectations. With the help of virtual planning software, the entire treatment procedure is planned out. Hence, DSD paves the way for the cosmetic dentist to decide which treatment approach suits the best in a particular case. Techniques Used During[LINKED_TEXT: Cosmetic Dental Treatments] [URL: https://www.fmsdental.com/cosmetic-dentistry-home/] The cosmetic problems related to teeth can be easily rectified by a wide range of dental procedures. Few of them are listed below- Composite Bonding- Composite bonding or dental bonding is the procedure used to repair chipped, cracked or misshaped teeth with the help of tooth-colored plastic material called as composite resins. This material is applied in layers and then hardened (polymerized) by a special activation light. Further with the specific finishing and polishing kit, shaping and polishing is done to give a life-like effect. Laminates and Dental Veneers – Thin shells of tooth-colored (ceramic) material cemented to teeth with cosmetic defects (like dark color, improper shape, gaps between teeth and minor crowding of teeth) can work wonders on your smile. These shells when made of porcelain are called as Laminates. Professional Teeth whitening – Through this innovative cosmetic procedure, your teeth can be made many shades lighter than the present shade as you wish. It takes just 45 minutes to get a WOW smile. Enamel Tooth Recontouring – Enamel recontouring can be called as the Midas touch of a cosmetic dentist wherein just the outermost layer of teeth called enamel is contoured minimally to reshape the teeth. Gum depigmentation – Dark gums are unesthetical as compared to the normal pink color. This kind of hyperpigmentation could develop due to several reasons like heredity and medicines. This procedure is helpful in making dark gums lighter in color. Gum contouring Gummy smile can be corrected with gum contouring. The cosmetic dental specialists uses LASERS to contour the gums to reduce visibility and achieve the right shape. Dental crowns – These are cap like structures that are also used to change the shape, structure and color of teeth. They cover the teeth completely. Botox Botox (Type A botulinum toxin) is a neuromodulator and is being used extensively in cosmetic procedures like wrinkle removal and correction of gummy smile (that is caused by a hyperactive lip). Orthognathic surgery In some cases, the defects are bone related and not just tooth-related. Then orthognathic surgery is considered to bring about repositioning of the jaws and correct the skeletal defects that are causing cosmetic issues.

Is the US economy heading for another recession? Will it be worse than the last time? Well, you might be witnessing these types of headlines all over the web, and this is all because US GDP fell by 1.4% by last quarter, stocks are dropping down, and Federal Reserve gears up to raise interest rates. This information clearly shows that the U.S. economic recession is coming again in the year 2022. Economists believe that the US financial crisis has been spreading worldwide. They predict that the US economy will welcome a recession for the second time after almost ten years of recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. But what is a Recession? And How can it affect your life? Is it something that you should be worried about? Not many people have a clear idea of what this word actually means. In this article, we will explore these questions and hopefully provide some answers. What does a recession mean? According to google dictionary, a recession is a period of decreased economic activity. More broadly, it can mean a reduction in economic output and employment. A recession is usually measured by calculating GDP growth and comparing it with previous economic periods. In short, A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. The first quarter of 2019 is expected to be positive, but the second quarter may see some contraction. The last time the US experienced a recession was during the financial crisis in 2008-2009 when GDP declined by 1.2% and unemployment rose from 5% to 10%. What are the signs that we are in a recession? The biggest sign would be if companies start to cut staff. If this happens en mass, it could signal that companies are worried about the future prospects for their business. This happened at the start of 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed and many other financial institutions were forced to lay off staff. Other signs include: Consumers starting to save more and spend less on non-essential items (such as holidays, new clothes, etc). The housing market slowing down or falling into depression as fewer people buy homes or rental properties. In a nutshell, if you're looking for signs of a recession then you should be on the lookout for: -A decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters -A fall in industrial production -An increase in the unemployment rate What Happens during a recession? The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private research organization, determines when recessions begin and end. The NBER defines a recession as \\"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP growth, real income growth, and employment.\\" A recession can be caused by many factors — such as rising interest rates or an increase in oil prices. Economists generally agree that recessions are started by shocks to the economy that cause demand to fall below supply levels. For example, if an oil crisis occurs, consumers will spend less money because they will be afraid that gasoline prices will continue to increase. Businesses may also reduce production if they expect consumers will buy fewer goods in the future. When this happens, companies start laying off workers because they don't need as many people to produce their goods. When companies lay off workers, those people have less money to spend on items like cars and clothes — so other businesses start laying off workers too! Soon everyone is out of work and there's no one left to buy anything at all!

Engage in regular physical activity: Cardiovascular exercise, such as running or cycling, and weight training can help burn fat and build muscle. Practice facial exercises: Certain exercises, such as smiling, puckering, and blowing kisses, can help tone the muscles in the face and jawline. Limit alcohol and tobacco use: Both alcohol and tobacco can contribute to water retention and puffiness in the face. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can cause the face to appear puffy and swollen.

To start a ketogenic diet, you should follow these basic principles: Reduce your carbohydrate intake: You should aim to consume less than 50 grams of carbohydrates per day. This will help your body enter a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of glucose.Increase your fat intake: You should consume healthy fats like olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds, as they will provide energy for your body.Eat moderate amounts of protein: You should consume moderate amounts of protein, which will help maintain your muscle mass while your body burns fat for energy.Avoid processed foods: Processed foods are often high in carbohydrates and unhealthy fats. Instead, focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, meat, and fish.Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help your body process the fat and protein you're consuming. As with any diet, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider before starting a ketogenic diet. They can provide guidance on whether it's safe for you and how to get started. The effectiveness of the ketogenic diet for weight loss can vary from person to person. Some studies have shown that people on a ketogenic diet lose more weight than those on a low-fat diet, but it's important to maintain a healthy, balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity to achieve optimal weight loss results."},{"instruction":"Did they ever prove that George Floyd intentionally used counterfeit money, and is there a way to posthumously charge Floyd with fraud?","output":"The police brutally murdered him.

If you are not sure who the fool is in a trade or complicated investment, there is likely a fool and that fool is likely to be you. Note: Investments are often different. ht [LINKED_TEXT: David Kressel] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Kressel] 2. If it's complicated, the salesperson is making a lot of money off you. 3. Annual fees, short term capital gains and losses, and performance fees can wreak havoc on returns. 4. Trust folks like John Bogle and Charlie Munger. Trust but verify just about everyone else. 5. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. 6. On average, asset allocation accounts for 90% of your returns. 7. Protect your downside risk. Invest with a margin of safety, use stop limits, buy puts, etc. 8. Cut your losses early and often. 9. Read Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger. 10. Glamour investments like Tesla stock are expensive. Instead, get a Tesla car. Its cheaper. 11. Most venture capital funds and hedge funds are not great at beating the market. Most can't even beat the S&P 500 or Russell 2000 over time. 12. The market is a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run. 13. Either diversify and index or be sure of your bets and go big when the opportunity strikes. 14. Avoid investing in things you don't understand. 15. Get it in writing. 16. Don't buy stuff the salesperson doesn't buy himself or herself. 17. Don't invest in illiquid ETFs or stocks. You will move the market against you when you build up your position. And when you sell. 18. Salespeople in finance are often disguised as product managers, business development, client services, etc. Be careful. 19. No, you are not going to beat Goldman Sachs and Bridgewater at their game, so stop day trading and trying to predict macro trends. I worked on Wall Street for many years. The smartest people tended to be proprietary traders. Each time you trade, there is a good chance they are on the other side, picking you off. 20. If you don't know what you're doing, buy some Vanguard index funds or Berkshire Hathaway stock. 21. If you get inside information, it's either illegal or wrong. Don't trade on it. I had an ex-M&A banker from a top i-bank tip me off once. A good friend, too. I didn't trade on this. 22. Just because a company is great doesn't mean you should buy its stock. The stock may be not be a great deal. 23. Uncorrelated assets are often just another way for salespeople to make a huge profit off of you. 24. Understand what you are signing before you sign it. At Merrill Lynch I cut their investor letters on certain types of deals from about 15 pages to 2. I made sure the terms were just as, if not more, favorable to Merrill. Pretty plain English. Never got sued on any deal I worked on, out of hundreds if not thousands of deals and hundreds of billions in principal amount. 25. Don't buy annuities. There are much cheaper alternatives. Annuities are quite complicated to model and value for most people. Annuities look simple (7% for life, etc.) And they are a product the salesperson can get away with selling at high margin. Someone's making high margins off you when you buy, when you sell and every year you own it. 26. A particular stock or market can be overvalued or undervalued for several years at a time. Be patient. 27. Stop watching CNBC and Bloomberg unless you are a good proprietary trader. 28. A quick way to financial ruin is to day trade products you can't price and model, like futures, options. Another way is to trade on margin. 29. Most folks in the retail and high net worth financial space do not add much value. Some subtract a lot of value. Be careful. If you have doubts, just go to Vanguard. They take money at all levels, not just retail, so if you have 1m plus or 5m plus you will get good service. 30. If you can't hold an investment for at least a year, do the trade out of your retirement account to reduce taxes. 31. Investing can be hard and humbling, but trading is far worse. Either way, you have to know when to buy AND when to sell every time and then do it. 32. Investing and trading are completely different. Most people have no business trading. At all. In trading, there's no intramural league. The pros are everywhere, picking you off and taking advantage of your less superior trading skills. In investing, the intramural league is index funds. Admit you can't beat the market. So match it. After expenses and 40 years, your index fund will beat 99% of managed funds in the same sector. On Wall Street smart traders screwed up all the time, losing hundreds of millions, billions. Yes, they got fired. But then they usually got jobs at another bank. What are you going to do when you lose 80-100% of your net worth? 33. Sell when others are greedy. Buy when others are fearful. In 2011, many investors freaked out over Greece and the Fed's money printing. So they bought gold, sold stocks. I bought lots of Berkshire Hathaway then. 34. Don't dwell on your losses and mistakes. Learn from them and move on. Next. 35. Avoid leverage until you know what you are doing. Or if you are buying real estate and can take full advantage of the mortgage interest rate deduction. I would only borrow if you don't need the money. 36. Dollar cost average. It's hard to time the market, so set up an automatic purchase of the same amount, e.g., 100, each week or month and build up your portfolio. 37. If you read this far, thank you. I saved the best for last. Compounding is a powerful friend or enemy. Make it your friend. If you are borrowing money, compound interest can be a killer. If you are investing, you have no better friend than compounding. Especially if you invest early in life. Disclaimer: Feedback wanted. Biased. Not for reproduction. Not my final answer. Not advice.

Often, patients seeking cosmetic dentistry services aren’t doing so out of necessity or dental emrgencies They might feel insecure about a feature of their smile or face. For example, missing a few teeth usually won’t affect your overall health. But, it does affect the structure of your face and can lead to changes in your face’s muscles.A cosmetic dentistry treatment such as dental implants can fill the space of the missing teeth to prevent changes in your facial appearance. Cosmetic dentistry makes it easier for patients to chew, speak, and smile. The benefits of having a smile you adore are immense. General dentistry promotes the maintenance of your smile and offers services to maintain your teeth and gums healthy. Preventive dentistry, in general, can reduce your chances of needing some general dentistry procedures like root canals and fillings. Because missing teeth are more than a cosmetic dental concern, general dentistry also addresses tooth loss and smile restoration.

Okay. As “guest” in six or seven MHs in two countries, I have seen too much I wish l had not. Perhaps I am easily horrified? I admit, I am, which - part of why I ended up in these places. Nevertheless. One event, in a facility south of Chicago. This involved an elder man suffering from dementia. I learned he had been highly repected educator; I can attest he retained unmistakable dignity even as simple tasks, even the ability to speak were beyond his present capability. One day he was late for lunch. The two staff who brought him in were verbally rude and while not rough, were abrupt in providing the physical guidance and support he needed. Why you causing us such trouble, can't you even get into a chair alright and so on as this man looked at the plastic utensils on the food tray that was dropped before him from a few inches above the tablewith no sign of comprehension as to what they might be or be used for. The verbal berating continued as a staff stuck a spoon in his right hand, then turned to laughter when a few kernels of corn fell out of his mouth. I was glad to leave the room and it wasn't because of institutional food quality. A few days later, I was in the hall outside his room where two staff were”assisting him in dressing, literally cursing him for his inability to do it on his own. I mean what the absolute heck? Did their foul-mouthed mockery make their task any easier? A few days before I left I was in the day room when this man came in. This was a rare event, since he was required to have continual staff escort when out of his room due to his mobility problems. I was edging out of my chair to go inform staff when the man stumbled, started to fall and I had happened into the right spot to keep the floor from meeting his face, thereby violating a primary clinic rule: no physical contact between patients.

For those with the fantasy of getting the rich and big whatever to pay for it, are you ready to dump the progressive tax system for something like the fair tax, flat tax, or value added tax.

If you master this technique you will find that you require brake only for emergency stops and you will save fuel too. Engine braking refers to the braking effect that occurs in engines when the accelerator pedal is released. This causes fuel injection to cease and the throttle valve to close almost completely, greatly restricting airflow. This causes a strong manifold vacuum for which the cylinders have to work against the forward momentum of the vehicle. This vacuum manifold effect is further amplified by a gear down shift, which induces a faster spinning drivetrain to slow down with the engine."},{"instruction":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","output":"Is that ‘conservatives’ or ‘Conservatives’? As with the ‘Left’, we tend to have a very different viewpoint to conservative to the US, where borderline fascism seems to equate to ‘conservative’ these days. I’m what a US conservative would consider a Left-Wing, Atheist, liberal - none of which bothers me in the slightest. In the UK, I’m probably seen as mildly left-wing, agnostic and open minded for an ageing white man. Gun rights? Maybe they’ve got a bit extreme - It seems a shame that people can’t enjoy shooting sports if they can demonstrate suitability to do so, but I fully understand and even support how and why we got where we are. Very, very few in the UK are interested in letting people have unfettered access to handguns and military grade weapons. Ending abortion? That’s a woman’s choice (with some input from their partner where relevant, but ultimately hers) - No-one should be forced to have a child they don’t want and no child should have to be brought into the world unwanted. Ending Gay Marriage? Marriage is a tradition under severe strain. Very many end in divorce, so if two people of the same gender want to commit themselves to each other, I’m unworried by letting them. It doesn’t affect me. How would it affect a ‘conservative’? Restoring the death penalty? While in angry moments, I can wish vile criminals dead, I also know that people are put in prison for crimes they didn’t commit and I wouldn’t support killing even one of those wrongfully accused for a ‘greater good’. It’s not as though the death penalty is any kind of disincentive to crime in the USA. I suspect my views are pretty widely held, even amongst more ‘conservative’ UK residents."},{"instruction":"Why don't elite soldiers and Navy SEALs have physiques like Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel?","output":"That's because the Rock has what is called “show” muscle meaning his physique is more for looks than practical purposes. Sure they are strong, but just being strong is practical when it comes to combat. You can be strong without being big and that's what the military shoots for. There are a couple of things you give up having all of that muscle that you need for combat, flexibility, agility and what I call stayability….the only way you can keep muscle like that is with a proper diet of many thousands of calories a day and hours of working out in a gym a day. When you are in combat you don't get a regular diet of thousands of calories and you definitely don't get gym time, so if you start out ripped on a combat mission you most likely won't end that mission ripped, especially if it's a long mission, this is because during a mission you have very limited space to put things such as food you are forced to restrict your calorieintake during missions. Then there is the size, a person the size of the Rock would be very limited by his size in the type of combat roles he can do. Big guys don't fit in small spaces, and the military goes into a lot of small spaces, and their vehicles, ships, tanks etc…have very tight quarters. Lastly, military physical training focuses more on aerobic exercises that tends to keep people small and lean, not anaerobic training which would be required to get big and bulky."},{"instruction":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","output":"It all depends on the scenario.

There are total 250 active stocks in market and 10000 Mutual Fund schemes are the combination of these 250 stocks along with bonds. Researching in Mutual Fund is toughest than individual stock. It is better to research on Mutual Fund Managers rather than on schemes. So why to go for active funds? Select Index Funds. Each and every AMC has Index Funds and the expense ratio is too low.

What is go inside?","output":"Outside and inside in an illustration: Using body-mind thinking is basically the outside of you. Ironically one has to use the body-mind thinking to get to see the inside unseen side of you and hence become and see your True Self: which is part of the Universe itself: So you can see one is just an extension of the Universe. All movement of the discovery of your True Self and looking inside is ONLY through the movement of one’s own mind from the verbal thinking mind to the silent mind and when all thoughts have ceased one is the Universe itself. What does this feel like? Calm, happy, perhaps because of a sense of discovery of the movements of the mind and its mind spaces and having control over one's mind. In this state, one feels a genuine sense of compassion for all. Discovery of this state of mind will allow you to spend more time in the silent mind with just conscious awareness and not worry too much about what you observe and having enough empathy to do what you can with what you have in life. So you can see there is this sense in you of being one with all. So looking inside is a journey of discovery of the mind. True Love and compassion: The thinking mind can never know what true love and compassion is until you get “inside” and is of the Universe itself and am love and compassion itself. It is different from becoming love and compassion by the process of thinking which is what it is like with most other things we become, which is only temporarily in existence until the conditions change and the love and compassion disappear. s"},{"instruction":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works?

Literally. Colorado was the first state to declare Columbus Day a state holiday, back in 1905. Growing up, Columbus Day was a day of ethnic pride. I never even knew it was controversial, until . . . One day I’m at work. Next to me, there’s a co-worker, a pretty American Indian* girl. We’re kind of chatting back and forth and I happen to ask, “So are you doing anything for Columbus Day?” Wham. She goes from smiling and chatty to turning her back on me. What did I say? After a while she gets over her hurt and anger and explains to me that Christopher Columbus is NOT a hero to her people, that he brought death and destruction and enslavement and she doesn’t see any reason that we should celebrate that. Oh. That sort of put a damper on my Columbus Day celebration. I had read some books when I was a teenager, like Dee Brown’s “Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee” and Vine Deloria’s “Custer Died For Your Sins.” I understood how American Indians* had been mistreated by the majority culture and was sympathetic, I had even named my first daughter “Cheyenne,” explicitly after the tribe, not the city. It never occurred to me that I had this blind spot (which, after all, is the definition of a blind spot.) A little after that encounter, Vine Deloria accepted a contract to start teaching at the University of Colorado and I enrolled in his class. Vine became my favorite professor, went on to become my friend and mentor and advisor in grad school, and through him I became this Italian-American kid hanging out with members of the American Indian Movement and the Native American Rights Fund. We started a campaign to get rid of Columbus Day, or change it to a day to honor indigenous peoples. I’m proud to say that Denver, where Columbus Day was first established, now recognizes that day as Indigenous People’s Day. I’m an Italian-American from Denver. We started the holiday. We can end it if we like. *My grandkids insist that I should be calling them “Native Americans” instead of “American Indians.” But Vine Deloria and some of the other Indian activists I knew like Russell Means, called themselves “Indians” and preferred that title. So I’m going to use it."},{"instruction":"w do I breathe during HIIT or running?","output":"You're supposed to lose all your energy very quickly. That's the whole point of intensity.

What all I am going to share is not just for a 17 year old girl but every girl irrespective of the age and maturity. Don’t compare yourself and don’t let others compare you. We have the tendency to look beautiful and compare ourselves with some celebs. I ask you why? Everyone’s life and situation is different. They are getting paid for being beautiful. If you leave your studies and the job you are doing and have lots of money, trust me you might look better than them. But you can’t! You have responsibilities to carry. Accept yourself the way you are to avoid that mental stress. Don’t feel insecure about looks. While I shared a picture of mine in an ethnic wear, I mentioned I am dusky, average looking girl and too photogenic and the picture I am sharing is filtered. A girl messaged thanking me for making me accept herself completely. So what if I am dusky? So what if I am short. Big deal? I need the world to know I am dusky and average looking. Why? Because my beauty lies in the confidence I carry, the smile I wear, the kind heart I have, the attitude of not giving up I pursue, and the aspirations I hold. It makes me beautiful. People will come and go, judge you with your clothes and look, but the one who will love you, will love you even when you lose all your teeth and your memory in old age! Remember that. Just try to change your flaws and try being nice. DON’T body-shame any girl/guy EVER! People mostly say that a girl is jealous of another girl and to some extent it’s true. Most of us try to portray a good image in front of men by portraying other girls bad and mean and by trolling their looks. This should be a big NO! Never be jealous of any girl. Also never demean any girl. There are people whom I know of have the tendency not to compliment girls. Change it! Trolling friends by addressing them with cute names as “Moti” and “Patli” is okay till it’s fun and should not be exaggerated. Don’t run behind trying to find a right guy. Take your time. Things happen automatically. No one knows the future. Be someone who understands what life is all about and certainly it’s not always about the “Guy”. Be ambitious. Be cautious. Be fierce and be simple. A girl with ambitions and trying to achieve one is the sexiest! Don’t ever get intimate with someone you don’t love/ Someone who doesn’t feel for you if you are emotional People wanted me to hook up casually after my break up. I knew it would destroy me since I am a very emotional person who believes in love. Being vulnerable makes you do stupid things which you will always regret later. Try to stay away from things that might hurt you in future. Don’t trust anyone who suddenly becomes close to you after your breakup because you never know your weakness. Don’t think it’s too late for you to pursue a different career Girls have the tendency to think that it’s time to marry else they won’t get any eligible groom after 25. They even continue with that career they are not interested because who has time to switch? Nope! Please do it. Situations might not have allowed you to pursue something you wanted but there is always a time you can go for it. Even I am doing PhD for the sake of stability. Marriage can wait, the right groom can wait but not your dreams. Don’t betray men! Or don’t let the man betray you. Falling in love is easy but maintaining that love comes from within. If someone loves you, love them back with the same passion if you are in a relationship. If you feel like the luster is lost, it’s better to let go of the relationship by mutual consent and talks. But yes, don’t dump or ditch a person without any explanation! Everyone deserves an explanation. It makes one go mad thinking about the reason of being dumped. Be true to your relationship or never be in one! Also, the day you realize you are being cheated, let go of that toxic relationship and feel happy about it.

Alexander’s army was outnumbered by the Persians under the command of their king, Darius. This was the initial deployment, with Darius in the center of the Persian line, Persian cavalry on both his flanks, and Persian chariots in front: Alexander took most of his cavalry, including his [LINKED_TEXT: Companion Cavalry] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_cavalry] , and began riding towards the right of the field, parallel to the Persian line. He took a scratch force of some infantry and interposed them between his cavalry on that side of the field and the Persian chariots, to keep those chariots from hitting his cavalry on their exposed flank as they rode off to the right hand side of the field on the map. The Persian cavalry opposite Alexander shadowed him, and also rode off in that direction, toward the right side of the map, to make sure that he didn’t outflank the Persian line. That was what Alexander wanted: he wanted to remove as much of the Persian cavalry from their initial position as possible. He also had a surprise for the Persian cavalry. While he rode off toward the right with his cavalry, Alexander had some light infantry keeping pace with him, but concealed from the Persian cavalry by the presence of Alexander’s cavalry between the Persians and that light infantry force. So now you had 3 parallel lines moving towards the right side of the map: the Persian cavalry, Alexander’s cavalry, whom the Persians could see, and Alexander’s light infantry, whom the Persians could not see and didn’t know was there. The more Alexander moved to the right, the more the Persian cavalry on that side of the field moved to the right, as they shadowed him - kind of like the spy in football who floats behind the defensive line of scrimmage to keep pace with the opposing quarterback. Eventually, the Persian cavalry outflanked what they assumed was Alexander’s attempt to outflank them. At which point, having gained the “advantage”, the Persian cavalry charged Alexander. Which is exactly what Alexander had hoped they would do: in shadowing him and keeping pace as he rolled to the right of the field, a gap had opened in the Persian line. A gap where the Persian cavalry had been at the start of the battle, and Alexander’s goal all along had been to draw the Persian cavalry out of position in order to produce that gap. That’s when Alexander’s concealed light infantry came into play: when the Persian cavalry charged, Alexander released that light infantry he’d kept concealed all that time to engage the Persian cavalry and keep them occupied. He left that light infantry, along with most of his cavalry, to keep the Persian cavalry busy, and neatly disengaged his elite Companion Cavalry from the fray. Then he rode back at the head of his Companion Cavalry, in a wedge formation, straight for the gap in the Persian line where the Persian cavalry had been at the start of the battle. A gap where the Persian king, Darius, happened to be. It was a surgical strike that won the battle. Seeing Alexander leading a furious cavalry charge straight at him, at the head of a wedge of Companion Cavalry, and not enough cavalry of his own in position to challenge Alexander, Darius panicked and fled the battlefield. Hollywood seldom captures historic battles accurately. But I think the Gaugamela battle scene in the movie Alexander did a good job in faithfully depicting this maneuver as it was described by the writers of Alexander’s era"},{"instruction":"Where has Indian media gone wrong?","output":"Today's media is politically motivated and purely commercialized.The other answer beautifully reveals the state of electronic media.

I just talked about Itachi’s scaling and best attributes in one of my latest answers, so check that out for a more detailed explanation. [LINKED_TEXT: Alan Jia's answer to How strong is Itachi in his prime?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-strong-is-Itachi-in-his-prime/answer/Alan-Jia-1] Basically, Edo Itachi~/~>Post-KF Sasuke~/~>MKCM Naruto<~Rinnegan Obito~Edo Madara in speed. This is highballing Itachi somewhat, but I explained why I don’t think the highball is too outlandish, and it’s required for this to be a match worth discussing. For Tobirama, he’s directly stated to be faster than Madara. Therefore, Edo Tobirama>Edo Madara. So he should be a bit faster than Edo Itachi based on this statement. But using feats, you can scale him even higher. When Juubito left an exploding TSO attached to Minato’s arm, Sasuke was able to react, protecting him and Naruto with the Susanoo, but Tobirama was able to do much more than react. He came from completely offscreen, blitzed over to the TSO with Shunshin, grabbed it, and teleported away before it exploded. And the exclamation mark next to Sasuke indicates he didn’t realize Tobirama’s presence until after he’d teleported. Or it could just be shock that Tobirama got rid of the TSO. Considering Minato was already going to do that though, I don’t think that makes much sense. Does this make Tobirama a perception blitz tier over Edo Itachi? Well, yes, but actually no. What I mean is that Tobirama’s mental FTG activation speed is possibly faster than Sasuke’s perception, but his physical speed isn’t. It wouldn’t make sense for Tobirama to be THAT fast, cause then he would’ve been easily blitzing around Madara when they were alive. Even with that in mind, Sasuke was only able to do a small movement from a much closer distance while Tobirama could move, grab, and teleport in a harder position to act. The feat is a tad hard to quantify, given that Shunshin amps your speed by at least a blitz tier, so it wouldn’t apply to Tobirama in normal situations, and him being able to grab it before it exploded really only directly puts him above MKCM Naruto, not EMS Sasuke or Edo Itachi. But the implication of Tobirama being the fastest in that scene is definitely there. Not to mention the fact that Tobirama was able to tag Juubito’s shoulder before he could react. Then there’s Tobirama’s other feats against Juubito and dodging Rinnegan SM Madara, which are arguably even more insane. Most of these feats do have counterarguments though. For him “blitzing” Juubito, that was an offguard Juubito, and it was SM Naruto who actually tagged Juubito, Tobirama just helped him with FTG. In addition, it’s possible that Juubito thought he could phase through the attack, since right after he got hit, he noted that he couldn’t pass through objects. Which means he actually did react, and had he known he couldn’t use Kamui, he would’ve just been able to block it. This is supported by Juubito being able to later block Tobirama even when he teleported two characters far faster than SM Naruto. Him being able to tag Juubito’s back and switch places with Minato was mostly due to the fact that Minato letting himself get hit caught Juubito offguard. It’s still not something that a slowpoke could do, but it certainly doesn’t scale him to or above Juubito. As for him dodging Rinnegan SM Madara, that’s pretty great, but it is only a mental reaction, so his movement and combat speed don’t necessarily scale to him. And we know it doesn’t, since Madara reacted to him even when offguard and Tobirama got bodied offscreen right after this (Madara may have used Limbo to assist, but that still means his Limbo was fast enough to attack Tobirama before Tobirama hit him). His most blatant and indisputable feat is him placing an FTG mark on Juubito as he passed through him. But that still only makes him low end relative to Unstable Juubito at best (and you could argue that only scales to Tobirama’s physical reaction speed, not really his combat speed, although I’m fairly neutral on the matter). I explained why him blitzing Juubito by placing several paper bombs around him is pretty iffy in another answer. [LINKED_TEXT: Alan Jia's answer to How was Tobirama able to place several explosive tags on Juubito without him even noticing but was yet intercepted by 1 ringan SM Madara?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-was-Tobirama-able-to-place-several-explosive-tags-on-Juubito-without-him-even-noticing-but-was-yet-intercepted-by-1-ringan-SM-Madara/answer/Alan-Jia-1] So with all things considered, Unstable Juubito~>Edo Tobirama>Edo Madara~eKCM2 Naruto~>MKCM Naruto<~/~EMS Sasuke<~/~Edo Itachi makes the most sense to me. There are still some arguments against Tobirama>Madara, but it is imo the most reliable method of scaling him since it’s a pretty direct statement. Edo Itachi is anywhere from MKCM Naruto level+ to low end relative to Edo Tobirama. Personally I’d say his speed is around Edo Madara level, so he should be able to at least keep up with Tobirama, seeing as how Tobirama in life wasn’t able to just blitz and annihilate Madara and Madara stated Hashirama’s the only one who could beat him. Therefore, a blitz off the bat isn’t an option. So it’s time to delve into the nuances of both characters’ strengths and abilities. Itachi For him, I recommend reading the answer I linked earlier about him where I went much more in depth. In a nutshell, he’s an incredibly intelligent, adaptable, skilled, and haxed combatant who always figures out a way to deal with situations where the are odds stacked against him. The most prominent techniques of his that could be useful in this battle are: Genjutsu - If Itachi catches Tobirama’s gaze for even an instant, the battle will likely be over right then and there. Tobirama has fought Uchiha for many years, but Itachi is one of the best genjutsu users in the entire Narutoverse. Being used to fighting against decent Uchiha genjutsu users isn’t nearly the same as fighting Itachi. Itachi is also incredibly subtle with his genjutsu, so that he could potentially put Tobirama in one where he doesn’t even realize he’s trapped so that he doesn’t try breaking it (with a finger or just opening his cloak). And this is just regular genjutsu I’m talking about, Tobirama doesn’t stand a chance in hell of getting out of Tsukuyomi. Or Kotoamatsukami, which Edo Itachi also has access to via Shisui’s crow (if you think that counts as prep time, then my response is that Tobirama can have access to Edo Tensei shinobi to make it fair). But that’s if he gets caught, which I’ll get into more in the Tobirama section.Mangekyo Sharingan - This seems kinda obvious, but having the MS against someone as quick as Tobirama to track his movements better is a big boon. This wouldn’t be helpful against FTG as that provides no movements to predict, but otherwise, Itachi should be able to react to almost anything Tobirama throws at him and even see it coming ahead of time. Susanoo - If he gets this up before Tobirama places a mark on him, he’ll basically be safe from FTG gg for the rest of the match as he has nearly unlimited stamina (I don’t think the argument for Tobirama marking the Susanoo then teleporting inside it or just yeeting the Susanoo away really works as well as it does for Minato, since we know Tobirama fought the Susanoo many times against Madara and likely Izuna, yet he wasn’t able to just make that a non factor, seeing as how right after busting out the PS, Madara said no one but Hashirama could stop him. This is either PIS or because it’s actually impossible or because Tobirama’s not skilled enough with FTG to do something like that). You can argue Tobirama might be able to destroy weaker versions of the Susanoo, but frankly speaking, Tobirama has no scaleable AP feats. There are implications for him having impressive AP (like him scaring Sasuke/Suigetsu and Rinnegan SM Madara dodging his attack), but not enough to say he could destroy an Armored Susanoo. And obviously he’s not gonna get through the Yata Mirror. He’d need to circle around it to have even a remote chance. And I’m not even sure he could do that without a ton of difficulty, seeing as how the Susanoo actually scales above the user in speed. This could also help close the gap in speed, which would be pretty bad for Tobirama since that’s kind of his thing. It would also make the Totsuka Blade a much bigger threat if it was close in speed to Tobirama.Amaterasu - Whether this could tag Tobirama is one thing, but Itachi could definitely use Amaterasu to limit Tobirama’s movements and the space in which he can teleport, which would greatly inhibit his combat ability seeing as how his main thing is speed. And an insanely OP way this could be utilized is hitting Tobirama with it while he’s not looking at Itachi’s eyes to avoid genjutsu. That way Tobirama’s only way of detecting something coming would be his sensory abilities, which he wouldn’t necessarily have activated in the middle of a battle. In that case, he’d most certainly be burned. He could potentially teleport the flames away, but he would need to place a mark somewhere else, which isn’t something he tends to do. So he would need to place a marker then warp the flames off him, which would still mean suffering intense burn wounds for a few moments. This would both weaken Tobirama and give Itachi an opportunity to attack him.Crow/Exploding Shadow Clones - You wouldn’t think such “basic” maneuvers would be effective in a fight like this, but the versatility of Itachi’s clones is often underestimated. He can set up a crow clone that intentionally gets hit so that it explodes in a flock of crows to disorient Tobirama, which would give Itachi an opportunity to catch him offguard with Amaterasu or a Totsuka Blade stab from behind. Or he can substitute a crow clone at the start of the fight so that it can test out Tobirama’s capabilities. That way, if Tobirama catches it offguard with an FTG blitz, Itachi would be able to learn from that and make sure that doesn’t happen to him. And an exploding shadow clones’ usefulness should be pretty obvious. Tobirama might be able to get away the moment before it explodes, but that’s if he detects it. That is rather likely given Kakashi did, but it’s unknown how Kakashi detected the clone, it could’ve been the Sharingan which Tobirama doesn’t have). Izanagi/Izanami - While it’s unlikely Itachi would use these abilities, if Itachi finds himself in a situation where he feels he can die, he can use Izanagi to potentially one shot Tobirama with a surprise attack similar to Obito against Konan or Pain against Jiraiya (technically they survived, but you get what I mean). Or he can trap Tobirama in a loop and kills him while he’s immobile. I’m aware Izanami works by forcing someone to change something about their mindset so it’s best against bad guys, but Itachi can make Tobirama confront some of his biases against the Uchiha, even if just for a few seconds. Tobirama To be honest, Tobirama’s attributes are pretty similar to Itachi. He’s also super intelligent, adaptable, skilled, and haxed. He was able to instinctively launch into his TPB attack plan right after getting cut in half. This led to even Minato praising Tobirama’s quick thinking. He also had the foresight to teleport a shadow clone to Juubito because he knew that it would take a while to regenerate from a TSO even as an Edo Tensei (this was before he realized TSOs null regen). He came up with a method to distract Juubito and tag him with a clever FTG trick. He was the first to realize Minato’s arm wasn’t regenerating (although this Minato was mentally nerfed, that at least shows Tobirama’s observation skills are greater than Naruto’s and Sasuke’s), and from that, realized the composition of the TSOs. He then realized that Gamakichi’s attack wasn’t instantly nullified, and figured out that senjutsu was effective against Juubito. He immediately understood the meaning of the flares behind Juubito’s back. Without any words exchanged, he figured out how Minato teleported the alliance outside the Six Crimson Rays Formation. He deduced that he could use the mark he placed on Minato to connect to his chakra which connected to Naruto’s chakra which was connected to the members of the ninja alliance in order to protect them with FTG. Finally, he attacked Madara right when he was least focused which nearly worked, and Madara confirmed it as a tried and true strategy of his. Which is in line with the databook statement of him always acting in accordance to the situation of the battle. In addition to his quick wits and skill in battle, his constant composure even in the toughest of situations is excellent, just like Itachi’s. While this isn’t specifically battle related, in the same databook entry, he was also stated to never be controlled by emotion, which adds to the idea of his stone cold composure. Tobirama also has the edge in experience. What I mean isn’t specifically that Tobirama’s lived longer than Itachi (although that is a factor), but more that the kind of experience Tobirama’s had prepared him for this battle better than Itachi’s, seeing as how he fought members of the Uchiha Clan for decades. Because of this, he should know not to look Itachi in the eye when fighting him. This wouldn’t help him avoid getting caught in a genjutsu like Ephemeral, but he can at least avoid the more potent ones like Tsukuyomi and Kotoamatsukami with it. And I believe despite what I said earlier that Tobirama likely would detect if he’s in a genjutsu. If not at first, then before it’s too late. Both due to this experience and his sensory abilities which I’ll talk about later. As for his techniques that would be useful against Itachi: Flying Thunder God - While not as proficient in the use of this jutsu as Minato, Tobirama is still amazing with FTG. The fact that he was able to use it to great effect against the likes of JUUBITO means it’ll absolutely be pivotal in this battle. He has so many creative ways to use FTG in combat that he’s shown. Even the basic act of teleporting to an opponent and catching them offguard with a quick attack has been shown to let you blitz opponents that you were otherwise relative to (the examples with Minato are a bit iffy for reasons too complicated to be worth explaining, but they still somewhat work). Water Style - While this certainly wouldn’t end the battle or anything, Tobirama’s potent Water Style is a pretty hard counter to Itachi who specializes in Fire Style ninjutsu. Sensory abilities - Simply put, Tobirama is up there with the best sensors in the series. He could detect the exact number of enemies surrounding him after mere moments. He’s a better sensor than Hashirama, at least in base. He was able to sense Madara from hundreds of miles away. He could feel the potency of Juubito’s chakra. He was able to sense Naruto’s exact location even while using ninjutsu. And the databook noted him to be especially blessed with excellent sensory abilities. Tandem Paper Bombs - Tobirama’s Edos wouldn’t be particularly useful for the most part against someone like Itachi, seeing as how his Edo Tensei is apparently even worse than Orochimaru’s, whose Edos are barely Sannin level. But for the use of TPB, they would be extremely useful. If Tobirama can manage to restrain Itachi after he attacks one of his Edos, which splashes paper bombs onto him, then Itachi will almost certainly be dead. Susanoo won’t protect him from bombs already on his body. Sure, they’d prevent Tobirama from placing more to start the main explosion after the initial attack, but honestly, TPB should be enough to actually break through the Susanoo, other than the Yata Mirror. I say this because it destroyed the Gracious Deity Gates ([LINKED_TEXT: Alan Jia's answer to How would you rank each generation of the 5 kage from strongest to weakest (as a whole not individually)?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-rank-each-generation-of-the-5-kage-from-strongest-to-weakest-as-a-whole-not-individually/answer/Alan-Jia-1]). Yeah, Hashirama wasn’t infusing nature energy into them like he was earlier given that he stopped holding the hand sign for it. But that still means they should at least have the durability of Base Hashirama’s constructs, which could withstand a Nine Tails Bijuudama. I doubt I need to explain why that’s stronger than what Itachi’s Susanoo can withstand, but if I do, refer to Madara saying his Perfect Susanoo is Nine Tails level, which would imply weaker versions are not. And this is from Madara, whose physical strength is far greater than Itachi’s. And Tobirama might not even need the full attack. It’s possible the first several bombs that land on Itachi could critically injure him, if not kill him, considering they even knocked Juubito around. Shadow Clone Jutsu - While this isn’t a technique Tobirama employs much, it can be used to deadly effect in combination with FTG. Like the swap attack that he performed with Minato. Or just to disorient Itachi. Imagine half a dozen Tobiramas running and teleporting back and forth all around Itachi, just waiting for when he let his guard slip.Four Crimson Rays Formation - I know this isn’t a jutsu that can be performed with one person, but just refer to the above mentioned ability. Tobirama could theoretically use 3 shadow clones to form a weaker version of the barrier used to seal away the Juubi. How would this be useful you ask? Well, it would help contain the explosion of the TPB, so that Itachi can’t escape it and it’ll be more compressed in a smaller space. That would be guaranteed to turn the inside of the barrier into a pool of Uchiha blood. The Fight Now that I’ve thoroughly broken down both fighters, it’s time I answer the question: Who would win? But frankly speaking, after really thinking about it, I don’t know. They both have several ways to one shot their opponent, their skill and intelligence are comparable, their combat speeds aren’t far apart, they both have techniques to significantly increase their damage output and speed, etc. Frankly, they’re perfectly matched. They both counter the other in different ways. The Susanoo counters Tobirama’s speed and his battle style of taking the opponents’ rear. Tandem Paper Bombs counter the Susanoo. Izanagi counters TPB. Tobirama’s experience counters Itachi’s specialization in genjutsu. Itachi’s superior skill in genjutsu to other Uchiha counters Tobirama’s experience. Izanami counters the difficulty it takes for Tobirama to be hit via not requiring a direct strike on the opponent. Tobirama’s unpredictable fighting style counters the necessity to create a repeat of a set of events. Tobirama’s Water Style counters Itachi’s Fire Style. Amaterasu counters any elemental ninjutsu. FTG counters Amaterasu. I could go on and on for hours. They have hundreds of ways to counter each other. The battle would either last for a long time or end almost instantly if one of their attacks can finish off their opponent before they figure them out. But there has to be someone who has at least a slightly greater chance right? Well, yes. Even though it’s just about dead even, I do believe that Itachi has a slightly greater chance of victory. This probably sounds funny when Itachi’s opponent is a top tier speedster like Tobirama, but a few of Itachi’s wincons are faster than Tobirama’s. Genjutsu requires only a small motion or exchange of glances. While Tobirama could sense if he’s in a genjutsu, he’d need to activate sensory mode and then break out of it after, which could give Itachi enough time to kill Tobirama. Itachi has the knowledge advantage, as he lived after Tobirama and has read about him in school, so he would know the basics about him, like Tobirama having fought against the Uchiha Clan and could act accordingly on that info. And if he uses Izanagi after being killed once, his sneak attack after that could end the battle right then and there. Yeah, Tobirama has FTG gg, but that requires the act of looking in your opponent’s direction (which allows for the possibility of genjutsu gg since Tobirama wouldn’t know he’s fighting an Uchiha until he sees the Sharingan) and throwing a kunai. Itachi might even know Tobirama has FTG, although I won’t speak on whether I think that’s true or not. Just a possibility that makes Tobirama’s chances slightly lower. TPB is a great wincon, but it takes longer to set up than most of Itachi’s (except Izanami). And as I described above, Itachi has an easier method of doing chip damage to Tobirama than the other way around via using Amaterasu when Tobirama’s not looking at his eyes. Kotoamatsukami is also really hard to avoid. Not only will Tobirama have to worry about not looking at Itachi’s eyes, but he also has to make sure he doesn’t look into the eye of the crow flying around. He could try attacking it with a kunai, but if he’s not careful enough, he could accidently cross gazes with it and then he’d be caught. If you think Tobirama wins more times than not because of the speed advantage on top of FTG and being more seasoned, I honestly don’t blame you. Any of his higher end feats can be used to argue why he bodies Itachi. But Itachi’s argument is just a tad more solid if you ask me.

Salary is great (Poland still pays very similar to UK salaries for senior international personnell, something most Polish seniors in banks are dreaming about). Quality of life is great. All jokes aside, Poland is a country full of opposites. The main hubs are expanding, it is an interesting country to live in, but if you seek a future, perhaps not. If however, you are from a country, such as Belarus, or for example Croatia, getting a good job in a bank in Warsaw is a good stepping stone before you move to Berlin, Paris or London. Your boss is very likely going to be a senior guy in one of those cities. He probably won't be very good, else he wouldn't be given the task to set up and monitor the team in Poland (which most likely are going to be back-office jobs).

But it wasn’t always like this for me. Just like you have seen above, I have been through a lot of struggles, and this business model I want to introduce to you changed my life. So if you’re in the same position presently or you are just looking for something to do online that will make you a lot of money in the shortest time possible. This business model is for you. What’s this business model? This business model is called affiliate marketing. I know you have heard about it. Maybe you were even part of the people who called it a scam and won’t ever be an affiliate marketer. It’s fine and I understand. But here’s something you’re missing out. Affiliate marketing is not a bring one person before you earn kinda thing. Nah Nah. A lot of folks that are spoiling the industry portray it as that but that’s not what it is. But here’s what affiliate marketing is: Have you ever tried a product and it worked so well that you want to tell the world about it? Maybe you visited a restaurant and the food there is so nice that you can’t wait to tell your friends and families how good the food is and they should try it. Exactly. You will then go on to tell your friends and families about the product. You even tell them to buy and keep it because that product is that good. And what if I tell you that what you just did is affiliate marketing, will you believe me? That’s affiliate marketing and what we also do. The only difference is that you’re not paid for the people you referred to the product but you will be paid for doing the same thing in affiliate marketing. Still with me yeah? Good. And here’s also where we took it up the notch. Instead of telling only our family and friends, we go ahead and tell outsiders and strangers about the beauty of this product. We tell them to get it for themselves, which will benefit them. Why? Because we’re paid for it. And in summary, affiliate marketing is: We find a beneficial product (keyword is beneficial) We find out that a lot of people have used it and it’s beneficial. Then we recommend it to people to benefit from the product. If they buy, then we get paid something called commission. You understand that yeah? Good. Why a beneficial product? You see, you should never recommend a product that’s not beneficial to people because people only buy what they want. And what they want is something that must be beneficial to them. Do you get that part too? Now, as simple as this sounds… It’s not that simple.

Here are some examples in the last couple of years going there a dozen times from California: With my basket at a Safeway, I followed several people through the interior automatic entrance door. The last lady in the group stopped and held the door until I was all the way through - even though the machine was holding it open the whole time. Compulsive courtesy. I was recently in Calgary visiting friends. We went to a Walmart Super Centre. There was an associate directing shoppers to the shortest lines. In a brief conversation I asked her if they charge for bags like they do in California (I did have a bag I could’ve brought but not with me). So the shopper line guide immediately found me the shortest line and then ran up to the checker and told her not to charge me for a bag. At the same Walmart a later, I went to get a shopping cart, but they have a chain thing that requires a refundable loonie coin (1) in the slot. I was just using CC’s and never converted my US cash. A nearby greeter associate saw my plight and just gave me a cart to use without the coin. I walk a lot. Was walking up a sidewalk in SW Calgary, and a woman pushing a baby carriage was coming the other way. I continued on the far edge of the sidewalk to give her room. Just as we met, she apologized profusely for forcing me nearly off the sidewalk. Not quite knowing quite what to say, I smiled and said some variation of “no problem at all.” Later on I was in a Sobey’s headed for the exit when a lady next to me spotted a loonie on the floor. So she asked me and then compulsively everyone else nearby if anyone had dropped the coin. Finally she gave it to the checker in case someone had discovered they’d lost the coin. The checker suggested she just keep it, but she wouldn’t do that. So I imagine the checker ultimately just kept it herself. At least where I was, if you get to a corner on foot and look like you want to cross, all the cars stop then and there for you. So I got in a habit of standing well back from the street if I weren’t immediately intending to cross. I went with my friends to Radium Hot Springs BC for a soak in the huge naturally heated pool. I qualify for the senior citizen 0.90 discount and asked for that. However, the clerk rang me up for full price. I asked about it, but finally it was my mistake for approving the excessive charge on the CC terminal. A dumb thing and no big deal so I started to walk on. However, with a line forming, the clerk was extremely apologetic and said she felt really bad. The lockers require a loonie so she handed me one to have for that. It was embarrassing because I wasn’t paying attention and could’ve canceled the payment for a 0.90 do-over or simply ignore the whole little thing. Couple days later I went ice skating on a neighborhood “Adopt-A-Rink.” I was the only one on the ice when two ladies, one with a small girl, came up to check it out. The mother then asked me if it was OK if she came on the rink and let her daughter use the ice walker that was there. I told her, “Of course, the more, the merrier.” Very rusty on ice skates (no convenient ice in California), I told the ladies I “used to be good at this.” They replied that I was “skating awesome.” But heck, they didn’t need to ask my permission to bring the child on the rink. Incredible. July 2019 update: I went out near midnight on a warm evening to get some air. Just as I passed a house where people were leaving, the homeowner’s dog ran out in the street from the open door and was barking at me. No threat, just noise. The homeowner ran out and must’ve yelled “Sorry” a dozen times before I could yell back, “It’s OK, no prob!” and he relaxed. Courtesy is contagious, so this is all a great thing.

Unfortunately, the prosthetics are designed to respond only to the chakra of the person they’re made for. Kawaki was going to remain armless for the time being, but Naruto, who has pretty amazing chakra control, manages to split his chakra to power the arm from a distance. It works like a shadow clone.

Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?","output":"It still baffles me that people are bending over backwards to try and come up with some explanation for the shield breaking. It’s Vibranium. It’s not indestructible. This theory also just doesn’t track when you see everything the shield went through in that movie. It clashed with another Vibranium shield, it took serious beatings before it was cut, Thanos got hit pretty hard by it, it was smacked around by Mjolnir. Why is it hard for people to just think how a sword forged somewhere and somehow in space could slice through a metal that’s not impenetrable. Yes, Vibranium is stronger than steel, yes it absorbs vibrations which makes it nearly indestructible (through a unique property, not the quality of the metal itself). However, there’s still a limit as to how much that property can withstand. Thanos (a very large person) was hammering down on the shield. That plus the likelihood that his sword is made of some special metal as well makes it believable enough that the shield could have been broken. And once he made that first cut, the structure was weakened, meaning it was easier to hack away at it (and that still took effort)."},{"instruction":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","output":"I would make a better president than Donald Trump."},{"instruction":"What are the worst things about corporate culture?","output":"Self-importance, funny though they all end up with a lesser job when they get older!

It took me two months before the teacher finally agreed to let me volunteer, but my contact with the students was minimal, I was basically used as her gofer, not as an extra adult to help the kids. I volunteered in his kindergarten class 2–4 days each week and the teacher loved having me there, so this was odd. When I finally did get a look in the class I realized why he was struggling so much. She was awful! She obviously hated teaching, especially little boys for some strange reason I never understood. Every recess I was there at minimum 2–3 little boys would have to sit in. After some intense research I made the decision to homeschool because of the stress on my son. His kindergarten teacher and school social worker supported me 100% and it was the best decision I've ever made. It only lasted 3 years, but they were amazing!

That needs a line of its very own. Jazz is an identity marker. An expression of people. Community validates. People create and community validates. We always need to understand the context of the art form coming out of the culture to understand its authenticity. Jazz is a soundtrack of the cultural independence of the United States from Europe. Jazz is art. Art can be defined through the Greek root: artis, meaning excellence. Jazz is considered art. Art requires mastery. A child who plays the flute for the first time does not make art because it requires mastery of the skill. All the same, Jazz is not something one can just “pick up.” It is historic and aesthetically pleasing. Art stands the test of time; art in the future will still be great “timeless.” Everything musical comes from intuition, and by extension through inheritance. Africans in North America who were deprived of instruments by their slave owners were able to use intuition to recreate the rhythms for music consciously and subconsciously. It is so deeply ingrained in the African culture that some regard individuals as ‘born musicians.’ This intuition was expressed by syncopation which is how jazz was created. Intuition isn’t exclusive to music though, the syncopation (modifying rhythm by stressing or accenting a beat) can be seen in other aspects of African culture through, dance, art, architecture; the patterns seen are syncopated with choice of color and patterns. It’s different from knowledge that can be passed from generation to generation instead it is ingrained in the culture as intuition. A notion that in our system that ourselves Cary information. We have 2 brains; the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system. Our cells carry information that’s been passed on for 100s of millions of years. Bergson explains it as a gut feeling which is difficult to describe. Instinct. The element that is nonlogical, a subconscious understanding of our environment. It is a flow that moves and mixes both of our sympathetic systems through us to the tips of our fingers to express creativity. It exists in everyone one of us from our head and our gut to the tips of our fingers. It is important in jazz as it requires improvisation on the spot. Bergson is the first to attempt a logical explanation of intuition."},{"instruction":"your opinion, among these 3 women, who is the best Wonder Woman? Lynda Carter, Susan Eisenberg, or Gal Gadot? I'm just asking, that's all and thank you 🙂😊?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Wonder Woman (1974 film) - WikipediaWonder Woman is a 1974 American made-for-television superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name , directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Cathy Lee Crosby . The film was a pilot for an intended television series being considered by ABC . The film presented the character as a James Bond –style superspy, and did not contain many elements from the comic book series. [1] Ratings were described as \\"respectable but not exactly wondrous\\" and ABC did not pick up the pilot. [2] Instead, Warner Brothers and ABC developed a different Wonder Woman television concept that fit the more traditional presentation of the character as created by William Moulton Marston , turning away from the 1968–1972 era that had influenced the pilot. The New Original Wonder Woman , which premiered in 1975, starred Lynda Carter and eventually led to the Wonder Woman TV series . Crosby would later claim that she was offered the chance to reprise the role in that series. [3] Background Edit Cathy Lee Crosby in the first Wonder Woman film. Wonder Woman's first broadcast appearance in live-action television was a movie made in 1974 for ABC. Written by John D. F. Black , the TV movie resembles the Wonder Woman of the \\" I Ching \\" period. Wonder Woman ( Cathy Lee Crosby ) did not wear the comic-book uniform, demonstrated no apparent super-human powers, had a \\"secret identity\\" of Diana Prince that was not all that secret, and she was also depicted as blonde (differing from the black hair established in the comic books). The pilot aired originally on March 12, 1974. [4] and was repeated on August 21 of that year. [5] Ratings were described as \\"respectable but not exactly wondrous\\". [2] ABC did not pick up the pilot, although Crosby would later claim she was offered the series that was eventually given to Lynda Carter. [3] An ABC spokesperson would later acknowledge that the decision to update the character was a mistake. [2] However, DC Comics did make this version canonical in the limited run Infinite Crisis as Wonder Woman of Earth-462. Warner Brothers released this pilot into syndication as a stand-alone 90-minute telefilm, where it played on independent TV stations throughout the 1970s and 1980s. On December 11, 2012, Warner Brothers made the Cathy Lee Crosby pilot available as a Video On Demand purchase through their online store. This film follows Wonder Woman, assistant to government agent Steve Trevor (Kaz Garas), as she pursues a villain named Abner Smith ( Ricardo Montalbán ), who has stolen a set of code books containing classified information about U.S. government field agents. Along the way, she has to outwit Smith's chief assistants: the handsome yet dangerous George (Andrew Prine) and a rogue Amazon, Ahnjayla (Anitra Ford), whom Smith has taken on as a bodyguard; a brief duel between Wonder Woman and Ahnjayla is the film's only significant action sequence, which occurs during the final third of the story.

The newborn photography session is an important part of the preparation of your little one’s arrival. You’ll have only a few months of time for those precious moments to be captured. In fact, you’ll be amazed and exclaimed that they change and grow quickly. Now that you have decided on the newborn photography session, the next thing is the style. Yes, what newborn photography style would you like to do? Let’s start with the two most popular styles of newborn photography:- Posed & Styled Newborn Photography This type of newborn photography style involves posing your newborn with cute props and calm backdrops. These are the pictures that you usually see on social media – a picture of a baby sleeping in the basket or something else with backdrops and props. Some parents might be very creative, and they would like to have pictures of their little in different poses. If you are aiming for posed and styled newborn photography style, then it is recommended to schedule the session about a week or two after birth as the newborn can be moved around easier in this stage. It can be difficult after this stage because you can expect less sleep and more movement during the session. It is essential to check the newborn photographer’s portfolio or gallery to see whether you like their posed styles or not. In most of the sessions, wraps are used in baby photo shoots. At the same time, some tend to wrap the babies from neck down to toes, while others love to expose little arms, legs, and bellies. Also, check for the props that are used in the photographer’s portfolio. Do you like the babies posed on the piano or some other props? Or would you like to see your little one in baskets? You can also have some family portraits during the photo session. Candid & Lifestyle Newborn Photography Candid is something completely different from the posed style. Instead of posing the babies, the pictures are captured as-they-happen without any setup or direction from the photographers. This style captures those sweet moments that happen between you and your baby that you will cherish. Moreover, family photos also work well in this style, especially when there are siblings involved. Siblings would love to spend time with their brother or sister, and it is essential to document the love they share with each other. The session will be completely relied on natural light in a lifestyle shoot. However, occasionally the session will be supported by portable lighting equipment. Things you need to consider, is there much natural light in the room? Is there enough space for the photographer? Can the room be decluttered? In general, a lifestyle photo shoot consumes less time than the posed ones. No matter the style you choose, check the portfolio of the best baby photographer and see whether you like their styles before you hire them.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"Try to find shelters in your area who do low cost check ups to see if anything is wrong with the cat. There is no reason to put a healthy cat to sleep so finding out if something is wrong with them is of the essence. If the kitty is sick, you can try to ask the vet if they know the cost treatments that might suit your parent's budget. There are circumstances in which a cat might be too sick for treatment (like end stage kidney failure) but all those things can only be determined by a proper medical exam. You posted that you are a teen, perhaps you can talk to your parents and ask them if they want to put the cat down if its healthy and if so why? If they simply cannot afford to keep the cat, try to find a foster organization or shelter. Many people look for wonderful pets to home daily. If money is an issue perhaps letting your cat go to a foster home or shelter might give them a better chance to be healthy and happy. When we are teenagers a lot of things are out of our control, however- what you could control, is to make sure that your cat has the best possible option where they are happy and cared for. One of the things with becoming an adult is facing responsability and making choices, in this case you have the choice to speak up for them since they cannot speak for themselves. Another word to you, if you cannot keep this oet for financial reasons please do not adopt until you are an adult and can take care of a pet's bills just so this doesn't have to affect both your cat and you again."},{"instruction":"Why do dogs pant and hang their tongues out such a lot when wolves (and most animals) do not?

They may also be more susceptible to predators and diseases in the wild. Furthermore, pet rats are not native to most areas and can become an invasive species if released into the wild. Invasive species can cause harm to the local ecosystem by competing with native species for resources, disrupting food webs, and spreading diseases. If you are no longer able to care for your pet rat, it is important to find a responsible and knowledgeable individual or organization to take over its care. You can try contacting local animal shelters, rescue organizations, or breed-specific clubs to find a suitable home for your pet rat."},{"instruction":"w do I translate Hindi sentences in Sanskrit?","output":"Bhagwaan ji mujhe duniya ka sabse achha insaan bnna h"},{"instruction":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

Unlike SIM cards that can be swapped or cloned, eSIMs provide better security measures by being built into the device electronics, while deploying a whole host of security features and certificates. Another advantage is that eSIMs are much harder to damage and lose. This is because eSIMs are embedded deep into a phone, while SIM cards can easily get tossed around and damaged. You cannot technically lose an eSIM chip because it is not something you take out, but you can disable it or delete an eSIM profile using your device settings. The only way you are going to lose it is if you lose your phone. Now, if you think you will be stuck with one mobile service provider, think again. eSIM feature enables you to store multiple cellular plans and profiles i.e. eSIMs. As a result, you will not have to keep swapping SIM cards when traveling around the world. Finally, as hardware element, SIM cards have to be physically delivered to the end user either by mail or through a shop, which is very inconvenient and cumbersome. On the other hand, eSIM plans are delivered digitally (e.g. using QR codes or activation codes) and accordingly mobile users can immediately get them online in few clicks."},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"Now before I get to Aamir’s numbers, let’s take a look at his rival Salman Khan.

Here is why! I am 3 times Lung + Brain Cancer survivor. You see the chances of my survival are nil because it is stage 4, but I am still here, healthy and happy. I am gonna stay here for long (Don’t ask me how, I know this). And I give all the credit to my efforts, doctor's efforts, AND the universe for I am still here. Almost 3 years ago, when I dived deeper into the world of Cancer, I could find many stories of incredible and miraculous survival where people survived against all odds. (Read ‘Radical Remission’ by Kelly Turner if you are interested.) I was skeptical when I read the book initially, as, how could eating clean help heal Cancer.. how could exercise and meditation help? But I saw that as a truth in my case. In the past 3 and a half years, the disease hit me four times, but there are many miracles that have happened during my treatment for which doctors did not have an answer. (I do plan to share those stories someday. Right now, there is a new miracle awaiting, keeping fingers crossed). ‘’You never know how a body reacts, Ankita.’ I still remember the initial diagnosis time when they say that I would be here for maybe one more year or two. But I am here! Pic Source: Google What I am trying to say is that ‘Not every Cancer has to be a death sentence’. Even if it’s in the terminal stage as mine. However, it’s portrayed very differently in books, movies, and serials. Everyone who suffers from this disease dies eventually. It sparks pity, pity for the patient, for the family. But I don’t want that. No one does. I would like the world to see the efforts I put every day, the disciplined life I live, and the miracles I have witnessed during my treatment. I would like the world to know me and every cancer-thriver as a courageous person, a person full of faith and hope, who makes a plan for the next 20 years even if doctors say otherwise. I would like the world to know that ‘Not every Cancer patient dies. And unfortunately, even if it happens, the strength needs to be celebrated’. ‘Not every Cancer is a death sentence. For sure it’s scary, but it’s scarier to live in the world full of hopelessness, and mistrust.’ Tagging the thrivers [LINKED_TEXT: Prapti Gupta] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Prapti-Gupta-15] , [LINKED_TEXT: Rohit Khanna] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Rohit-Khanna-144] , [LINKED_TEXT: Alexander Porter] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Alexander-Porter-21] .

Bosses know, and those that like it are bad bosses. In the same respect don't dress with a skirt like a belt, or a shirt like cling film. You should be judged on actions not looks. 18.

Ideas are plentiful, execution is scarce and results are gold dust. If you can have an idea and execute with great results you will earn more and get better opportunities. 21.

The society suffered from the deception of all Buddhist and nonBuddhist temples, which sided with the military authorites and supported the war, except for one Buddhist movement of ordinary people: Soka Gakkai. The Soka movement emerged before the war within educators who practiced Nichiren (1222–1282) Buddhism. But, while the priesthood supported the military government, Soka refused cooperation with the military authorities, and for this reason their publication was forced to stop and the whole organisation was banned, leaders taken to prison on refusing to the doctrine of Emperor worship. After the war ended, the Soka movement was revived by the surviving leader, Mr. Toda. But the same tradition of Nichiren Buddhism was continued - and still is practiced without any change. So, it is not a “new Buddhism”. However, Soka tradition is modern, practical and free from priesthood domination. It is superstitions and restrictions-free, does not have within its membership anyone of a special “spiritual position”. Members equally work to develop themselves and help others do the same. Soka adds to studying Buddhism the application of art, music, dance and various cultural activities - as part of Buddhism. This of course is very different from other Buddhist conservative traditions or those restricted by priests. It is a new practical approach to Buddhism, but its philosophy is exactly the same tradition established by nichiren 800 years ago. It is the biggest Buddhist organisation of ordinary people with members of all races and ethnicities. [LINKED_TEXT: History of SGI - Soka Gakkai International - Las Vegas - USAThe Soka Gakkai (literally, “Society for the Creation of Value”) was founded in 1930 by educator and author Tsunesaburo Makiguchi as a group of reformist educators. Makiguchi drew inspiration from Nichiren Buddhism to develop the organization into a broader-based movement focused on the propagation of Buddhism as a means to enable people to tap their inner potential and ultimately reform Japanese society. Facing oppression from the Japanese militarist government, Makiguchi and his closest follower Josei Toda were arrested and imprisoned in 1943 as “thought criminals”; Makiguchi died in prison in 1944. After his release, Toda promoted an active, socially engaged form of Buddhism as a means of self-empowerment–a way to overcome obstacles in life and tap inner hope, confidence, courage and wisdom. He used the term “Human Revolution” to express the central idea of Nichiren Buddhism, that all people are capable of attaining enlightenment in this lifetime. Toda was succeeded as president in 1960 by Daisaku Ikeda, who further developed the Soka Gakkai as a movement of empowered, socially engaged Buddhists. Soka Gakkai International (SGI) was founded on January 26, 1975, as a worldwide network of Buddhists dedicated to a common vision of a better world through the empowerment of the individual and the promotion of peace, culture and education. Under Ikeda’s leadership, the SGI has developed into one of the largest Buddhist movements in the world, fostering and promoting grassroots activities in areas such as nuclear abolition, human rights and education for sustainable living.”The Soka Gakkai International is a non-governmental organization (NGO) with official ties to the United Nations. It currently consists of 90 independent affiliated SGI organizations and has 12 million members in 192 countries and territories worldwide. Introducing SGI Beyond Japanese Borders International expansion of the Soka Gakkai began after World War II, when some Soka Gakkai members married mostly American servicemen and moved away from Japan. Expansion efforts gained a further boost in 1960 when Daisaku Ikeda succeeded Josei Toda as Soka Gakkai president. In his first year as president of the Soka Gakkai, Ikeda visited the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The Soka Gakkai’s American headquarters officially opened in Los Angeles in 1963. The Soka Gakkai International was formed at a meeting in Guam on January 26, 1975. Representatives from 51 countries attended the meeting and chose Ikeda as the SGI’s founding president. The SGI was created in part as a new peace movement, and its founding meeting was held in Guam in a symbolic gesture referencing Guam’s history as the site of some of World War II’s bloodiest battles, and proximity to Tinian Island, launching place of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

A description so detached from reality, that scientists are still working on a parallel universe modelling theory needed to accommodate her surreal drivel. Let’s look at the evidence. Boris Johnson resigned as prime minister when his government collapsed - with over 30 ministerial resignations in a single day. Mr Johnson then resigned as an MP just days before a democratic vote in the House of Commons found him in contempt of parliament, when he was prime minister. Ms Braverman appears to have a skill. She often talks on behalf the British people, saying the system is rigged against the British people and that the British people have had enough. Allow me to also take the liberty of talking on behalf of the British people, as Ms Braverman does. The British people want better access to NHS dentistry. The British people are fed up with complex rail fares and train cancellations. The mortgage system is rigged against the British people. The British people don’t like debt ridden, financially greedy privatised water companies discharging untreated sewages into bathing waters, used by the British people."},{"instruction":"Which movie is better, Toy Story 3 or Coco?","output":"Which is better, ice cream or hamburgers? Which is better, dogs or giraffes? Do you get the point? These two movies are in different genres (animation is not a genre, it’s a medium), for different purposes, telling different kinds of stories. Comparing them is like judging a fish on its ability to climb a tree. Toy Story 3 is about growing up and leaving childhood behind, and Coco is about discovering one’s roots and passions and remembering the past and family. So what in particular is it that you want to judge them on? Comedy? Music? Ability to make you cry? Artistic design? Because depending on what part of the movie you’re judging, one or the other could come out on top in any category. There is no point in rating them against each other. It’s okay to like both. Or either. Or neither. Or to like them for different reasons. Not everything has to be a contest."},{"instruction":"When Levene's test is significant in the independent sample ttest, should I straight away proceed to a nonparametric counterpart or report the inequality of variance assumed?","output":"Levene’s test is useless or even misleading as a gatekeeper for using an independent t-test. The null hypothesis of Levene’s test is that the variances of the two populations to be compared are equal. If the samples are very large, Levene’s test is very sensitive and will detect even small differences in populations variances that have little effect on the t-test. The t-test is not very much affected by unequal variances when samples are large or equal. Small differences in variances are more important with small samples, just where Levene’s test is less sensitive. Thus, Levene’s test may fail to attain statistical significance when samples are small, even though variances may differ enough to bias the t-test substantially. Important fact: Violation of the assumption of equal population variances causes substantial bias in the t-test only when you have a “triple-whammy”: greatly unequal sample sizes (say 4:1 or more), greatly unequal sample variances (say 4:1 or more), and the smaller sample quite small (say less than 20). The test is too liberal (gives false significance, Type I error inflated) if the smaller sample has the larger variance. This is because the standard t-test pools variance estimates from the two samples under the assumption of equal population variances, but if the smaller sample is paired with the larger variance, the actual instability of that sample mean is greater than expected using the pooled variance estimate. On the other hand, if the larger sample is the one with the larger variance, then the t-test is too conservative. Nonparametric tests have slightly less statistical power than the parametric t-test when assumptions of the parametric test are met (and the null hypotheses are different as well). Resampling is another approach that does not require assumptions of equal variance or even normality. Variances are typically reported in scientific papers, whether or not statistical significance is attained."},{"instruction":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","output":"Just let go of the accelerator and keep downshifting till you reach a very low speed and then pull up the handbrake.

However, throughout history, efforts have been made to find execution methods that are perceived as more humane than others, with the intention of reducing suffering during the process. One example often cited as a relatively humane method is execution by lethal injection. Lethal injection involves administering a lethal dose of drugs, typically a combination of an anesthetic, a paralytic agent, and a drug to stop the heart. The aim is to induce a painless death. However, it's important to note that lethal injection has faced criticism and legal challenges in various jurisdictions due to concerns about its reliability, potential pain or suffering, and the qualifications of those administering the drugs. It's also worth mentioning that different cultures and historical periods have employed various methods of execution, some of which were considered more humane in their time. For example, during the reign of the guillotine in France (late 18th to mid-19th century), the swift and mechanical nature of the device was seen as a more humane alternative to other methods prevalent at the time. Ultimately, discussions around humane execution methods raise ethical and moral questions, and opinions on the matter can vary widely.

When you first feel hungry in the day is when it feels the most acute but if you keep busy somehow, distracted, it will pass. It comes in waves. I choose to experience my hunger during the day, so that when I first wake up it takes hours now for the hunger to even start, then I just get busy when it hits me. When I start feeling sick or faint with it, or I just can’t distract myself anymore, I will first fill the gap with water. When that stops working I grab something either cheap and filling like a slice of plain bread or a small amount of something high in protein, like nuts. I’m sure there are better/other options but that’s what I can afford most often where I am. In general you want more proteins, complex carbs, and fats/ less sugars and refined carbs (which will turn into sugars). Whole foods you prep yourself are therefor better because you don’t add all the sugar and salt they put into things you buy premade - they’re also dirt cheap compared to the premade and you can even grow some yourself. Sugar and caffeine are the enemy - dissolvable B12 will give you that energy kick you need without the crash later and it’s good for your immune system too. Oatmeal is really good as a cheap source of protein but I eat it more in the afternoon and minimize added sugars or else it ends up making me hungry again faster and I feel hungrier than I feel when I don’t eat anything. I have a modest meal sometime between 5pm and 7pm of whatever I have on hand and then go to sleep before the hunger hits again. The PITA for me is waking up to pee in the night and getting hungry. I know I shouldn’t snack at night, your body doesn't like processing food when you’re sleeping as it interferes with other processes that need to happen then, so less is more at this time in your day. A small portion of yogurt or 2 crackers, no more than a few mouthfuls of whatever you choose - this one doesn’t have to be so strategic because your brain is going to think more food is coming and shut down your hungry signal and it won’t realize it’s been had before you get back to sleep (if you’re able to get back to sleep soon enough, apologies fellow insomniacs).

Here’s how I got my numbers: First calculate the reactions at the support as I’ve shown on the diagram. Between A and B: The 25 kN load “pushes” the shear diagram down by 25. There is no load (or “w”) between A and B so the slope of the V-curve =0 between A and B. i.e. no change in V. No M at the end of the beam so begin drawing M diagram at zero. Between A and B, slope of M=V, so slope=-25 i.e. a straight line. Between B and C: The load is zero at B and increases linearly to 30 at C. Since the slope of V = -w, slope of V is zero at B and slope increases to -30 at C forming a parabolic curve. Since the slope of M = V, slope of M is -25 at B and slope increases to -70 at C forming a cubic curve. Note that the change in shear between B and C = area under the load curve (I called A1). So -25 - 45 = -70 kN. Note that the 70 kN reaction force at the support will return the shear force diagram from -70 kN back to zero. Between C and D: No loading, so the shear diagram doesn’t change. i.e. a horizontal line still at -70. Since the slope of V = -w, slope of M is zero, verifying that it is a horizontal line. Since the slope of M = V, slope of M is -70 at C and is constant slope to D (straight line). To get the magnitude of the bending moment at C, I simply took the maximum moment (at D) of 285 and subtracted the area under the shear diagram (area A3) between C and D. 285–140–145. EDIT: Let’s assume you didn’t calculate the reactions at the support. To get the magnitude of the bending moment at each point, simply calculate the area’s under the shear force diagram as follows: Starting for the left side, area [math]A_2[/math] = (25)(1)=25 kNm. this is the change in the moment diagram from point A to B. The change in the moment diagram from B to C equals the area above the [math]x_2[/math] curve in the V-diagram = [math]A_4+A_5[/math]. [math]A_4[/math] = (3)(25)=75 kNm and the formula for [math]A_5[/math] is [math]frac{1}{3}BH=frac{1}{3}(3)(70-25)[/math] = 45 kNm So the total change in the bending moment from point A to B = [math]A_2+A_4+A_5[/math] = 25+75+45 = 145 kNm. And finally, adding [math]A_3[/math] =140 gives the moment at D. i.e. 145+140=285 kNm."},{"instruction":"What’s the major differences between an ENTJ and an INTJ?","output":"If you were to spend 5 hours at a family reunion would you feel empowered and energized at that 5 hour mark, or feel drained and need some time to yourself doing your own thing to recharge?

For example, the Siberian tiger is the largest cat and can weigh up to 700 pounds, while the largest dog breed, the Saint Bernard, only weighs up to about 260 pounds. There are several reasons why dogs are generally smaller than big cats. One reason is that big cats are carnivorous predators that need to be able to take down large prey, so they have evolved to be larger and stronger. Dogs, on the other hand, are omnivorous and have not needed to evolve to be as large in order to survive. Additionally, dogs have been bred by humans for a wide variety of purposes, and size has not always been a top priority."},{"instruction":"got my first pet dog a week ago, and I want to be prepared for any emergencies (for instance, choking, or anything important.

Tell your partner to leave. I remember 43 years ago when I met my husband. I had a Doberman with the cropped ears. She was beautiful but she was a doberman and that was all he needed to know. He believed in the old reputation about Dobermans that they “kill” their masters. However, I had just divorced my ex and fought for custody of my dog (it was written in the divorce paperwork). I was awarded custody with occasional visitation by my ex. The doberman, Sheba, was very friendly but my then boyfriend (current husband) was afraid of her. Of coarse it didn’t help one night while trying to show how sweet she was, I called out to her for help. She came charging down the hallway like a locomotive ready to protect me. He freaked out and ran for cover. I know it was a dumb thing to do but I was young (23) and I knew she would not hurt him. Anyway, after a couple weeks of knowing him, he was starting to get rather serious with our relationship. (He moves quickly….lol. He was already counting down days to marry me). One night while we were talking, he gently told me that he really wanted to marry me but there was one problem. He did not want Sheba…and he wanted me to get rid of her.

The city means very different things to different people, home to over 12 million people, here are some very interesting yet lesser know facts about Mumbai that you should read! 1. Mumbai has only 1.1 square meters of open space per person. Either way, that’s less per person than in New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mexico City and, yes, even Tokyo, making Mumbai not only one of the densest, but also the most cramped city in the world.(It’s not the same) 2. Mumbai has a coastline of over 149 kilometers It may not look true but with its oceanfront beaches, stunning black rock outcrops leafy mangroves, wetlands, rivers and creeks, Mumbai surely has a long shoreline. 3. The name Mumbai was derived from Mumba Devi and Bombay from… From Bom Bahia, literally meaning ‘The Good Bay’. Bombay was actually named by Portuguese explorer Francis Almeida. The present day name ‘Mumbai’ is named after goddess Mumba devi of the Koli community. 4. Mumbai initiated the first of many amenities in the whole of India The Juhu Aerodrome was the first airport of India, the Taj Mahal Hotel, founded in 1903, is India’s first 5 star hotel and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) railway station is the first railway station in India. 5. The Dabbahwallahs’ century-old delivery system is recognised as one of the best managed supply chains in the world. Forbes magazine awarded the dabbawalah network with its highest rating, Sigma Six—a rating that is shared with corporate giants like General Electric and Motorola, it signifies less than one error per one million transactions. 6. India’s first—and now most outdated—electric rail system. Instead of receiving electricity from a third rail, Mumbai is powered by miles of wire that run above the tracks, carrying electricity through a complex network of substations. This DC system was installed far back in 1925. 7. ‘Super Dense Crush Load’- A official term to describe what happens during rush hour in Mumbai Mumbai trains were built to hold 1700 passengers, but they often carry three times that number, leading to such notorious crowding that railways have given peak hours a special name: the ‘Super Dense Crush Load’ 8.

Whatever happened to keeping the enemy in the dark of your plans? Is it just politics, hubris or stupidity?","output":"It's not necessary to keep this a secret besides you couldn't keep something this big a secret anyway. I don't know if you understand this or not however almost the entire world is against Russia right now because of their illegal invasion into Ukraine. Everybody is looking for ways to help Ukraine any way they can right now. The question I have is: why do you think that they need to keep this a secret? Or even could keep this a secret, even if they wanted to? Even if Putin where to win in Ukraine, he will not be able to withstand the continuing onslaught of of ever-increasing sanctions against Russia and military assistance to Ukraine. This means that even if Putin wins he will eventually have to let it go of Ukraine. It's kind of like running up to the nest of an ostrich and stealing its egg, only to realize that the mother is never going to give up chasing you until you let go of that egg. The western states are never ever going to give up going after Russia as long as they still have blood stained hands. That's why the Soviet Union failed because they stole too much land from people and over the course of decades the western states never gave up attacking Russia in any way they could. This condition was so predominant that they even gave it a name. They called it the “Cold War\\", and the Russians lived a substandard existence, as compared to the rest of the world, until they gave up and let go of all the nations that they had formally stolen. The reason history is taught in schools is so that we do not repeat it. The western states are not going to allow Vladimir Putin to restore Russia to the old Soviet style form of government, because the Soviet Union was based on Russian aggression. You can accept what I'm telling you, or you can reject it. However whatever attitude you choose to embrace you are still not going to escape the consequences of long lasting worldwide sanctions and attacks from every democracy on this planet. Welcome to the new Cold War of every increasing sanctions and learning to exist without many of the benefits of modern-day society. You cannot keep something this big a secret, because there are far too many nations involved. So far, over 30 Nations have supplied Ukraine with weapons, ammunition, money and supplies. One of them is not even a nation, it's just an organization called the European Union. So far 300 companies have closed down their businesses in Russia. Some of those companies are very large such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's Ikea, Volvo, Ford, Renault. It's like Hitler knew that there was going to be an invasion in Europe, he just didn't know where, and he did not have an exact date either. Well the Russians can expect the same, they know they're going to get attacked they just don't know where, or when, or even how. However there are some things that should give you a clue and one of those things is the fact that you're paying twice as much for your electronics such as your phones and other electrical equipment. The other thing that should give you a clue is that you cannot get dollars or euros anymore. A third clue is about 30% of the stores in the large malls in Russia are closed. Two of those mainstream retail outlets are McDonald's and Ikea. These are things that should warn you that dark clouds are just over the horizon. Let Ukraine go, it's not worth the huge price you are going to pay for it. You have already lost up to 15,000 of your soldiers and one of your very large ships. It's not necessary to keep a secret about the assistance that we are providing to Ukraine because it is so incredibly huge that there is nothing Russia will be able to do to stop it. It's like a steamroller that flattens out asphalt pavement, the wheels grind slowly, but they do grind.. rhetorically speaking this worldwide assistance for Ukraine will be the grinding steamroller. That Russian ship that got sunk, that convoy that got all the personnel carriers and the tanks blown up, all those Russian soldiers that died, that's just the tip iceberg, there's a lot more coming, we are just getting started. Something this big is nearly impossible to keep quiet and once it gets rolling it does not stop on a dime, it takes a long time stop it. So it's simply not necessary to keep these things a secret because there's no way Russia can stop it. I think it's better that the Russians know what's coming their way and give them a chance to stand down and get out of Ukraine before we unleash the full authority and strength of all these democratic nations against Russia. know this, Ukraine is not alone, they have friends, lots of friends. Some of those friends are extremely powerful. No matter how strong people think Russia is, they are no match for the entire rest of the world. They know that eventually Ukraine's going to get fighter jets and high-tech combat attack helicopters. That's going to allow the Ukrainians to push Russia out of Ukraine and then go down to Crimea and push them out of that warm water port. It is not possible to keep these things a secret with so many countries involved and so many people involved. Like I say again, I don't think people understand that Russia has the weight of the world bearing down on them like a ravenous beast, it descends toward Russia like the dark clouds of a developing hurricane over the horizon, and this blows in ill wind for Russia. Each day Russia has less and less time to remove itself from Ukraine. Hitler thought he was strong enough and tough enough to take anyone on, however he found himself being attacked from several different directions all at once the same will happen here with Russia. Russia cannot fight the whole world."},{"instruction":"People say that I shouldn't give Parle G to stray dogs. So, what should I give them to eat?

And so, I do grudgingly say: it is virtually impossible to “leapfrog” in this manner; to meaningfully solve a differential equation without having an understanding of what a derivative is. Likewise, when the Laplace transform method fails—which it does—you will have no idea why. Rather than jumping to Laplace transforms, it would be much wiser to start with applied differential calculus."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Some Blogging Tips To Earn More Money in 2023here are thousands of bloggers who make money blogging.

This can contribute to higher reported rates.The rise of technology and social media has brought both benefits and challenges. While they provide connectivity and access to information, they can also contribute to increased feelings of loneliness, social isolation and negative self-comparisons, which can impact mental well-being.Modern Society factors such as academic pressure, high expectations, economic uncertainties, and a fast-paced lifestyle can contribute to feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.Environmental factors, such as pollution, climate change, and natural disasters, can impact mental health.Shifts in family structures, increased divorce rates, and changing parenting styles can impact the well-being of individuals, including their mental health.We have unprecedented access to information, including news about global issues, social injustices, and personal tragedies.

This can lead to untreated depression and exacerbate the issue. It's essential to approach this topic with sensitivity and recognize that there are many factors at play. While certain factors may contribute to higher rates of depression, it's crucial to avoid generalizing an entire generation's experiences.

No, Izuku is nowhere near Goku's power, even on Izuku's best day and Goku's worst. However, the very nature of Goku's power means that he could reduce it as much as he wants to at any given time. If he can reduce it so much that he can be bruised by a bullet from a pistol, he can absolutely choose to lower it to the point where Deku could one-shot him. I am in no way saying that Deku is stronger than Goku, in fact if you actually read the answer I'm saying the exact opposite. Edit 2, copied from an earlier comment: Hopefully I won't have to clarify this again on this answer but I'm not arguing that Deku would beat Goku, because he wouldn't and not by a long shot. Rather I'm saying that there is a specific circumstance entirely within the power of both characters where Deku could beat Goku, and that difference is important. Whether they know they're fighting each other, want to fight each other, or have the ability to quickly raise their defenses is irrelevant to the conversation. The question was about a possible scenario, not a probable one, and that's what I answered. It'd be dishonest for me to deny it just because I like Goku more than Deku. The real answer begins below. ——————————— Goku is naturally very strong even at rest, but his defenses weaken significantly when he's off guard. This is because he lowers his power when he believes the battle is won, in order to avoid exhausting himself unnecessarily (and probably also to avoid destroying his surroundings by accident). He has, in the past, acclimated to an elevated state (Super Saiyan during the Cell saga) to the point where the form didn't stress him at all, but he still reverts back to normal and lowers his power to this day. Now to be clear, in his base form Goku is still many times Universal level, but even after achieving this power he's shown to take damage from weak attacks if he's goofing around. Examples: bruised from a normal round from a pistol after catching a full clip from an assault rifle with no issue. And of course, being injured by Sorbet's Bad Ring Laser after having a universal level fight with Frieza. Now to be fair, Sorbet's Laser was made with some of the most advanced technology in the known universe, but that doesn't discount the fact that this only worked after Goku relaxed from fighting Frieza. Goku could be “off guard” and reduce his power to such a level that anything could hurt him. That includes Deku, especially using the powers of One For All. ——————————— Postscript; hopefully the final edit. If you've finished reading the answer, I ask that you read it one more time and really think about what is being said. A lot of the comments are either completely misinterpreting what I'm saying, or are showing a lack of understanding of a basic element of Dragon Ball's power system. Either way, I'd rather not have to keep coming back to clarify. The important parts are in bold."},{"instruction":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","output":"Santorini, Greece: Famous for its whitewashed houses and stunning views of the Aegean Sea, Santorini is a truly breathtaking destination.Bora Bora, French Polynesia: This island paradise is known for its crystal-clear waters, overwater bungalows, and lush tropical scenery.The Maldives: Comprised of over 1,000 islands, the Maldives is known for its stunning beaches, turquoise lagoons, and incredible underwater scenery.The Amalfi Coast, Italy: With its colorful seaside villages, dramatic cliffs, and crystal-clear waters, the Amalfi Coast is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world.Yosemite National Park, USA: This stunning national park is home to towering granite cliffs, thundering waterfalls, and some of the most beautiful natural scenery in the world.Machu Picchu, Peru: This ancient Incan city is perched high in the Andes Mountains, surrounded by stunning mountain scenery and breathtaking views.The Taj Mahal, India: One of the most famous landmarks in the world, the Taj Mahal is a stunning example of Mughal architecture, with its white marble dome and intricate carvings.The Backwaters of Kerala, India: These peaceful waterways are lined with coconut trees and traditional houseboats, offering a glimpse into the tranquil way of life in southern India.The Golden Temple, India: This iconic Sikh temple in Amritsar is covered in gold and surrounded by a beautiful reflecting pool, making it one of the most stunning religious sites in the world.The Himalayas, India: This majestic mountain range is home to some of the highest peaks in the world, including Mount Everest, and offers stunning views of snow-capped peaks, serene valleys, and picturesque mountain villages.

Choose a location that is comfortable for both of you and aligns with your interests. A good date idea is something that allows for conversation and getting to know each other better. Tip 4: Keep the Conversation Flowing Conversation is essential on a first date, but it can be challenging to keep it flowing smoothly. Start by asking open-ended questions that require more than a yes or no answer. Listen actively to your date and respond with your own experiences or opinions. Avoid controversial topics or discussing your exes. Tip 5: Relax and Have Fun Last but not least, relax and have fun! First dates can be nerve-wracking, but remember that your date is probably feeling the same way. If things don’t go as planned, don’t stress about it. Enjoy the moment and focus on getting to know your date better. In conclusion, a successful first date requires effort and preparation, but it’s worth it in the end. Be yourself, dress appropriately, plan ahead, keep the conversation flowing, and most importantly, relax and have fun.

From the vastness of the universe to the intricacies of ourselves, there are countless facts that expand our understanding and leave us in awe. In this “article”, we will explore some of the most fascinating facts that will make you marvel at the incredible intricacies of our world. A. The Scale of the Universe: The universe is vast beyond our comprehension. Consider this mind-blowing fact: There are more stars in the observable universe than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of Earth combined. Our planet is just a tiny speck in the cosmic expanse, reminding us of the immense scale of the universe we inhabit. B. Time Dilation: According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time is not constant. As objects move faster or come closer to massive gravitational forces, time actually slows down for them. This means that time can pass differently for someone on a spaceship travelling near the speed of light compared to someone on Earth. The concept of time dilation is truly mind-blowing and challenges our everyday perception of time. C. Quantum Entanglement Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle affects the state of the others, regardless of the distance between them. This mind-boggling concept suggests that particles can be instantaneously linked, defying our understanding of traditional cause and effect. D. The Power of the Human Brain: The human brain is an incredible organ, capable of amazing feats. Did you know that the human brain can generate more electrical impulses in a single day than all the telephones in the world combined? It's a testament to the astonishing complexity and power of our minds. E. The Age of the Earth: The Earth is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years old. To put this into perspective, if we compressed the Earth's entire lifespan into just 24 hours, humans would have only existed for the last few seconds. This fact underscores the incredible history and evolution of our planet. F. The Depths of the Oceans: The oceans hold mysteries that are still largely unexplored. It is estimated that we have explored less than 5% of the world's oceans. The remaining 95% remains a vast and unknown realm, filled with unique ecosystems and potentially undiscovered species. The sheer depth and complexity of the oceans continue to astonish us. G. The Power of the Sun Our Sun is a colossal source of energy, emitting an incredible amount of light and heat. In just one second, the Sun produces enough energy to satisfy the world's energy needs for over 500,000 years. This mind-blowing fact reminds us of the immense power that exists within our own star. In Conclusion… The world is a treasure trove of mind-blowing facts that expand our understanding of the universe and challenge our perceptions. From the vastness of the cosmos to the mysteries of quantum physics, these mind-blowing facts remind us of the beauty, complexity, and limitless possibilities that surround us. By exploring and appreciating these astonishing facts, we can cultivate a sense of wonder and curiosity, continually seeking to unravel the secrets of our extraordinary world.

Be clear about ESE and GATE - Many aspirants think that they can crack both these exams simultaneously but end up with nothing in hand. Go through the syllabus of both these exams first and then decide what you want to go for.Unnecessarily going for ref books for each subject - If you have joined any coaching or have taken any class notes then don't waste your time with ref book. For gate exam ref books are irrelevant , class notes of any institutes are designed by experts who have read atleast 5 ref books for each subjects so these notes are to the point and precise.Giving less importance to previous gate questions- One should solve previous GATE questions atleast 3 times. Many aspirants ignore these questions and keep solving class practise problems rigorously . Each gate question , has some concepts associated with it .Giving less number of online tests - In GATE exam everything depends on practise. Online mock tests practise improves time management, scientific calculator usage . One should give as many mocks and CBTs as possible.Easily getting demotivated by test scores and not analyzing tests properly - If you are getting less marks then first analyze those mistakes and make sure that you spend at least one and half hour after each Full length test in analyzing it.Wasting too much time on GATE group and other preparation apps- People just for show-off purpose discuss irrelevant questions for an hour on these platform instead use these platform just for receiving any notification or practising quizzes.Not creating short notes and not revising it properly - One should prepare short notes by self and should not copy from someone else. Short notes should be revised on daily basis atleast for one hour in the last wo months of exam. Trust me plenty of these mistakes are also committed by me in initial days during my first attempt which did cost me an year .

What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","output":"There were 2 key reasons, depending on the location. Firstly the UK had superior military technology until relatively recently. Whilst that didnt mean they could overcome everything, it did mean that a small number of troops could exercise control over a significant number of opponents. If you look, particularly at places like Africa, the British Soldiers were generally able to control the local population fairly easily. They cocked up at the start of the Zulu wars, but soon made amends, and defeated a hugely superior force. Where they struggled in South Africa, was against the Boers who had similar technology, and were able to use it. One part of the UK technology was the military system - being able to have a standing army that could drill and so had a large amount of cohesion to fight efficiently was crucial. The British also had access to naval power, which meant that for areas that were within a short distance of the coast, troops could be moved very quickly. This enabled the British to focus resources in the spots of the world where they were needed relatively quickly. Again with the zulu wars, after the initial set-back, it took a while, but the British were able to bring in a number of troops from elsewhere to take control. However there were places where the numbers of locals or the territory were so vast that this wouldnt work directly. The other major skill of the British was their ability to co-ordinate locals to help and support, and even give permission for the British to take over. India is the excellent example - the initial British forays were almost totally based on trade. However, by some chance, there happened to be an army around to fight the French which was no longer needed, and some Indian bankers decided to do a deal to get the British to remove the local rulers. Everyone was happy - the British gained control of a lot of India and the bankers got a large return on their loans, and support in becoming even more powerful. I think the situation of the ‘peasants’ was relatively unchanged - I dont think they were necessarily well treated by their Indian rulers - but the British could be just as bad. After a while the British also started using locals as troops. They were so successful that a lot of Indian troops became incredibly proficient - with the Ghurkas still playing a prominent part in the British and other armies. Part of the influence that the British could bring to bear was the massive trade advantage. They could easily find foreign goods that could bribe peoples (and generally rulers) to support the British - and then supply them through trade roots. In some cases the locals didnt really want foreign goods, so the British got them hooked on Cocaine and supplied that."},{"instruction":"What are the most controversial statements of Bollywood stars?","output":"they not earn from bollywood… lol"},{"instruction":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","output":"Ferrari 250 GTO2.

Fact: MediCare is similar to Social Security in some ways. The differences are that it is not necessarily 100% funded through payroll taxes and is, I think, part of the general fund. I'm unsure about MedicAid. Blaming Social Security for the deficit is a huge lie. McConnell keeps saying it. Ryan keeps saying it. Bunches of other hard line conservatives agree, and it's complete bull. The deficit is skyrocketing because these morons cut taxes. Thus means tax revenues are down.

Would you still have to have a priest?","output":"Q: How does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God? Would you still have to have a priest? A: You seem to be under the impression that marriage is a religious thing. It’s not. Marriage is a civil contract about legal obligations between cohabitating people. It’s about contracts, inheritance, taxation, co-ownership, legal guardianship of offspring and a lot of other things. On top of that, you can opt to include one or more gods, but you don’t have to. If you don’t want to include gods, you can book an appointment with the mayor or an official for a civil marriage ceremony at the town hall, or even at other locations if we want. That official then proclaims the marriage. They don’t do blessings because of the separation of church and state (with the exception of the royal family), but generally they convey their well-wishes and good luck. In many countries, the civil marriage is the only thing that counts; the religious stuff is from the legal point of view only mumbo-jumbo and has no influence on the validity or the legality of the marriage. Even when the civil and religious duties are performed by a priest acting as an officiant, the marriage is still only valid when the paperwork done by said priest is sent in, not when the priest declares the couple to be married."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"“That acid attack seized my face.

Many of the advantages we've seen in this setting can be attributed to the introduction of new technology options for students. The biggest benefit is the access to an infinite amount of current information and data from various sources. Aside from the fact that students approach learning with greater enthusiasm and productivity, they also have access to the most recent topics and research, which their forefathers could only dream of. Instead of dragging a stack of books from library to library, they are only a few clicks and well-defined queries away from accessing information that can provide them with additional insight into the topics they are studying at school. As a result, this practice not only provides students with a modern education, but it also teaches them how to approach information searches and read complex professional literature. Students also learn digital literacy through technology. Students are given the opportunity to keep up with learning trends and acquire technological/digital skills that are highly sought after in the twenty-first century by incorporating technology as an integral part of education. Disadvantages of teaching with Technology Students may be distracted by the presence of technology. When children play video games, they may exhibit addiction-like behaviours. More than anything else, their attention is drawn to the entertainment they receive. If the educational environment encourages learning through reward-based games, the child may be more concerned with what they receive from the software or app rather than what they are learning. Some students may become disconnected from the classroom as a result of using technology. Being behind a screen gives you a level of anonymity that a face-to-face conversation does not. We must encourage social interactions that accurately communicate thoughts, feelings, or emotions so that a child can still make a better life for themselves even when they are not online. There is a lot of information on the Internet today that is fake or exaggerated in some way, but it masquerades as being real. Some students may not know the difference between reliable and unreliable resources. Final word Technology in the classroom creates more opportunities for self-discovery by opening more doors, introducing new experiences, and introducing new experiences. However technology does have some disadvantages. As a result, a continued emphasis on disadvantages should not be interpreted as a desire to return to traditional education, but rather as a reason for caution and the opportunity to better see the flaws in educational technologies and methods."},{"instruction":"there anything about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash that just doesn’t add up?","output":"honestly, everything."},{"instruction":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","output":"All videos UPSC This channel provides recorded lectures for upsc preparation free of cost.

I guarantee you will not be able to convince your husband or wife that there was no global flood in the last 10000 years by using science but the only chance you’ve got is by using the Bible. Mention that the logic used here is from a Christian, I’m sorry but I don’t think that a fundamentalist Christian would believe what a non-Christian says about the Bible if it disagrees with their view of the Bible but they’ll most likely instead think that you have been misinformed about the Bible. So tell them that this logic here is from a fundamentalist, Bible-believing Christian (I am a fundamentalist Christian). The only verse in Genesis which says that Noah’s flood covered “the whole earth” is Genesis 8:9 and it’s most likely hyperbolic because the Bible also says that the mountains were seen by Noah and his family. ‘And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen. So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground. But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself.’ (Genesis 8:5–9) Genesis 41:56–57 refers to the whole earth as the people of the earth and the Hebrew saying “all the earth” is the same as when Genesis 8 says that the floodwaters covered the face of the “whole earth”. ‘So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.’ (Genesis 41:56–57) Not only that but Genesis 2:11 uses the same Hebrew phrase hyperbolically. ‘The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.’ (Genesis 2:11) So to suggest that Genesis 8:9 means that the flood was global implies that the Pishon river literally flows around the entirety of Arabia (the Biblical Havilah is Arabia) and the absurdity that planet earth or the dry land on earth literally moved to Egypt to buy grain. Another objection is that the Bible says that all the animals and humans died. ‘Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.’ (Genesis 7:22–23) But this is hyperbolic because the Bible says that all that animals on the ark survived and if all the animals did die then they could’ve been living in that relatively small region of the world where the flood occured. Not only that but Joshua 10:13 is from perspective when it says that the sun stood still when Joshua was fighting the Amorites so that they could keep fighting the Amorite without it becoming night: ‘At that time Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.” And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.’ (Joshua 10:12–13) Matthew 4:8 which says that Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world is also from perspective: ‘Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”’ (Matthew 4:8–9) Either these verses are from perspective or the Bible’s got it wrong. Similarly why can’t the flood be told from Noah’s perspective when we see that happening consistently in the Bible? Geologists have found flood deposits which are 10 feet thick near the Ancient Sumerian city of Shuruppak that have been calculated to be from around 2900BC. Mesopotamia is a very flat region so the water needed to flood one city on the plain between the Tigris and Ephrates rivers is actually the same amount as the water needed to flood the entire plain and because it’s a very flat region so the water would have nowhere to go for a long time so it could definitely last for 1 year and 10 days like the Bible says. An objection which may be raised to this might be that Noah's flood was in 2348BC if you add up the genealogies in the Bible but we must keep in mind that the copies of the old testament we have in many Bible translations are from the Masoretic text and hot our oldest copies of the old testament. When we look at older copies of the old testament and older texts using these genealogies as chrono-genealogies we get dates for the flood that go all the way back to 3299BC: Then the flood could end by God sending a wind to blow the water out of the area like the Bible says: ‘But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.’ (Genesis 8:1) This verse makes no sense with a global flood. How could the water drain caused by a wind in a global flood? The only mechanism that I know of for the waters draining in a global flood scenario is by catastrophic plate tectonics causing mountains to rise and ocean basins to deepen where the water would fill until all that water is drained off the parts of the world that we see today. But this is not caused by a wind and it’s not literally draining the water but it appears to be draining from perspective when in reality the continents are getting pushed up by rapid plate movement so if global flood proponents will admit that this is from perspective then why can't the whole flood account be told from Noah’s perspective? The Mesopotamian flood in 2900BC would’ve had dimensions at all points over 15 miles wide and Noah would’ve only been able to see for a range of around 15 miles so you’ve got a worldwide flood at least from Noah’s perspective Geolgists have found convincing evidence for a flood on the plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers with a depth of 105 feet occuring in 2900BC. Another objection is the misconception that the Bible says that the ark landed on Mount Ararat: ‘…and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.’ (Genesis 8:4) Keep in mind that the Bible says the mountains of Ararat, not Mount Ararat so it seems to imply that it could’ve landed on a mountain near Mount Ararat or in the region where Mount Ararat was which includes Mount Judi, the traditional landing place of the ark as recorded in the dead sea scrolls. Also keep in mind that the kingdom of Ararat was an Armenian kingdom that became a large empire between 1300BC and 600BC and according to Judeo-Christian tradition and the Jewish Talmud Moses wrote the Pentateuch in around 1300BC. Mount Judi and Mount Cudi are in the right place to be flooded by the flood of the Tigris and Euphrates floodplain. Considering this context, this suggests that the mountains of Ararat were simply mountains that were found in what was the kingdom of Ararat when Moses wrote the Pentateuch. Unfortunately, the old Armenian tradition of Noah’s ark landing on Mount Judi stopped because Mount Ararat is even higher than Mount Judi/Cudi. Here’s an image of the durupinar site with Mount Cudi seen near it (sorry for the poor quality)."},{"instruction":"When is the right time to hire a virtual assistant for your Amazon Fba business?","output":"Here is my five step process for getting a new virtual assistant, freelancer, or agency. Before you get started looking at your numbers for last month, figure out how aggressive or conservative you want to be. Do you want to invest 40-60% of your profits into people or 10-30%? We are all in a different place in our life and in our business. Figure out a % that makes sense for you. You can always go up or down slightly next month. First step is to figure out what you want to take off your plate. If you are stuck inside your day to day operations, create a list of everything you do on a month to month basis. Assign some number values to each task. How many hours a week do you spend doing it? What price per hour is the task? Prioritize that list so things that are low dollar value with lots of hours spent are at the top. If you are someone where projects are building up or you are focusing on things too far away from your core competency, create a list of your weaknesses. Figure out what you are the best at and get in the mentality of delegating everything else. Prioritize the list of weakness by ROI. Once you have these two lists, you can establish what you want to hire for first. Second, pick one thing from one of the lists to delegate first. Step two is about figuring out what your ideal hire looks like. Is it a full time employee in your office? A virtual assistant in the Philippines? A freelancer? An agency? Figure out the price point, the skills they need to have, and the commitment they need to make. Think of the type of people you work well with. What character traits do they have? Your goal here is to really define what your perfect hire looks like. Once you have your perfect hire defined, you are ready for step three. Figure out what site or resource you want to hire from and create a posting. Step three is all about interviewing. When you interview, you are focused on four things: (1) Skill - Not everyone you hire needs to be a 10/10. There are a time and a place for a 6/10 or 3/10. What you care about is that they are honest about what they can and cannot do, and that they are priced accordingly. (2) Attitude - Hire people that are positive and passionate about what they do. It has to be more than just about money. You want people who don’t get aggressive the moment something doesn’t go their way. People who can take feedback well. (3) Communication - Communication is everything. If someone has the attitude and skill, but you can’t communicate with them it doesn’t work out. Obviously, they have to speak your language at a high level, but communication is so much more than that. Find people who can hit deadlines, don’t let personal issues interfere with work, and can use the communication channels that you like at a high level. (4) Are they the right fit for me - Even the best virtual assistant/freelancers in the world are not the best fit for every business owner out there. Is this person going to work well with your management, communication and work style? Your interview questions should be focused on these things. Not looking for the right answers, but instead looking for the wrong answers. What are the red flags? What is this person saying that shows they might not have the skill, attitude, communication that I want? Found someone you like from step 3? Now it is time for step 4: setting expectations. This is the part most entrepreneurs miss. Get on the same page with your hire right from the beginning. Define success and failure for their first project. Establish what communication systems you use and when you use them. Let them know who in your company to go to for what. Let them know about your pet peeves and dealbreakers. Your goal is to make everything black and white (in writing). Give them a chance to back out after you have established your expectations. You only want people who are 100% okay with them and can handle them at a high level. Don’t compromise here. Once you have established expectations, the final step and my personal favorite is the feedback loop. Give them feedback early and often. If they are a writer, show them parts of their writing you like and parts you don’t. Be specific with examples. If they are meeting or not meeting your expectations, tell them. The feedback goes both ways. Make sure you ask for feedback and ideas too. Some of the best ideas/feedback that has made or saved me hundreds of thousands of dollars came from other people. This only happened because I was open to listening and improving. The feedback loop never stops. Delegation is the key to growing your business and it is almost impossible to scale without it. Hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"What do teenagers wish adults understood?","output":"Something that i have noticed is that humans have a tendencey of exaggerating and also victimising the past they have lived and i think the reason is because it helps them justify their present condition whatever it may be. This happens with everyone, like I always think that the kids now a days are using smart phones too leisurely and parents let them do it so they remain distracted, but it still makes me think about when I was a kid and I did not have any smart devices except T. V (shinchan basically). As a teenager though I wish that adults understand that It doesn't matter how much experience they have they really don't know about the kind of insecurities teens haveWorld is changing and if we don't change (not totally) we are really going to face some problems in futureBeing constantly in phone doesn't mean that we have Bf/Gf (I can confidently say that 80 percent of teens don't have one , they just have a good imagination😂)Most teens have a problem of fantasizing, scolding them about daydreaming is not going to solve anythingTeens do have dreams and goals and we are worried about our career (most not all) but adults need to understand that our career is going to be shaped with time and rushing is not going to get us anywhere. Something that teens need to understand (including myself 😅) is that some people who genuinely love and care us are going to be worried about us and we can do nothing about it until death.

Thermal conductivity says how much thermal energy will permeate a material in a unit amount of time, whereas thermal diffusivity says how much area a unit of energy will permeate in a unit amount of time. If not, what am I missing?","output":"An increase in temperature may also cause an increase in the number of ions in solution due to dissociation of molecules. As the conductivity of a solution is dependent on these factors then an increase in the solution's temperature will lead to an increase in its conductivity. This model is also valid in solids. In heat transfer analysis, thermal diffusivity is the thermal conductivity divided by density and specific heat capacity at constant pressure. It measures the rate of transfer of heat of a material from the hot end to the cold end. ... Thermal diffusivity is usually denoted α but a,h,κ, K, and D are also used.

Please note that my response is based on observations and general insights rather than specific scientific data. Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that mental health issues, including depression, have always existed across generations. However, in recent times, there has been a shift in societal attitudes and increased awareness surrounding mental health. This has led to more open discussions and a better understanding of these conditions, resulting in more people seeking help and receiving diagnoses. Now, when it comes to why this generation appears to have a higher prevalence of depression, there are several factors to consider. One significant aspect is the fast-paced and interconnected nature of our modern world. With the rise of technology and social media, young people today are constantly exposed to a barrage of information, comparisons, and unrealistic expectations. This can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, isolation, and a sense of constantly needing to \\"keep up\\" or be perfect. Moreover, the current generation faces unique challenges, such as economic uncertainties, academic pressures, and social issues. These stressors can take a toll on mental well-being and potentially contribute to higher levels of depression. On a personal note, I've seen the impact of these factors on the lives of my own children and their peers. The pressures they face in school, the constant digital presence, and the challenges of navigating an ever-changing world have undoubtedly affected their mental health and contributed to feelings of depression at times. However, it's essential to remember that every generation has its own set of struggles and that generalizations should be approached with caution. Not everyone within this generation is affected by depression, and individuals' experiences can vary greatly. To address this issue, it's crucial for society to continue fostering open conversations about mental health, providing support systems, and promoting self-care practices. It's also important for individuals to seek professional help when needed, as mental health is a complex matter that often requires specialized treatment. In the end, my friend, understanding and empathy go a long way in supporting each other through these challenges, regardless of the generation we belong to."},{"instruction":"What two Running Backs should I start in week 5 fantasy football, I’ve got Matt Brieda v.

They had teachers much like the ones in their public school - sometimes literally the same teachers, but the administration was much more capable. There was one child in the public school who had been asked to leave the private school after a few weeks. The teacher who had to deal with this child had at the same time a class double the size of the previous year’s, and had been forced to implement a new pre-reading program that the foolish district administration had paid big bucks for without getting any teacher input on how it would work in their classrooms.

Cross-platform compatibility: Java is a cross-platform language, which means that the same code can run on different operating systems without modification. This makes it easier to develop and deploy Minecraft on a wide range of devices. 2. Large existing codebase: Minecraft has been in development since 2009, and the original codebase was written in Java. It would be a significant effort to rewrite the entire game in C++ or another language, especially since the existing codebase has been optimized and improved over the years. 3. Performance improvements: While Java may not be as performant as C++ for 3D games, there are ways to optimize Java code for better performance. In fact, Minecraft has undergone several performance optimizations over the years to improve its performance on lower-end hardware. 4. Familiarity with the language: The Minecraft development team is likely very familiar with Java, and it may be more efficient for them to continue using Java rather than learning a new language. Overall, while Java may not be the optimal choice for 3D games, Minecraft is still written in Java because of its cross-platform compatibility, large existing codebase, performance optimizations, and familiarity with the language."},{"instruction":"Where can I find a wholesale women’s clothing supplier?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Garment mantra] [URL: https://www.garmentmantra.com/] is the best place to buy women’s clothes with best quality.

They were the worst place I have ever been to. The first time I was there, I was there with a woman with a disorder where her blood was super thin as well as never coming off of her period. She had a daughter at home and her and her husband were hoping for another child once her mental health was better. Well she had to take various medications for this at specific times, but tge staff refused to give them to her. They said that she would get her medications only at the scheduled times with everyone else, which was in the morning, noon, and bedtime. She was at the nurse's station crying and pounding on the window, begging for her medications while she bled all over the floor. Eventually she passed out due to blood loss and the staff moved her to a chair. Another patient was an EMT and he went OFF on the staff for not helping her or checking her vitals. The woman eventually got her meds and demanded to go to the ER. The staff refused. She called her mom, who was a lawyer and had her obgyn call Streamwood about her medications. She ended up having to go to the hospital for an emergency hysterectomy because of what the staff did with her meds. The second time was how they treated me. I'm autistic, so I have sensory issues. Well a code green happened and they made everyone go to the day room. I was already having a rough time, so I asked if I could just stay in my room. They said no. I ended up going full into meltdown for the first time in 7 years. They then made me go to the “quiet room\\" which was basically a huge echo chamber where you could hear everything going on in the day room, but louder and everywhere at once. This sent me into a second meltdown. The staff then came in and insisted I talk with them and explain what was wrong. Well I am nonverbal for a period of time after meltdowns, so I couldn't. They started getting irritated and told me “Use your voice like a big girl, you aren't a baby\\" After no luck and them just stressing me out further, they tried to get me to take anti-anxiety medicine. I wanted so bad to tell them that “No! That's not what I need, what I need is to be left alone in my room, where it is actually quiet!”"},{"instruction":"What are some effective software tools that an inside sales team can use to boost productivity?","output":"Sales teams have to constantly struggle with overload of emails, calls and correspondence for reviews.

There is no reform. Laws only affect law-abiding citizens. We don’t break the law so what is there to reform. If these laws reformed criminals, then current rape, murder, robbery, etc. laws would reform criminals and they do not since we still have crime. There is no compromise, because any and all gun laws only take away from law-abiding gun owner’s rights, but gives nothing in return. To have compromise, both sides have to give up something. When they limit gun magazines to 10 rounds and tell the law-abiding citizen, “Hey, you are grandfathered in so if you already own a magazine with greater than 10 rounds you can keep it.”, it is not a compromise. I already have the right to have any kind of magazine, you are not compromising to give me “large capacity” magazines, you are just taking away my right to purchase them going forward. Which, they usually end up taking that away to later in the future. There is no common sense gun law. Again, criminals do not care what the law says so how can it be common sense when it limits my rights, but does nothing to reduce crime or criminals having guns. Lastly, most times the gun charges are reduced or dropped anyways, and the criminal is charged with maybe the robbery. This is mostly done because if the criminal decides to take his case up the ladder and it ends up in the SCOTUS, the case could get overturned because the criminals 2nd Amendment right was infringed on."},{"instruction":"What is an Amazon egift card?","output":"It’s an Amazon gift card that is emailed to you.

I don’t find any comparative analysis done between Sanskrit & the European languages because most of the western linguists had drawn conclusions only on the basis of few numericals and few words like Mother, Brother, Father etc… but the language is not just only about numericals. In the early 19th century, the British colonizers deputed their scholars to study the native languages and scriptures of India and they realized that the Aryans of India, Iran and Europe had a surprising deal of commonalities in their languages. They thought these languages seem to have emerged from a common language called the proto Indo European language (PIE). This was first realized in 1786, when Sir William Jones, a British judge in the High Court at Kolkata and one of the pioneer Sanskritists noted that there are striking similarities in the vocabulary of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Celtic and Gothic languages. They had drawn these conclusions based on comparison of the numbers from 1 to 10 in different European languages to that of Sanskrit, something like this 👇👇 A particularly striking example of family resemblance between the various Indo-European languages is afforded by the word ‘MOTHER’, which has the following cognates: Initially, the historical explanations offered for the similarities between these words in the various so called Indo-European languages were rather unsophisticated and highly speculative. By the middle of the 19th century however, the idea that all Indo-European languages derive from a much older Proto-Indo European language gained considerable momentum. Scholars now sought to reconstruct not only that ancient proto language but also the culture associated with it. Max Müller in fact was amongst the first scholars to equate linguistic communities with ethnic and racial groups. He started the Aryan- Dravidian racial binary in India with his deliberate misinterpretation of the Vedic term Dasa. Later, horrified with the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe, he retracted and said that the Aryans and Semitics were linguistic and not ethnic labels. The simple fact is that the British Colonial Administration had an agenda, inorder to justify their invasion on India they created a mythical racial theory called “Aryan - Dravidian theory”. The commonalities b/w some words of the Indo-European group of language and the quest for an Aryan Homeland led them to postulate the racial construct of an Aryan invasion from Central Europe that destroyed the so called the original Dravidian civilisation. Their intent was to prove that if the Hindus themselves were invaders, what right did they have to whine about British & Islamic invasion and colonization of native lands? They were as much foreigners to India as the British colonizers were . The facts however are simple and straightforward, they say there is a marked similarity between the so called Indo-European group of languages. I want to ask what explains this similarity? What are its implications? What was the original nature of this so called proto Indo-European language? Were the so called Aryans foreign invaders or immigrants? Or were they indigenous? I would say it is very much possible that the Indo-Aryans were native and indigenous people of the Indus-Sarasvati tract and it was a case of out- migration rather than in-migration. Also there is such an amazing degree of cultural continuity between the Harappan civilisation and modern day Hindu practices in all parts of India. Historiography is all about new interpretations that emerge from an analysis of subsequent data. Did the Aryans move into India from a mythical Aryan Homeland in Central Europe or Anatolia or did they migrate outwards from the desiccated and desertified Indus-Sarasvati plains in search of new sources of fresh drinking water for their very survival.? The linguistic similarity between India, Iran & Central Europe is due to the migration of IVC people from Harappa to the different parts of the world. It has been a proven fact that 75% of the IVC or Harappan sites lie along the banks of dried river Saraswati. At the time of Mahabharat war, when Lord Krishna’s elder brother Balaram was on his pilgrimage he noticed the drying course of river Saraswati. During the peak of Harappan civilization, the mother river Saraswati has been reduced to a string of pools in the North and beyond Rajasthan it has vanished beneath the surface of earth. A whole civilisation was slowly dying and the creeping desert sands have forced the people to move out . The migration started towards Northwards first and then both Eastwards into the Ganga-Yamuna plains and then Westwards towards the Helmand River in Afghanistan, to Iran, to Central Asia (to the Syr and Amu daryas), to Mesopotamia and beyond—possibly even to Eastern and Southern Europe. Now the fake indologists come up with an argument “Sarasvati is a mythical river” But, ISRO finds the traces of Saraswati river [LINKED_TEXT: Mythical Saraswati River] [URL: https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=94098] [LINKED_TEXT: ISRO's findings should put an end to the myth of the Saraswati river being a 'myth'] [URL: https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/isros-findings-should-put-an-end-to-the-myth-of-the-saraswati-river-being-a-myth/] According to the statement released by the ISRO official, the Remote Sensing Satellites of ISRO have traced the remains of Saraswati river & studied it’s paleochanels & subsequently drawn the paleochannel map of Saraswati river. According to Anil Kumar Gupta, former Scientist at ISRO, the remote sensing satellites traced the inactive Saraswati river basin and concluded that the river was flown abudantly during the period 10,000BCE - 8000 BCE and completely dried up by 2500 BCE. The drying of Saraswati river is what led the Harappans to move out from India to west, probabaly to mesapatomia, anatolia or beyond. This is from his research paper While explaining so ,ISRO Scientist Anil Kumar Gupta stated that the Harappan civilization thrived at the banks of the Saraswati river and around 2500 BCE this river dried up due to climatic changes and earthquakes. The decline of Harappan civilization was due to change in Monsoons & Earthquakes. [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354411502_Impact_of_Indian_Summer_Monsoon_Change_on_Ancient_Indian_Civilizations_During_the_Holocene] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354411502_Impact_of_Indian_Summer_Monsoon_Change_on_Ancient_Indian_Civilizations_During_the_Holocene]The above research paper explains that the decline of Harappan civilization was due to decline in the Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM). Due to the decline in the monsoons & drying of Saraswati river, the Harappans started migrating to different places. Some towards west (Europe) & some towards Indo-Gangetic plains. Now the next argument from fake Indologists is, Saraswati river mentioned in Vedas is Helmand river in Afghanistan or Amu- Darya river. My response :- The Rigveda describes Saraswati river joins into the sea whereas the Helmand river don’t join into sea, it terminates in a landlocked country. So Helmand river is not Saraswati Moving on, The following table from a scientific research paper gives the data regarding the distribution of R1a DNA in Indian Sub-Continent & Europe. According to the data collected, the India’s R1a DNA is much older than that of Europe with higher variance suggesting that the yDNA R1a travalled from India to Europe (probably from Harappa region to Europe). This shall prove that the migration happened from the Indian Sub-Continent to the Iran & Europe. The Harappan people who migrated to those places (Europe & Iran) might have introdued their language & culture to the native people and that language is Sanskrit. This is why you find Matru in Sanskrit has become Mother in English & Mutter in German. That would logically explain the commonality of Indo-European languages. The proto Indo-European language would then be Sanskrit and the protocivilisational area of the Aryans could well be the Indus- Sarasvati tract. Jai Hind !

It all starts with bare rock. The formation could be brand new rock from a volcanic eruption. Or it could be rock newly exposed by a landslide, lowered water levels, or uplifted during an earthquake. Not important. Many things act upon it now that it is in the open. Physical weather is simply how the big solid rock breaks into smaller pieces. Changes in temperature, alternating freezing and warming cause cracks and flaking. Wind and water pound the rock, breaking off bits and pieces. The same processes that cause potholes in our highways gradually crumble exposed rock to pieces. Water fills tiny cracks, freezes and expands, enlarging the spaces. Plant roots may grow into them, and, over time, grow bigger and accomplish the same thing. Even animals walking on bare rock scrape and chip off pieces. Chemical weathering are the changes in the rock’s composition caused by substances in rainwater (including acid rain), in groundwater (including secretions from plant roots), and in the air. The rock itself is softened and is more vulnerable to physical weathering. So, the rock surface gradually changes from the above and develops a powdery, softer surface. Lo and behold! Seeds and spores in the air land on the rock, and some of them grow. If the conditions are right (moisture, not too much sun for example), moss and lichen may find a good spot and start to grow. As they grow, their roots dig into the rock surface. They secrete carbolic acid and other substances that change the rock and cause it to deteriorate. As the powdered rock gets deeper, the lichens and mosses increase in number and size. After a while, there is enough ‘stuff’ (dead plant materials, perhaps dead critters, fecal material, etc.) that some seeds can actually sprout and grow. These would be very tiny plants at this point. The processes continue. The layer of material gradually deepens. This becomes the soil. Soil is a very complex and complicated mixture of mineral particles, decomposed organic matter from living organisms (microorganisms, plants, animals, etc.). As the soil layer increases over many years, larger and larger plants and animals become part of it, accelerating the soil formation. Eventually, it is deep enough to sustain the living things for that ecosystem. How fast does this happen? The standard rate in a temperate climate like the Mid-Atlantic states is about one inch in a century. If the rock is softer (granite is much harder than limestone), this process will be faster. If the climate is warmer, it happens more quickly. And if there is more water—wetter climate—that will speed the process a lot. Valleys/pockets build up soil more than slopes for obvious reasons. The types of living things also affect the processes as well."},{"instruction":"w hard is it to trace a VPN?","output":"VPN connections can be traced through various means, such as tracking the data packets sent and received, monitoring the DNS requests, analyzing the traffic patterns, or identifying the unique IP addresses of the [LINKED_TEXT: VPN] [URL: https://www.vpngenix.com/] servers."},{"instruction":"it wrong to give meaty names to meatfree foods?

(1) In 2010 the IMF lent Euro 30 billion to Greece as part of a much larger package to support the ailing economy. The IMF explained at the time that it had lent 3200% of quota, well over its normal limits for a country in difficulty. It gave Greece “exceptional access to IMF resources”. The IMF cited the need to prevent the crisis spreading to other parts of the EU and to defend the Euro. In 2012 the IMF decided to lend Greece a new Euro 28bn as part of a replacement loan package. It drew attention this time to a “significant large competitiveness gap” (stronger language than 2010) and to a high level of public debt. This time it agreed with a major write down of privately held Greek public sector debt (75% written off) and required cuts in the minimum wage as part of its measures to improve competitiveness. Once again Greece received special treatment with a large loan. I queried why the IMF would do this for a country which is no longer sovereign in monetary and economic matters, as its status with the Euro prevents a normal IMF recovery package. (2) The International Monetary Fund says Greece missed a 1.8 billion debt payment Tuesday, becoming the first developed country to default on a loan to the lending agency.Eurozone finance chiefs refused to grant a last-minute extension of the bailout program Greece has relied on for five years, and the Greek government couldn't come up with money on its own to pay the IMF. The IMF said its executive board would consider a Greek request to extend the loan. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called a referendum Sunday in which Greek voters can decide whether to approve a deal proposed by the country's creditors. A \\"No\\" vote would likely force Greece to stop using the euro currency. The last country to miss an IMF loan payment was Zimbabwe in 2001. (3) The IMF has been charging an effective interest rate of 3.6% on its loans to Greece. This is far more than the interest rate the institution needs to meet all its costs, currently around 0.9%. If this was the actual interest rate Greece had been paying the IMF since 2010, it would have spent €2.5 billion less on payments.Out of its lending to all countries in debt crisis between 2010 and 2014 the IMF has made a total profit of €8.4 billion, over a quarter of which is effectively from Greece. All of this money has been added to the Fund’s reserves, which now total €19 billion. These reserves would be used to meet the costs from a country defaulting on repayments. Greece’s total debt to the IMF is currently €24 billion.

Fail Gracefully In one of my “mommy” WhatsApp groups, recently we were having a discussion on how kids fail. It’s truly a test of resilience. See a 3–4 month old trying to roll over - The baby would try. If the attempt was successful - it would give a happy hoot. If not, it would try a few times and then go back to engaging in another activity. There we have a powerful lesson on how to handle failure.

The service will make it easier for operators, banks and even transit operators to link Visa payment accounts to consumers’ smartphones, the company says. Although perhaps not as exciting as news of a mobile wallet “app” in consumers’ eyes, what Visa is revealing is a key part of the underlying infrastructure that can make NFC-based mobile payments a reality. By allowing phones to be “switched on” for mobile payments through an over-the-air activation process, the process will become more seamless for users and service providers alike. However, because the system is NFC-based, it’s limited only to supported handsets which include an NFC chip. This is nowhere near the majority of smartphones today and does not include the Apple iPhone. In addition, while there appears to be growing consumer demand for mobile payments, it’s not clear whether consumers will take to NFC in large numbers. (Only analysts’ predictions on that front.)

Also to help prevent him from chewing random things make sure you have plenty of chew toys that are of different textures, shapes and sizes, that helps! Either put your bins in a cupboard or buy new bins with secure lids on so they can’t get into any bin and eat something poisonous or toxic. Basically look at your home and move harmful things out of reach and restrict areas if need be, do as you would if you have a human toddler in your home. If you have a mass of cable wires like behind your TV, use cable ties to safely bunch them together to prevent him getting behind there and getting tangled. If you allow your pup up on the sofa’s and beds, while his still small and if you can buy or make your own doggy ramp or steps (pictured below), so many puppies break there legs jumping off these things and it’s the one thing new puppy owners forget to consider! Speaking as a behaviourist try not to molly cuddle him to much, carry him around or constantly talk to him. Molly cuddling and carrying will cause him to develop behavioural problems as he grows and will make him a nightmare for you and you won’t get the enjoyment that your looking for (owners not taking this advice are the ones with the dogs that constantly go at other dogs and become aggressive if someone approaches it’s owner, plus other behavioural issues!).

Dark Phoenix Despite appearing in earnest in only one major story arc (her namesake Dark Phoenix Saga), the Dark Phoenix/Jean Grey was the central villain in what is, arguably, the most iconic X-Men story ever produced. Partially owing to Jean Grey's prior status as a heroine, and to her destruction of an entire galaxy, the Dark Phoenix remains one of the most shocking and effective villains of Marveldom. More recently, the Phoenix Force attempted to reunite with the younger, time-tossed Jean Grey - a story which resulted in the return of the older Jean, who banished the Phoenix from her life forever, with the younger Jean eventually returning to her original timeline. In the aftermath, the Pheonix has since returned to earth and is currently holding a tournament designed to find a new host. 9. Doctor Octopus Until fairly recently, the long-running but sometimes silly Dr. Octopus might have been considered a B-List villain at best, despite often functioning as Spider-Man's arch-enemy. Doc Ock proved his place as one of Spidey's top foes a few years ago by doing what almost no other villains in Marvel Comics have accomplished - he actually finished off his nemesis. Doc Ock's final scheme was transferring his consciousness into Peter Parker's body, trapping Peter's mind in Ock's own dying form. In this feat, he actually succeeded, going on to take over Peter's life, and his role as Spider-Man - the Superior Spider-Man, to be precise. Though Peter eventually defeated Dr. Octopus once and for all, and returned to his role as Spider-Man, many of the things Doc Ock did while under the mask are still affecting his life. In the years since, Otto Octavius has gone back and forth between his Doctor Octopus and Superior Spider-Man identities, waffling as well on whether he's got a heart of gold, or a sadistic streak that still won't quit. 8. Ultron Ultron may be on the back burner in current Marvel Comics, but for decades he has been one of the most violent, vicious foes of the Avengers and the Marvel Universe at large. A killer AI designed by Avenger Hank Pym before rebelling against his creator and mankind overall, Ultron is obsessed with ending organic life on Earth and destroying humanity in particular. Ultron was the main villain of Avengers: Age of Ultron, a film which took its name from the comic book story Age of Ultron in which Ultron conquers the world and alters the Marvel Universe timeline. Unkillable, indestructible, and always scheming somewhere in the background, it's only a matter of time before Ultron resurfaces again, more deadly and dangerous than before. 7. Green Goblin Norman Osborn has been a villain under many names - as the Green Goblin, the Iron Patriot, and of course under his real identity as the leader of the villainous organization HAMMER (a one-time replacement for SHIELD following the Secret Invasion story). But it's as the Green Goblin, one of the greatest foes of Spider-Man, that Norman built his greatest villainous reputation. Like many of Spidey's enemies, Osborn is obsessed with menacing the Wall-Crawler, even killing his girlfriend in the story 'The Death of Gwen Stacy,' an event that led to Osborn's own apparent death. But like the best bad guys, you can't keep ol' Normie down - he eventually resurfaced numerous times, with one of his latest schemes binding him with the Carnage symbiote to become the Red Goblin. And even after his defeat as Red Goblin, Norman returned as the Green Goblin, pushing Spider-Man so far he actually pushed Norman in turn - right out of an airplane. 6. Galactus Supposedly created when Jack Kirby and Stan Lee pondered what would happen if the Fantastic Four encountered God, the world-eating Galactus quickly became one of the greatest threats ever encountered in the Marvel Universe, often uniting various heroes and even villains when his boundless hunger draws him to the lifeforce rich Earth. More of a force of nature than a villain in the scheming and plotting sense, Galactus nevertheless constitutes one of the weirdest and most dire threats throughout the Marvel Universe, striking terror into every world on which he casts his shadow. Still, even Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, who have faced down Galactus more than anyone, recognizes that Galactus's world-destroying nature is part of the order of the universe, choosing to help guide his terrible hunger rather than try to destroy him. 5. Magneto One of Marvel's most compelling characters almost since his debut in 1963's Uncanny X-Men #1, Magneto has often straddled the line between hero and villain, operating on a morality wholly separate from the usual supervillain dynamic. And in recent years, Magneto has firmly planted himself alongside the X-Men and the rest of mutantkind on the sovereign mutant nation of Krakoa, solidifying his transition away from being a full-on 'bad guy.' But Magneto's Marvel Universe legacy in comic books and other media like movies (where Magneto was a main character in most of the now defunct Fox X-Men franchise), is as a villain - and not just a villain, but one of the premiere menaces of Marveldom, even when his motivations, like preserving mutantkind from extinction, are sympathetic. 4. Loki For many years, Loki was almost the primary villain of the Marvel universe, menacing not just his brother the mighty Thor, but many of Marvel's other big names, even leading to the formation of the Avengers. It is, therefore, appropriate that he also took that role in the Marvel cinematic universe, a turn that made Tom Hiddleston a star, and made Loki almost more popular among some fans than the heroes he opposes. These days, in comic books, Loki is one of many popular villains who has moved into being more of an antihero, or even out and out superhero, repositioning himself not as the god of lies, but as the god of stories. In the MCU, Hiddleston's Loki is about to be a true leading man for the first time in an eponymous Disney Plus streaming show that follows up his timeline-warping escape with the Tesseract in Avengers: Endgame. 3. Red Skull By far the oldest villain on this list, the Red Skull is emblematic of far too many aspects of villainy to list. Never wavering from the Nazi ideals he has espoused since World War II was still being waged, the Red Skull is the absolute counterpoint to Captain America, Marvel's moral center, and provides just about everybody someone to hate. Red Skull’s biggest moment in recent memory came when he instigated Captain America's turn to Hydra (thanks to a Cosmic Cube and some time travel), which culminated in the Secret Empire event in which Steve, as a Hydra dictator, conquered the United States before the 'real' Steve reappeared and saved the day. Red Skull perished as a result of his own manipulation in Secret Empire, but he's about to return in the finale of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates' Captain America run. 2. Doctor Doom Though his profile has waned somewhat in recent years thanks to a turn as a reluctant hero, the fan favorite Dr. Doom has returned to villainy in the recent Fantastic Four relaunch, resuming his rightful place in the hierarchy of Marvel's villainous pyramid. Doom is the smartest man in the Marvel Universe - yes, even smarter than his hated enemy Reed Richards - but like all great villains, his hubris blinds him to his own potential. Not content with mastering only science, Doom is also one of the most powerful magic users in the Marvel Universe, and was once considered a rival to Dr. Strange for the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Despite never having received a proper film adaptation in three movie appearances and two separate franchises, Dr. Doom remains a presence in the cultural zeitgeist, his very name synonymous with villainy even to those who don't read comic books. 1. Thanos Before catching the briefest glimpse of Thanos in the end credits of the Avengers film, most mainstream audiences probably hadn't even heard of the mad titan. But longtime Marvel readers know him as the cosmic bad-ass who possessed the reality-altering Infinity Gauntlet, and who slew half the universe, including many Marvel heroes, before his misdeeds were undone. Now, thanks to his starring role in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, Thanos is not just seen as Marvel's biggest villain but he's a household name in his own right - even recreating his cosmically catastrophic Infinity Gauntlet 'snap' to murder half the Marvel Cinematic Universe, just as he did in Marvel Comics."},{"instruction":"What are the best features of the new OnePlus TV Y1S?","output":"There is a long list of specs in this Oneplus y1s tv that a user definitely going to like.

This is like the worst experience for me. I work at a company which is a small company of 20 people with 2 offices. I the office where I work there are 15 people. Some are part time and some full time. A new part time hire joined the company last year. Since I am working at the company for long time, so I have collected various equipments over time. Because they order equipments only during certain months when they have excess budget. But by equipments I mean one monitor and office laptop! The other employees at the office already have two monitors and laptops! The new hires take time to get equipments because again the new equipments are ordered only in certain months of budget. So he starts stealing my monitor and complaining that brown bitch ( I was the only foreigner) doesn't deserve to have any stuff more than him! He keeps complaining that I am stealing others monitors and misusing the meeting rooms. And he isn't able to sleep because of me! And the worst part, another employee decided to join him and bitch about me all the time. The next time I went to use the meeting room for a meeting call, the manager came to check me inside the room! So I finally decided it's better to work from home instead of working with such colleagues. The best thing about the lockdown is that the manager s are comfortable with letting employees work from home or remotely.

It’s a small arrow-shaped icon next to the battery. If the icon is filled in, it means the current app (on the screen) is actively using your location. If the icon is hollow, it means geofencing is active (which could be in background app). Geofencing doesn’t allow the app to track your location in detail: rather, it notifies the app if your phone enters or leaves a certain predefined location. For example, home automation apps that turn on your lights when you get home might use this by setting a geofence for “home”. If a background app is really actively using your location (for example, a maps app for active navigation) iOS makes it super clear that this is going on. The notification area grows to double height and the name of the app is shown: You can also control which apps have access to your location using Location Services in Privacy in the Settings app. You can control settings for each app individually. You can also see an explanation for why the app needs location services. Even better, you can see which apps have used location services recently.

We develop Windows-based software in c++ and C#, and we use Visual Studio as our IDE. I use a combination of a screen reader and a braille display. While a braille display isn't strictly necessary, I find that it makes things easier since I can see the indentation and read the spelling of a function name or variable without moving the cursor over to it to hear it spelled out. Of course, the autocomplete feature makes memorizing the exact name and spelling of function and variable names unnecessary. But being able to see the indentation in braille makes moving line by line through the code blocks much quicker than it would be without the braille display. There are parts of the Visual Studio IDE which aren't accessible, but the parts which we use obviously are. All of the parts of the Visual Studio IDE which render actual text rather than just graphics are accessible. The screen reader is also able to detect the placement of breakpoints, and will announce the breakpoint along with the line when the cursor is moved to it. The IDE has functionality by which you can move the cursor to the start of any function in the open file. It also can move to a function or variable definition or declaration, which makes it as easy for blind people to jump to these points of interest as it is for sighted people.

However, there have been several events that have weakened the Borg's power and influence, making them less of a threat than they were in the past. One of the key events that weakened the Borg was the destruction of the Borg Queen in the movie Star Trek: First Contact. This disrupted the Borg's collective consciousness and made it more difficult for them to coordinate their efforts effectively. Additionally, the Voyager crew was able to disrupt the Borg's transwarp network, making it more difficult for them to travel long distances quickly. Another factor that has contributed to the Borg's decline is that they have been forced to adapt to the tactics and strategies used against them by Starfleet and other species. The Borg have always been highly adaptable, but as they have encountered more species with unique technologies and strategies, they have been forced to modify their own tactics, which has made them somewhat less effective. Despite these setbacks, the Borg are still considered a formidable adversary and a threat to the Federation and other species in the Star Trek universe."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],P={key:0},U={key:1};function H(a,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(o(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,y)=>(o(),k(p,{key:y,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),i("div",B,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
