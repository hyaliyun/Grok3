Boeing and SpaceX were awarded contracts worth up to 6.8 billion to build the spacecraft, with the hope of starting launches in 2017. However, this timeline has been pushed back due to a range of technical, safety and budgetary concerns. Sierra Nevada Corp was one of the losing bidders for the Commercial Crew Program contracts, with their Dream Chaser spacecraft failing to make the final cut.

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. Question: Do meanders cause oxbow lakes?

During the Portuguese Colonial War, which lasted from 1961 to 1974, there were actually more soldiers than civilians within the Portuguese force. This was due to the nature of the conflict, which involved Portugal using its military to retain control over its colonies in Africa. The war began in Angola in 1961, and the Portuguese government quickly mobilized its military to combat the independence movements that had arisen in the colonies of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. At the peak of the conflict, there were over 200,000 Portuguese soldiers deployed in Africa. While civilians were also present in the war zone, they were generally limited to colonial administrators, settlers, and their families. The vast majority of the Portuguese civilians in Africa did not take an active role in the fighting, and instead relied on the military to protect them from attacks by independence fighters. Overall, the Portuguese force during the Colonial War was heavily comprised of soldiers, rather than civilians. Despite this, the conflict had a significant impact on both military personnel and civilians, with many lives lost and lasting repercussions for both Portugal and its former colonies."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = cheap, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area.

In response to the challenge, chocolate manufacturers are finding innovative ways to meet the changing needs of consumers. Some are focusing on offering healthier options, such as dark chocolate, while others are turning to e-commerce to reach a wider audience and boost their sales.

The root cause of the insurgency in the region is the Baloch nationalist movement, which seeks greater autonomy for the province. Militant groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Balochistan Republican Army (BRA), have been involved in violence against the Pakistani military and state for years. These groups use tactics like bomb blasts, targeted killings, and attacks on security forces to assert their demands. The situation in Balochistan is further complicated by sectarian violence. The province has a sizable Shia population, and attacks on them by Sunni extremist groups have been on the rise in recent years. This has resulted in a cycle of violence that has become increasingly difficult to break. Moreover, the militants in Balochistan are known for their attacks on political rallies, and during the recent national elections in Pakistan, militant groups targeted voters. This led to a low voter turnout in the province and has further destabilized the region. The Pakistani government has tried several approaches to address the issues in Balochistan over the years, including military operations, negotiations, and development projects. However, none of these initiatives have been fully successful in quelling the violence and unrest. The instability in Balochistan has severe consequences for the region and beyond. The area is strategically important due to its location, and instability in Balochistan can have negative implications for neighboring countries like Afghanistan and Iran. In conclusion, the situation in Balochistan is complex and multifaceted, and addressing the issues there requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of the conflict. The government of Pakistan needs to find a lasting solution to the conflict for the wellbeing of the people of Balochistan and the region as a whole."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following: A drop down menu should appear with a variety of options.

I would have given the Wynn Buffet five stars a few years ago. My husband and I just ate here recently. I wanted to introduce him to Wynn Buffet for the first time because it was supposed to be the epitome of gluttony. After all that's why it's the most expensive buffet in town. But instead of spoiling our stomachs for lunch, I was very disappointed at how much the buffet has really gone downhill. They really cut back on their selection of entrees and dessert. The last time I ate here, my stomach wasn't big enough to devour samples of all the delicious food that they served. This time I didn't even have an appetite. Nothing stood out. Nothing was memorable. There was very little to choose. This was such a letdown because I wanted my husband to be impressed by this buffet. Needless to say it wasn't worth the price. It was just a mediocre buffet, and we don't plan on ever coming back. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. Even one of my friends who used to love this buffet thought it sucked.

The team started the season with high hopes, but unfortunately, they failed to maintain their winning streak throughout the entire season. As a result, they lost some matches and drew others, leaving them with fewer points than their competitors. To answer the question, \\"How many points did the PSV lose by?\\" we need to look at their final standing in the league. At the end of the season, PSV finished in second place on the league table, behind Ajax Amsterdam. They had a total of 64 points, which was 16 points fewer than the champions, Ajax. In the 34 matches played during the season, PSV won 20 matches, drew four, and lost ten games. Of the 68 goals they scored, Donyell Malen was their top scorer with 19 goals. PSV's defense let in 35 goals, which was better than most of the other teams in the league. Overall, the team's performance was decent, but they had a few disappointing results that cost them valuable points. For example, they lost 2-0 to Vitesse Arnhem, drew 1-1 with FC Twente, and lost 3-1 to AZ Alkmaar. These results were unexpected and prevented PSV from challenging Ajax for the championship. In conclusion, PSV lost by 16 points to Ajax in the 2020/2021 Eredivisie season. Despite finishing second on the table, they need to improve on their performances to compete at the highest level in the future."},{"instruction":"Why do Indians think a lot about what others think?

Dempsey's kick was only 63 yards long, but it remains a legendary feat in the world of American football. Today, it is also recognized as one of the most impressive field goals in NFL history. Tom Dempsey's unprecedented kick came on the final play of the game and secured a 19-17 victory for the Saints. Dempsey's incredible feat was made all the more remarkable by the fact that he was born without toes on his right foot and without fingers on his right hand. Despite his physical limitations, he managed to develop a unique kicking style that maximized his potential and allowed him to make the most of his abilities. Over the years, many other kickers have attempted to break Dempsey's record, but none have succeeded. A few have come close, however. For example, in 2013, Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos kicked a record-breaking field goal of 64 yards. Today, field goals of 50 yards or more are quite common in professional football.

The Green Party's leader, Natalie Bennett, is no exception. Bennett has been particularly vocal about the importance of voting in this year's election, calling on all eligible voters to turn out and take part in the democratic process. In recent statements, Bennett has urged voters to cast their ballots \\"for what they believe in.\\" She has stressed the importance of choosing a party that aligns with their values and beliefs, rather than simply voting tactically or strategically. \\"Everyone should vote for the party that is closest to them, in terms of their values and priorities,\\" Bennett said. \\"Don't get swayed by scaremongering or media spin. Make your decision based on what you truly believe in.\\" Bennett went on to explain that, if voters cannot find a party that truly represents them on the ballot paper, they should still turn out and make their voices heard. \\"If there's no one on the ballot paper who you feel represents your views, then write a rude word,\\" she quipped. While some may dismiss this last statement as a flippant remark, it highlights a crucial aspect of the democratic process. Voting is not just about choosing a leader or party to represent us; it is also about expressing our dissatisfaction with the options provided to us. By turning out to vote, even if we do not feel fully represented, we send a message to the political establishment that they need to do better. We demand more options, better representation, and a more fair and just society. With just a few days left until the election, it is more important than ever for voters to take Bennett's message to heart. Don't sit on the sidelines or assume that your voice doesn't matter.

As a student, it is important to be aware of the rules and regulations surrounding this topic, as well as knowing how to navigate potentially tricky situations. One of the most important things to keep in mind is to know your professor's status. It is essential to make sure that your professor is not in a position of power over you, such as being your direct supervisor or having control over your grades. If a professor is in a position of power, it is best to avoid pursuing any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with them. It is also important to know your university's rules and policies regarding sexual harassment. Each institution has its own guidelines that should be adhered to. Be sure to familiarize yourself with these policies, as they can offer insight and guidance in case any issues arise. Another important aspect to consider is timing. It is best to wait until the semester is over before pursuing any kind of romantic or sexual relationship with a professor. This will ensure that there is no conflict of interest and that the student-teacher relationship is not compromised. When asking a professor out on a date, it is important to be direct and honest. It is best to ask them out in a respectful manner, and to be clear about your intentions. If they decline, it is important to respect their decision and not push the issue. Lastly, be mindful of the possibility of being \\"played.\\" It is important to remember that a professor-student relationship can be complicated and it is important to enter into any romantic or sexual relationship with caution.

Cristiano Ronaldo returns from injury to help inspire Spanish side. Bayern Munich dominate possession but cannot convert chances. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Real Madrid secured a vital victory against Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night. The Spanish side, led by Cristiano Ronaldo who returned from injury, managed to edge out the dominant German team 1-0, settling the match with a Frenchman Karim Benzema goal on the 19th minute. The defending champions, who are bidding for their third consecutive Champions League title and fourth in five years, were under pressure from the start. However, it was Real Madrid who took the lead after some quick thinking from Marcelo, whose cross found Benzema to head in from close range. Despite Bayern Munich's domination in possession, which reached 63%, they were unable to break down Real Madrid's defence. Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller both had early chances to equalize for Bayern but failed to put them on the scoresheet. Cristiano Ronaldo, after being sidelined in the league for three weeks, returned to the starting line-up, though he was unable to break the deadlock himself. Nevertheless, his presence on the pitch was enough to inspire his team-mates in keeping Bayern at bay. The second leg of the semi-final will be held at the Allianz Arena next week, and Bayern Munich will require a top performance in order to overturn the deficit. Real Madrid, on the other hand, will be looking to extend their lead and book their spot in yet another Champions League final."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Rice Boat, food = Fast food, priceRange = moderate, area = riverside, familyFriendly = no, near = Express by Holiday Inn.

If they still have the messages in their inbox, they can forward them to you. However, this method may not work if the recipients have also deleted the messages. Another way to retrieve your messages is to check your archived conversations on Facebook Messenger. Archived conversations are not deleted permanently and can be accessed by clicking on the \\"Archived Messages\\" option. If your conversations were sent to your email, you can retrieve them by checking your email's \\"Sent\\" folder.

Start by spreading a sheet or drop cloth around the fence to protect the surrounding area from any debris that may be created during the process. Next, it's important to protect yourself by putting on gloves, a dust mask and goggles. Removing paint and rust from the flat surfaces of the fence can be done with a metal scraper. Be sure to apply enough pressure to remove any loose paint or rust, but take care not to damage the underlying metal. When it comes to curved areas, a wire brush is both effective and safe. Using a circular motion, rub the brush against the surface until all loose paint and rust is removed. Once all loose debris has been removed, it's time to sand the fence. Choose a 150-grit sandpaper to create a smooth surface for painting. Working in the direction of the fence boards, use long, even strokes until the surface of the fence is clean and smooth. Before applying a new coat of paint, be sure to clean the fence of any remaining dust or debris. One way to do this is by rubbing the fence with mineral spirits.

The economic downturn has led to a decrease in the number of spectators in arenas, making it difficult for bullfighting to sustain as a profitable business. Additionally, animal-rights groups have held protests, citing the cruelty involved in bullfighting as their primary concern. The tradition of bullfighting involves a matador, or bullfighter, confronting and ultimately killing a bull in front of a large audience. This spectacle has been a prominent fixture of Spanish culture for centuries, but in recent years, there has been increasing scrutiny on the treatment of animals. Animal-rights groups have been active in protesting bullfighting, making use of social media and organizing demonstrations outside arenas. These groups argue that bullfighting is a cruel and inhumane practice, causing immense pain and suffering to the animals involved. Some regions in Spain have already taken action against bullfighting. In 2010, the region of Catalonia banned bullfighting, becoming the first area in Spain to do so. Now, the government of Catalonia is considering a vote to ban the activity entirely. This could have a significant impact on the future of bullfighting in Spain, as the region is one of the largest markets for the tradition. The economic impact of a complete ban on bullfighting cannot be ignored. Many jobs in Spain rely on the industry, including breeders, farmers, and workers in the arenas. However, supporters of animal rights argue that the ethical considerations should outweigh economic ones. In conclusion, the future of bullfighting in Spain is uncertain. While the tradition has a long and storied history, increasing opposition from animal-rights groups and the threat of bans from regional governments could spell the end of bullfighting in Spain as we know it. only time will tell how this tradition evolves in the years to come."},{"instruction":"Solve this math problem Solve 0 = 6442*z + 5137*z + 107010 for z.","output":"0 = -6442*z + 5137*z + 107010 can be simplified to: -1305*z + 107010 = 0 Therefore: -1305*z = -107010 z = 82"},{"instruction":"Write a question you would see in a school textbook.","output":"What is the scientific method and how is it used in research?"},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this Paint over small details with a thin brush.

Use water and a paper towel to fix any mistakes.","output":"When it comes to painting small details on figurines, having the right tools and techniques can make all the difference. One useful tip is to use a thin brush when painting over small details. This allows for greater precision and control over the brush strokes, and can help to avoid accidentally painting over adjacent areas. Another technique to consider is drybrushing. This involves applying a small amount of light-colored paint to the brush, then removing most of the paint by wiping it off on a tissue or paper towel. The lightly loaded brush can then be used to add highlights and texture to the figurine, giving it more depth and detail. For shading, a paint wash can be a great option. This involves mixing a small amount of paint with water to create a thin, watery consistency. The mixture can then be applied to certain sections of the figurine, such as crevices or recessed areas, to create shadows and contrast. The excess can be removed with a damp paper towel or cotton swab to achieve the desired effect. Finally, mistakes happen - but they don't have to ruin your work. If you make a mistake while painting, don't panic. Simply dip a clean brush in water and use it to lift the paint from the affected area. Use a paper towel to blot away any excess water and allow the area to dry before touching it up. Painting small details on figurines can be a challenging and rewarding process. By using the right techniques and tools, you can create a truly impressive finished product.

However, it can be daunting to initiate a conversation and form new relationships from scratch. Here are five ways to help break the ice and create lasting connections with others. 1. Small Talk in the Hallway Small talk is often overlooked, but it is essential to establish the foundation of a meaningful relationship. Take a moment to say hello, ask how someone is doing, or comment on the weather. This simple conversation can go a long way in building rapport, and it may lead to a more in-depth discussion. 2. Sit with Them at Lunch Having lunch with someone can be a great way to get to know them. Instead of sitting alone or with familiar faces, take the opportunity to join a new group. Engage in conversations and listen attentively to what others have to say. Doing so will not only help you build relationships with others, but it will also broaden your perspectives. 3. Offer to Have Everyone Over Hosting a gathering at your place can be an excellent way to connect with others. Invite colleagues or classmates to your home for a potluck or a game night. This gesture shows that you are willing to put in the effort to build relationships and that you care about creating a sense of community. 4. Show Them Your Sense of Humor Having a good sense of humor can make a world of difference in establishing connections with others. Humor can lighten the mood, create a shared experience, and break down any barriers or awkwardness. Find ways to inject a little levity into conversations, and don't be afraid to be yourself. 5. Embrace Differences Finally, it's essential to embrace differences when building relationships with others. We all have unique perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences that shape who we are. Take the time to understand and appreciate these differences, and be open to learning from them. Doing so will not only help you build more meaningful relationships but will also help you become a more empathetic and well-rounded person. In conclusion, building relationships with others takes time and effort, but it's worth it. By employing the five strategies outlined above - small talk in the hallway, sitting with them at lunch, offering to have everyone over, showing them your sense of humor, and embracing differences - you can make new connections that can enrich your life in so many ways."},{"instruction":"great burger one of the best i have had, but a little pricey for a fast foodish kind of place.. love the cool soda machine too !

Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

To begin, outline the model and color each organ in a different color to make it easy to identify each one. It's important to label each organ and provide a brief description of its function to fully understand how the body works. Starting with the brain, it controls all of the body's functions and is responsible for thoughts, movements and sensations. The heart pumps blood throughout the body and delivers oxygen to the organs. The lungs bring oxygen into the body and remove carbon dioxide. The kidneys filter the blood and remove waste products from the body. The liver is responsible for filtering toxins out of the blood and producing bile to help break down food. Moving onto the digestive system, the stomach is responsible for breaking down food and mixing it with stomach acids. The small intestine absorbs the nutrients from the food and sends them to the bloodstream. The large intestine absorbs water from the remaining waste products, forming feces. The pancreas secretes enzymes and hormones needed for digestion and regulates blood sugar levels. The reproductive system in females includes the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina. The uterus is where the embryo grows during pregnancy. The ovaries produce eggs for fertilization. The fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus. The vagina is the external opening of the female reproductive system. In males, the reproductive system includes the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and penis. The testes produce sperm, which is stored in the epididymis until ejaculation. The vas deferens carries the sperm to the urethra, which passes through the prostate gland and seminal vesicles before exiting the body through the penis. Overall, creating a model of the human body is a great way to learn about the different organs and their functions. By outlining the model, coloring each organ, labelling them, and writing a brief description of their function, it's easy to understand how the body works and how each organ plays a role in keeping us healthy."},{"instruction":"Read this: Washington University supports four major studentrun media outlets.

Try the journaling time out trick.","output":"Time-out During a Meltdown: A Helpful Technique for Parents Parenting can be both rewarding and challenging at the same time. While it’s fulfilling to watch your child grow and develop, there are moments when you might encounter a situation that makes you feel helpless. One such situation is when your child has a meltdown due to frustration, anger, or fatigue. Meltdowns can be difficult to manage and can often escalate if not handled properly. However, there is an effective technique that you can use to help your child calm down during a meltdown: time-out. What is Time-Out? Time-out is a technique commonly used by parents to discipline their children. It involves putting a child in a quiet and safe place for a few minutes to calm down and reflect on their behavior. The aim is to remove the child from the situation causing the meltdown and give them a chance to cool down. How to Use Time-Out During a Meltdown? When your child has a meltdown, it’s essential to use time-out to help them calm down. Here are five simple steps to follow when using time-out during a meltdown: Step 1: Communicate with Your Child When you notice the signs of a meltdown, calmly communicate with your child. Let them know that they are exhibiting behavior that is not acceptable and that they need to calm down. Step 2: Use Words Like “Time-Out” or “Quiet Time” Using words like “time-out” or “quiet time” sets the tone for your child to understand that they need to take a break from the situation causing the meltdown. Step 3: Place Them in a Safe Spot Select a safe place for your child to calm down. This could be a quiet corner of the room or their room. Ensure that there are no distractions or other people around. Step 4: Explain That You Will Talk to Them When They Calm Down Once your child is in a safe place, explain to them that you will talk to them once they have calmed down. This will help your child understand that their behavior has consequences and that they need to take responsibility for it. Step 5: Have a Talk When It's Time Once your child has calmed down, engage them in a conversation about their behavior. This is an excellent opportunity to help your child understand what triggered the meltdown and how they can better manage their emotions in the future. Be Consistent Consistency is key when using time-out with your child. Ensure that you use the technique every time your child has a meltdown. This will help your child understand that their behavior is not acceptable and that there are consequences. Try the Journaling Time-Out Trick Another effective technique you can use during a time-out is journaling. Encourage your child to write down their emotions and thoughts during the time-out. This will help them reflect on their behavior and gain a better understanding of their emotions. In conclusion, time-out is an effective technique that parents can use to help their children calm down during a meltdown. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can help your child manage their emotions and reduce the likelihood of future meltdowns. Remember to be consistent and try the journaling time-out trick for added effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Will: Hey, Maggie, could you give me a hand? Maggie: Hey, Will, sure.

The nitrogen content of plant tissues averages about 2%, while in fungi, animals, and bacteria it averages about 5% to 10%. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize. All animals' diets must provide sufficient amounts of the basic building blocks they need, up to the point where their particular biology can synthesize the rest. Animal tissue contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates (sugar, starch, and fiber), amino acids (in proteins), fatty acids (in lipids), and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).

Over time, you may notice that certain elements or characters surface repeatedly, giving you insight into your innermost desires, fears, and concerns. But dreams are not the only way to access your subconscious. Pay attention to the world around you. Observe the people, places, and things that catch your attention. Consider what they represent to you or what emotions they evoke. Take note of the details that stand out, such as colors, sounds, or smells. By taking this approach, you can tap into your intuition and learn more about your preferences and values. Of course, none of this matters if you cannot fall asleep in the first place. Establishing a soothing bedtime routine can help you relax and drift off. This may involve shutting down electronics an hour before bed, reading a book, taking a warm bath, or simply meditating. Experiment with different strategies until you find what works best for you. Once you have entered the dream realm, you may wish to conjure up a specific person or scenario. Some people may choose to focus on a crush or romantic partner. Visualization techniques may be helpful here, such as imagining yourself talking to your crush or going on a dream date. However, be mindful that dreams are not always rooted in reality, and your crush may not materialize in the way you expect! Ultimately, keeping a dream journal and paying attention to your inner and outer worlds can be beneficial for personal growth and self-awareness. By exploring your subconscious, you may discover new insights about yourself and your relationships. So, the next time you feel lost or confused, try taking a closer look at your dreams and your surroundings—not to mention your crush!"},{"instruction":"Read this: Holy Cross Father John Francis O'Hara was elected vicepresident in 1933 and president of Notre Dame in 1934.

Also, if you've traveled to Latin America recently, it's essential to get tested for Chagas since the disease is prevalent in these areas.

What we know is that Janikowski played for the Oakland Raiders for 18 seasons, and he made 414 field goals in total during that time, which makes him the all-time leading scorer for the Raiders. But when it comes to his field goal performance in the opening quarter of games, there is no publicly available data for us to cite. It is possible that such information exists within the archives of the NFL or the Raiders organization, but without access to those archives, we cannot give a definitive answer. In summary, there is no clear answer to the question of how many field goals Sebastian Janikowski made in the opening quarter of games. While we can appreciate his incredible talent and legacy as a kicker, specific statistics from a particular quarter require more research and data than is currently available."},{"instruction":"f uhhuh i love that book though i thought it was great, can we conclude that That was a great book because it hated on Trump?

Presidents often use war time photoops. Photographers took pictures of Obama huddling with health advisers Monday. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"The importance of presidential photo-ops cannot be understated. In times of war, these images serve to show strength and resolve. In times of crisis, they communicate a sense of leadership and determination. And in ordinary times, they offer a window into the daily activities of the most powerful person in the world. Recently, the current president has been holding more photo-ops as his administration seeks to demonstrate his commitment to his duties. From meeting with world leaders to touring disaster areas, he has been eager to show the American people that he is hard at work and focused on the job at hand. Interestingly, presidents have long relied on photo-ops to bolster their image during times of war. From Franklin D. Roosevelt visiting soldiers during World War II, to George W. Bush standing on the rubble of the World Trade Center after 9/11, these images serve as powerful symbols of leadership and strength. And yet, photo-ops can also be used to communicate more everyday concerns. For example, President Obama was recently photographed huddling with health advisers, discussing the ongoing pandemic. While this might not be a moment of crisis on the same scale as a war or terrorist attack, it still underscores the importance of competent leadership in times of need. Ultimately, presidential photo-ops are a crucial part of political communication. They offer an inside glimpse into the workings of the White House, while also shaping public perception of the leader. Whether they are used to demonstrate strength, resolve, or simply to show that the president is hard at work, these images will continue to play a vital role in American politics."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Kris: but it's becoming real now, leaving this place Herbert: Thats good.

If you are looking to start your own garden, one important step is to ensure proper seed placement. This can be achieved by creating “drills” in the soil with a hoe. These drills will provide a straight and even line for planting your seeds. After you have created your drills, it’s important to water along the length of the seedbed to ensure proper moisture. This will allow your seeds to germinate and develop properly. Once your soil is properly moistened, it’s time to plant your seedlings just barely into the soil along the drill/row. Be sure to follow the seed packaging instructions for the proper planting depth and spacing. As your seedlings start to grow, it’s important to thin them out. Thinning is the process of removing the weaker seedlings, allowing the stronger ones to grow and develop into healthy plants. This will also help prevent overcrowding which can lead to stunted growth or even death of your plants. In conclusion, starting a garden can be a rewarding experience, but it requires careful attention to detail. Creating “drills” in the soil with a hoe, watering along the length of the seedbed, and proper seedling placement will all help ensure the success of your garden. Additionally, thinning out your seedlings will allow for stronger, healthier plants.

This is especially evident in places where amelioration of the conditions of the populace need urgent redress. In those cases, the temptation to turn to violence and rebellion often lingers just below the surface. One such instance occurred in a recent event where it was expected that insurgents would join forces with the armed soldiers and seize power in the capital of a nation. This particular situation was born out of a severe sense of frustration and indignation felt by the people against the government for its ineptitude in addressing problems that have plagued the country for decades. As the situation developed, the anger and frustration boiled over, and the call for rebellion became a steadfast cause. It was believed in certain circles that this uprising would be supported by soldiers and the military, providing the coup with the force it required to succeed. However, as events unfolded, it became apparent that the military was divided, and the closeness of the insurgency with some of the soldiers was only conjecture. The lack of critical momentum and resources meant that the coup quickly lost energy and eventually died out. This situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of allowing emotions to drive us to take action without proper planning, consensus, and resources. It is essential to carefully consider the practicality, feasibility, and potential consequences of any movement before undertaking it. In an ideal world, grievances and discontent should be tackled through peaceful means like dialogue, diplomacy, and reform. However, when necessary, we must also be ready to take concerted, well-organized, and strategic action for the change that we want to see."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Midwives failed to spot Imogen Skelcher's dangerously low heart rate.

Begin the performance review by setting an objective. This objective should be clearly communicated to the employee to ensure that both parties are on the same page. It can give direction and focus to the rest of the review. When reviewing feedback, highlight positive feedback initially. This way, the receiver can feel affirmed and appreciated for their strengths. It is essential to provide specific examples of what they have done well, so they know what to continue doing. You can also use this opportunity to further encourage positive behavior in the future. After giving positive feedback, it is equally important to provide constructive criticism. Rather than merely pointing out areas that need improvement, provide specific examples of what could have been done differently. It is essential to focus on the behavior, not the person, to make sure the conversation remains constructive. Once you have addressed the existing issues, it is time to set performance objectives for the next evaluation period. These objectives should align with the company’s objectives and outline what the employee can do to improve their performance.

Report fraud.","output":"When buying a new or used vehicle, it's crucial to verify the authenticity of the vehicle identification number (VIN). The VIN is a unique code assigned to every vehicle that serves as its fingerprint. By inspecting the VIN, one can find out important information about the car’s history, including its manufacturer, model, and any accidental history. However, some dishonest sellers may try to tamper with the VIN to cover up a car’s faults or to falsify information. To avoid falling for such fraud, it's important to examine the VIN carefully and ensure that it hasn't been tampered with. One useful tool for this purpose is the VINCheck website, which allows car buyers to enter the VIN and check it against information from various databases to ensure its validity. The site can help buyers avoid unknowingly purchasing a stolen or salvaged vehicle or a car with a tampered VIN. If you suspect that a VIN has been tampered with, it's essential to report it immediately to the relevant authorities. This can help prevent criminals from using altered VINs to commit more automobile-related fraud. In conclusion, verifying the accuracy of a vehicle identification number is an important step in buying a vehicle. With the help of the VINCheck website and thorough inspection of the VIN, car buyers can make informed decisions and avoid potential fraudulent schemes."},{"instruction":"• saas delivery model for all sdl products, available now, with continuous enhancements quarterly throughout 2014.

Sex with an adult who is related as parent (including adoptive parent), grandparent, child (including adopted child), grandchild, brother, sister, halfbrother, halfsister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, is illegal. In England and Wales the offence is against the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which effectively replaced the offence of incest with two new wider groups of offences: familial child sex offences (sections 2529) and sex with an adult relative (sections 6465). These laws are intended to protect the rights of people, so as to avoid potential violation. However, these laws still outlaw consensual sexual relationships between family members, even if they are fully willing and knowledgeable to the potential consequences. There has been some debate surrounding the rhetoric used by the Sexual Offences Review Team.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Much of the early paper made from wood pulp contained significant amounts of alum, a variety of aluminium sulfate salts that is significantly acidic. Alum was added to paper to assist in sizing, making it somewhat water resistant so that inks did not run or spread uncontrollably. Early papermakers did not realize that the alum they added liberally to cure almost every problem encountered in making their product would eventually be detrimental. The cellulose fibres that make up paper are hydrolyzed by acid, and the presence of alum would eventually degrade the fibres until the paper disintegrated in a process that has come to be known as slow fire.

It is a slow moving film set like an episode of Wonder Years, with appalling lack of depth though. It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner. The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty. According to the makers of this movie, 'beauty' can be only experienced in BobRossstyle kitschy landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (like, primary school level) color theory and lots of sentiment. In parts the movie is offending, e.g. at a point it is stated (rather, celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' (quote).

From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, SerboCroatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called SerboCroatoSlovenian), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard.

This, in turn, helps us develop a sense of gratitude and a deeper connection with others, which can boost our self-esteem. Another way to boost self-belief is by sharing our passions with the people around us. Passion is contagious, and it inspires others to pursue their dreams. By sharing our passions, we also attract like-minded individuals who can offer support, encouragement, and collaboration. This reinforces a sense of purpose and confidence in our abilities. Spending time with people who are genuine and who support the true you is crucial to building self-belief. These people help us feel valued and supported, and they provide a safe space for us to be ourselves. Having a strong support system helps us navigate the challenges and setbacks that come with pursuing our dreams. Lastly, offering a warm smile to the people we see every day can go a long way in boosting self-belief.

One apparent exception was Muhayyelât (Fancies) by Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867.

The company is reducing the production from 300,000 a day down to 150,000 due to weaker demands for the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max models. Prices have also started dropping in the region, especially for the plastic phone. The company has remained tight-lipped about the cutback. However, an inside source admitted the drop in production to a Chinese technology site. Earlier, Nikkei Asian Review also reported that Apple was reducing the production of its latest iPhone models. The decline in demand for the new models is being attributed to various factors, including high prices, intense competition, and lack of significant updates. The new iPhone XR and XS models reportedly did not offer anything new and innovative compared to last year's models. It, therefore, failed to lure a significant number of customers who already had iPhones with functional components. Moreover, young customers in emerging markets like China and India prefer smartphones from local companies that offer the latest features at competitive prices. Chinese companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo have stolen a significant chunk of Apple's market share in Asia, specifically in China. Several analysts have predicted that Apple's struggles to find buyers for the latest iPhone models will continue. The company may invest more in technological advancements like Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality in its next generation of products. In conclusion, Apple's decision to reduce iPhone production by 50% can be seen as a clear reflection of the current trends in the market. The drop in demand for the latest models and increasing competition is putting significant pressure on the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant to adopt new strategies for sustained growth."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Binignit INGREDIENT Sweet potato; Binignit REGION Visayas; Binignit MAIN_INGREDIENTS Sago; Binignit COUNTRY Philippine","output":"Binignit is a dish from the Philippines, specifically from the Visayas region, made with sweet potato as its main ingredient and sago as one of its key components."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Create a will to distribute your estate assets to whomever you desire.

It is a crucial document that should not be skipped, irrespective of how much wealth you have. Creating a will helps you distribute your estate assets to whomever you want - this could be your family members, your favorite charity, or your closest friends. Here are several steps that can help you create a comprehensive will that meets your needs. Select an Executor The executor is the person responsible for ensuring that your wishes are carried out according to the terms of your will. The executor is usually a trusted family member or friend, but you can also choose a professional executor, such as a lawyer or an accountant. Name Guardians for Minor Children If you have children under the age of 18, it is vital to name a guardian who will take care of them if you pass away. This may be someone other than your spouse, or it could be a backup guardian in case the primary guardian is unavailable. Create an Inventory of Your Estate Your estate includes all your assets and debts. You should create an inventory of your estate to ensure that all your assets are accounted for and legally distributed to the beneficiaries you name in your will. Decide How to Pass Down Your Assets In most cases, you will want to pass down your assets to your family members. However, you should consider whether you want to give a portion to charity or your favorite organization. Specify How Your Heirs Will Pay Off Your Debts Your heirs may be responsible for paying off your debts after you pass away. You should indicate how you want them to pay off these debts in your will. Create a Backup Plan Creating a backup plan is essential as it ensures that your wishes are met if your primary beneficiaries pass away before you do. You should name one or two backup beneficiaries to ensure that your legacy is carried on. Check Your Retirement Account Beneficiaries When you pass away, your retirement accounts will automatically pass to your designated beneficiaries, irrespective of what your will stipulates. Ensure that you check the beneficiary list of your retirement accounts to make sure they align with your estate planning goals. Specify Your End-Of-Life Plans In the unfortunate event of you not being able to make decisions about your care, it is essential to put in writing and name a medical power of attorney. Your medical power of attorney will help ensure that your wishes are followed with regard to critical health care decisions. Make Funeral Arrangements in Advance Creating a will also serves as an opportunity to make your funeral arrangements. You can specify your wishes regarding your funeral, be it a traditional burial or cremation. Consider Creating a Trust to Avoid Public Records Creating a trust is an excellent option for those who want to keep their affairs private.

A warmbased glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact.

Reflect on why your action was wrong. Repent for the right reasons. Read the text.","output":"As human beings, we are bound to make mistakes from time to time. It is in our nature to err, but what sets us apart is our ability to reflect, learn, and grow from those mistakes. The key to making progress is to acknowledge our mistakes and to repent for the right reasons. In doing so, we must be humble, feel and trust God in our hearts, and read the text. Being humble is crucial because it allows us to approach a situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn. It also helps us to appreciate the perspectives of others and to recognize the impact of our actions on those around us. Humility requires us to put aside our ego and to be receptive to feedback, even if it is not what we want to hear. Feeling and trusting God in our hearts is important because it helps us to tap into our inner wisdom and to find strength in our faith. When we are faced with difficult situations or choices, we can draw on our faith to guide us and to give us peace of mind. Trusting in God means that we believe in his plan for us and that we are willing to relinquish control when necessary. Reflecting on our actions and understanding why they were wrong is an essential step in the process of repentance. This requires us to be honest with ourselves and to take responsibility for the harm we may have caused. By reflecting on our actions, we can gain insight into our behavior and make the necessary changes to ensure that we do not repeat the same mistakes. Repenting for the right reasons means that we are genuinely sorry for our actions and are committed to making amends. It is not enough to simply apologize; we must also take concrete steps to repair the damage we have caused. This may involve asking for forgiveness, making restitution, or even seeking professional counseling. Reading the text refers to the importance of studying scripture and the teachings of our faith. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the principles that guide our lives and use them as a compass to navigate difficult situations. The text can also serve as a source of inspiration and comfort when we feel lost or overwhelmed. In conclusion, the process of repentance requires us to be humble, feel and trust God in our hearts, reflect on our actions, repent for the right reasons, and read the text. By following these guidelines, we can learn from our mistakes, grow as individuals, and strengthen our faith."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 5766*u + 5731*u = 10028*u 102830 for u.","output":"The solution for the math problem is u = 20."},{"instruction":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","output":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning would require them to solve problems related to spatial relationships, object manipulation, or movement analysis."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence His initial goal as general secretary was to revive the Soviet economy, and he realized that doing so would require reforming underlying political and social structures. provide a valid answer to the question What caused Chernenko to leave office?

Most important was the pervasive secularism that came to dominate American public life, which sought to confine religion to a private sphere. Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, antiCatholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.[citation needed] Now answer this question: What is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths?","output":"Strict separationism is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths."},{"instruction":"Read this: Vinyl records can be warped by heat, improper storage, exposure to sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover.

James Crowley has sparked a national dialogue on race relations and police brutality. However, in a surprising turn of events, President Obama invited both men to the White House for a beer to discuss the incident and hopefully ease tensions. Adding to the irony of this meeting is the fact that Attorney General Eric Holder called the incident a \\"teachable moment\\" for the country, as it highlighted the ongoing discrimination faced by African Americans in their everyday lives. This sentiment was echoed by the attorney for the 911 caller, who noted the irony in three people who \\"reacted badly\\" sitting down for a beer together. But amidst the tension and controversy, one detail that has been largely overlooked is the fact that Professor Gates walks with a cane due to a white doctor's misdiagnosis when he was just 14 years old. This serves as a bleak reminder of the structural racism that permeates all aspects of American society, and the lasting physical and emotional toll it can take on individuals. Furthermore, it is worth noting that not all black individuals have spoken out against Sgt. Crowley. In fact, two black cops have come forward to defend his actions and claim that race played no role in the arrest. This further emphasizes the complexity of the issues at play and the need for nuanced discussions that acknowledge the diversity of perspectives within marginalized communities.
