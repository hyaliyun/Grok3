Good old greasy, covered with sauce, hotter than blazes chicken wings. ** This guy is surrendering to the wing gods.

It’ll be good for your joints or something. I almost forgot about the blue cheese. If you’re like me, you’re going to coat your fire wings with the stuff before you eat them. You’ll also get some stuck in your goatee, and it will be a pain to get out. As far as your fingers go, it’s a combination of licking the sauce off and wiping your hand with a paper towel. Neither method will work by itself. I don’t know how you could eat wings in a “civilized” manner. With a knife and fork? No way, you’d be laughed out of your own dining room.

A Geonosian named Klik Klak had kept her safe all these years. She was named after Queen Karina the great; one of Geonosis’ first queens. Vader used force and took her factory, then used it to produce a small army of BX-Series Droid Commandos to help him in his task of eliminating Dr Cylo. Although Palpatine ordered Vader to give the shutdown command to all the Battle Droids of the Separatist Alliance, small pockets of droids resisted the order to shutdown, and continued to operate not realising that the war was over,.. and the newly formed Galactic Empire had replaced the Republic. The Empire hunted and eliminated most of these droid pockets during its formative years. Droids such as Kalani, a Super Tactical Droid, resisted the shutdown command believing it to be a Republic trick. He and his army of B1 Battle Droids, and Droidekas, remained in the collapsed hulk of an old Separatist DH-Omni Support Vessel on the planet of Agamar. Kalani overrode Vaders signal during the shutdown order, and on Agamar they remained until members of the Rebel cell Phoenix Squadron came and let Kalani and his droid forces know that the Clone Wars was over; but not before he put up a valiant final effort in events that seen the Empire intervene, and swiftly cease hostilities between the Rebels and the Droid Army."},{"instruction":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","output":"There are several companies that offer excellent mobile application development services.

Here are a few possible paths they can consider: 1️⃣ Internships: Engaging in internships or co-op programs can provide valuable hands-on experience and help bridge the gap between graduation and securing a full-time position. This can also help graduates build important industry connections. 2️⃣ Continuing Education: Pursuing further education, such as a master's degree or specialized certifications, can enhance a civil engineer's skill set and make them more marketable to potential employers. 3️⃣ Networking: Actively participating in industry events, joining professional organizations, and utilizing online platforms can help civil engineers expand their professional network. Networking can lead to job opportunities and valuable industry connections. 4️⃣ Freelancing or Consulting: Offering services as a freelance civil engineer or consultant can provide valuable work experience and income while searching for permanent employment. This option allows engineers to showcase their skills and build a portfolio of work. 5️⃣ Volunteering: Donating time and skills to nonprofit organizations, community projects, or charitable causes can provide civil engineers with practical experience, allow them to give back to the community, and demonstrate their commitment to the profession. It's important for civil engineers to remain proactive, persistent, and adaptable during their job search. By exploring these avenues, graduates can continue to develop their skills, gain experience, and increase their chances of securing a placement in the future.💪🏗️🌟"},{"instruction":"What kind of messages have you received from people on Instagram?","output":"Thank you for requesting 😁 !!

In most Western airports, no one checks and technically you could walk out with any suitcase you want - unless stopped by the rightful owner. Generally, people are honest enough to collect their own baggage only. There’s always the risk of picking up someone else’s case and being pulled for a customs check, which could go horribly wrong. The airports tend to prefer to keep people moving as quickly as possible and leave it to the individual to pick up the correct cases. Time (and a crowd of people) is money, as they say. The preference is the deterrent of security cameras and the risk of being held liable for someone else’s contents, should you be stopped. In other parts of the world, India for example, that little sticky label the check in staff put on the back of your passport or boarding card, becomes hugely important. That’s your luggage receipt and you will not be allowed to leave the airport without it matching the cases collected. After collecting your baggage, there’s an exit inspection of the receipt and it’s matched to the label on the bag. I have witnessed someone being pulled aside for taking the wrong case. They definitely take it seriously."},{"instruction":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","output":"A true friend will always be there with you through tragedy, sorrow, good times, bad times, times of celebration, and will always love you and accept you for who you are, not for who they want you to be I know this from experience.

Rapid weight loss may not be sustainable in the long run and can have adverse health effects. Aim for a gradual and steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week for safe and lasting results. 2. Focus on Nutrition Eating a balanced and nutrient-rich diet is paramount to quick and healthy weight loss. Opt for whole foods such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Cut back on processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-calorie beverages. Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. 3. Stay Hydrated Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day not only supports overall health but also aids in weight loss. Water helps control appetite, boosts metabolism, and can prevent overeating. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. 4. Incorporate Physical Activity Engaging in regular physical activity is essential for burning calories and accelerating weight loss. Aim for a combination of cardiovascular exercises (such as walking, jogging, or cycling) and strength training (using weights or resistance bands) to build muscle and boost metabolism. 5. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Consider incorporating HIIT workouts into your fitness routine. HIIT involves alternating between high-intensity exercises and short rest periods. This approach is effective in burning calories, increasing metabolic rate, and improving cardiovascular fitness. 6. Get Adequate Sleep Prioritize quality sleep, as inadequate sleep can hinder weight loss efforts. Poor sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite, leading to increased cravings and overeating. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night."},{"instruction":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","output":"I have rocks in my garden that would make a better president than Trump."},{"instruction":"Sometimes when I'm on a WhatsApp call, the app suddenly says call on hold.

They had 11″ guns, and would have had a hard time wearing down Ramillies. Barring outragous luck, I can’t see any way of sinking Ramilles that doesn’t also sink one of the ugly sisters. Now, remember; Germany had two heavy battleships- Tirpitz and Bismark, two lighter ones, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and some heavy cruisers- the Deutchland and Admiral hipper classes. The British had far more battleships and battlecruisers. If you trade ships on a 1:1 basis, like Hood and Bismark, the side who starts with fewer runs out. Keeping S&G functioning, and they’re a threat to many convoys, so require lots of effort to cover against. Order them to engage, and play it out. Ramilles fights, and the convoy scatters, and probably gets mauled by Uboats. Scharnhorst is crippled, unable to do above three knots, and come nightfall gets torpedeod by a destroyer. Gneisenau takes heavy hits forward, wrecking a fore turret, and requiring the forward magazine to be flooded to prevent the fire causing and explosion. It breaks off and heads for France Ramilles is heavily battered, but still floating. She may make port,or may get finished off by a Uboat. If she makes port, the damage is probably so severe she gets placed in reserve, and her crew end up on 10 new destroyers. Net result? The germans see two ships sunk or out of action for a year, the British one."},{"instruction":"there anything about the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash that just doesn’t add up?","output":"Pending investigation, the case is still unexplainable at best. As always, things that just don't add up are typically “witnesses' reports”.

Heck, newer more silent engines can also sound like sputter too in certain environmental condition and background noise. I think that's all. FAA already ruled out engine failure as the cause of the crash. There are other resurfacing facts that may or may not be relevant to this accident such as: [LINKED_TEXT: Kobe Bryant’s pilot counseled on flying in low visibility after improper flight path in 2015] [URL: https://www.ocregister.com/kobe-bryants-pilot-counseled-on-flying-in-low-visibility-after-improper-flight-path-in-2015] Yeah? The pilot, Ara Zobayan self-reported the procedural mishaps himself. This reinforces the belief about the pilot's reputation for being professional and safety-minded. This article discussed about this fact in its body, but the title can be quite clickbaity and inviting for speculations.

I mean that's natural, but be mindful about is consequences, especially if you are public official or politicians. We must wait for the investigation to be completed by the professionals, even if it meant waiting for years. The number one priority is as always not answering our curiosity or personal questions, but preventing the same accident from happening again. Thus getting the correct answer is very important here. There are other non-technical, NBA-gossipy aspects to this accident, that it happened not long after LeBron James surpassed Kobe Bryant in all-time NBA scoring record. I guess that is just a sheer coincidence, most likely nothing to do with the accident.

You won’t have to compete with PhD students for attention, so if you want to work on research, it’s relatively easy. It’s a popular recruiting site for SV companies large and small, because the programs are high quality, because it’s local, and because it’s a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI).

Neither is true. Increasingly, the UCs are unable to offer the kind of educational experience that many students want. In addition, a competitive California student can choose a CSU and be confident of admission, even to an impacted program. However, and this is important, outside of academia and outside of the local area (stretching no further than the borders of California), name recognition is pretty low. Stanford will get you an interview in Boston or New York long before SJSU. That’s not surprising; education is local. I cannot stress this enough: UCs are not better, and CSUs are not worse.

And we can go for a lot but below I’ve mentioned the major factors so you should look at those and decide if you should buy what you are getting in exchange of your money What Matters the Most? Below are some of the key factors to acknowledge when you are wondering about how to buy a mattress. Support→ The mattress should be sturdy enough to handle all types of body weights. Also, make sure that it can easily accommodate additional layers of blankets and comforters with no effect over its comfort. For this, you can look forward to various thickness options of 4\\" inch, 5\\" inch, 6\\" inch, 8\\" inch and many others. Temperature→ The mattress should instill the body temperature and stay apt with it. So, look for those having gel-infused layer that is cool to the body. This initiates you to pick a mattress that can adapt as per the body temperature. Breathing Accessibility→ A mattress type also varies with the appropriate use of material to regulate the ventilation and comfort factor. So look over mattresses that have well-structured cotton layer. Organic cotton layer over a mattress enhance its ability to breathe, thus eliminating the presence of allergies. Pressure Relief Point→ While checking for a mattress, look for those which have transition layer right above. This layer is for providing lumbar support ensuring an aligned spine and healthy sleep every night. Posture Adaptability→ Opt for mattresses that have a layer dedicated to posture adaptability. This makes it easy to take a nap loaded with snug and vanishes the pressure on the body. Where to Shop for a Mattress?

As such the Air Inlet Temp maximums were raised from 427º to 450ºC for this flight. Conditions did not allow any top speeds to be broken. There are pics of the actual printout from the jet following that attempted top speed ass. These jets were always flying as fast as they could, within operational limits. Many stories of pilots making turns and esp. speeding up to avoid missiles should be taken with a grain of salt. You couldn’t just pin the throttle and attain top speeds, weights winds and temps all came into play. Once at top altitudes, which is planned to occur over your target area, there isnt much (if any) throttle left to stuff in. These jets are always in afterburner, and even when the SR71 was refueling, the longer SR71 jet holding more fuel(compared to A-12) required minimum afterburner, in ONE engine, to allow it to keep up with the tanker as it’s fuel load approached full (80,000 pounds, the higher flying/slightly faster A-12 only carried 68,000 pounds of fuel). The problem with the Foxbat was that its engines were NOT designed to cruise at Mach 3 speeds, the A-12/SR-71/M-21/YF-12A were.

In fact, it is the very reason why I prefer minority governments as it forces such cooperation. Liberal cooperation and support from the NDP in exchange for certain NDP policy planks being advanced is how some of the greatest things in this country have come about, such as universal healthcare. The Liberals and the NDP agree on a whole lot of things. Often times it’s only a matter of to what degree they wish to go. Being willing to compromise and work together towards advancing those goals is a wonderful development and one that should happen more often. Given that the majority of Canadians voted for these two parties, along with the Bloc who, despite their whole anti-federalist Quebec Sovereignty thing, generally agree with the Liberals on most other things, it sounds like we might actually be getting a government that can accomplish things that most Canadians want, and without there having to be another pointless election a year after the last one to confirm it. Of course, I would personally prefer that the NDP was in the drivers seat here and it remains to be seen what will actually be accomplished, but there’s reason to be hopeful."},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

Is it as bad as his previous books?","output":"I am not a big fan of chetan bhagat's novels. But while talking about this novel, this novel is crime,drama, thriller and a story that tells you nobody is perfect. I have read the novel THE GIRL IN ROOM 105 . I think this is one of the best book ever written by chetan bhagat. I don't want to spoil the book for you but any way, I will do it. The protagonist of the story is keshav . Keshav had completed his IIT a few years back and had been working in Chandan classes. He doesn't like his job. He lived in a small flat with his freind saurabh . They both were working in the same institution. Keshav was in a relationship with Zara lone . Zara was from srinagar, kashmir. They had there break up 5 years ago but keshav was still into her. He liked her. He called zara on every new year and on her birthday thinking she will come back in a relationship with him .But zara refused to talk because she was in a relationship with Raghu .Zara didn't want to talk to keshav and was not willing to reply. But there was a big turn in the story. Zara messaged Keshav on her birthday at midnight and asked keshav to come to her room. Room 105. When keshav arrived by climbing the mango tree near her window and found Zara’s dead body. Here, Keshav adventure begins. Step by step keshav reveals and realised about Zara's past . Her father,mother and her brother relations with the terriorts of kashmir. While searching for Zara's murderer he met Faiz. Faiz was a reputed military officer posted in kashmir. As keshav breaks the case a little more he found gold biscuits in Faiz's house. The end of the story brings twist in the story. As the murderer posed in the previous chapter comes up to be a different person. The story changes the traits and ideas of both keshav as well as the reader about the true meaning of love. It tells that every one is a human,everyone makes mistakes and no body is perfect. It also shows that a trust worthy person can also be a devil under disguised. This is first story written by chetan bhagat which does not primarily focus on the concept of love as it focuses on the truth of life and the truth of human beings . I would definitely advise you to read this book. The story is good and it's nicely written. I can assure you that reading this book is not a waste ,you will be entertained and thrilled. At last I think you will like my thoughts on the book, THE GIRL IN ROOM 105 and as always thanks for reading.!"},{"instruction":"Does Walmart sell prime ribs?","output":"No"},{"instruction":"f you tell a taxi or Uber driver to just drive, where will they go?","output":"Taxi, I have no idea, but with Uber you have to set your destination as part of the vehicle request , so he will take you to that destination."},{"instruction":"Can an unmarried couple stay in Coimbatore?","output":"Coimbatore is declared as the safest city in the year 2017 .

San Francisco has, in my experience far more casual littering than other cities I’ve visited or lived in. We are currently in a situation where there are eight to ten thousand “homeless” people on our streets, a large chunk who to be perfectly blunt are not capable of caring for themselves and their own hygiene due to mental and drug problems. They root through trash cans looking for food or discarded items that they may be able to use, often just discarding the things that they don’t want directly on the streets. Many push shopping trolleys filled to the top with junk. The junk spills out and blows around. They also live in tent encampments surrounded by trash, and they move around, leaving the rubbish behind. In short, we have a societal problem here that makes our streets filthy. I don’t think that they have such a problem in Vancouver, or indeed, many other places. Another issue is, due to budget (and other?) issues, a whole lot of trash cans have just disappeared. SF is committed to “zero landfill” in the coming years, and part of that is to reduce the ability of people to just “throw trash ‘away’.” Well, that’s great if you’re at home and can sort recycle, compost, and rubbish. But if there are few to no trash cans on the sidewalk, many are, honestly, just either overfilling the existing ones or stuffing the trash in places where it just does not belong (go by any bus stop and see how many cups, newspapers, stuffed into the gaps between the plastic seats). We need more public bins. But generally (and I mean no offence to Americans - I am happy to be an American), my observation is that Canadians are just more…tidy? than Americans are? Canadians take a much more generous view of “the commons” - those public assets that we all share. And thus, they are just generally more conscientious about taking care to keep things that others share more clean and to leave a smaller footprint."},{"instruction":"found a red room on the deep web, how can I report it without getting myself in trouble?","output":"First of all, there are very explicit and better quality gore videos on the surface web that load much faster.

Facial Exercises: Perform facial exercises such as cheek lifts, jaw movements, and chin lifts to tone and strengthen the facial muscles. 3. Stay Hydrated: Drink an adequate amount of water daily to maintain hydration and promote healthy skin. 4. Healthy Diet: Consume a nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while minimizing processed foods and sugary beverages. 5. Limit Sodium Intake: Reduce your sodium consumption as excessive sodium can contribute to water retention and bloating. 6. Cardiovascular Exercise: Engage in cardiovascular activities like running, swimming, or cycling to burn calories and promote overall weight loss. 7. Limit Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol can lead to dehydration and facial bloating, so it's best to moderate or avoid alcohol intake. 8. Get Sufficient Sleep: Aim for quality sleep as inadequate sleep can contribute to fluid retention and puffiness in the face. 9. Facial Massage: Regularly massaging the face can help improve blood circulation and promote lymphatic drainage, reducing facial puffiness. 10. Avoid Smoking: Smoking can contribute to sagging skin and accelerate the aging process, including in the face."},{"instruction":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","output":"This is one I struggle with.

Fires like to consume fuel and when conditions are right, they eat voraciously. The factors that influence fire spread are: the type of fuelthe moisture level of the fuel and prevailing humiditywind speed/directionterrain (slope) Some fuels burn faster than others, just like kindling versus logs. So thin grasses/shrubs will go faster than trees. The moisture in the air and the fuel also plays a big factor. The longer things have to dry out, the faster they will ignite. As far as humidity, according to the National Park Service “Light fuels, such as grass and pine needles, gain and lose moisture quickly with changes in relative humidity. When the RH drops, fire behavior increases because these fine fuels become drier. Heavy fuels, on the other hand, respond to humidity changes more slowly.” [LINKED_TEXT: Understanding Fire Danger (U.S. National Park Service)Since 1974, five rating levels have been used to describe danger levels in public information releases and fire prevention signing: Low (Green) —Fire starts are unlikely. Weather and fuel conditions will lead to slow fire spread, low intensity, and relatively easy control with light mop up. Controlled burns can usually be executed with reasonable safety. Moderate (Blue) —Some wildfires may be expected. Expect moderate flame length and rate of spread. Control is usually not difficult and light to moderate mop up can be expected. Although controlled burning can be done without creating a hazard, routine caution should be taken. High (Yellow) —Wildfires are likely. Fires in heavy, continuous fuel, such as mature grassland, weed fields, and forest litter, will be difficult to control under windy conditions. Control through direct attack may be difficult but possible, and mop up will be required. Outdoor burning should be restricted to early morning and late evening hours. Very High (Orange) —Fires start easily from all causes and may spread faster than suppression resources can travel. Flame lengths will be long with high intensity, making control very difficult. Both suppression and mop up will require an extended and very thorough effort. Outdoor burning is not recommended. Extreme (Red) —Fires will start and spread rapidly. Every fire start has the potential to become large. Expect extreme, erratic fire behavior. NO OUTDOOR BURNING SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN AREAS WITH EXTREME FIRE DANGER. Relative Humidity Relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the amount of moisture in the air to the amount of moisture necessary to saturate the air at the same temperature and pressure. Relative humidity is expressed in percent. RH is measured directly by automated weather stations or manually by wet and dry bulb readings taken with a psychrometer and applying the National Weather Service psychrometric tables applicable to the elevations where the reading were taken. Relative humidity is important because dead forest fuels and the air are always exchanging moisture. Low humidity takes moisture from the fuels, and fuels in turn, take moisture from the air when the humidity is high. Light fuels, such as grass and pine needles, gain and lose moisture quickly with changes in relative humidity. When the RH drops, fire behavior increases because these fine fuels become drier. Heavy fuels, on the other hand, respond to humidity changes more slowly. To see significant changes in heavy fuel moisture, there must be significant moisture, usually from more than a single storm. Fuel Moisture Fuel moisture is measured for live herbaceous (annual and perennial) and woody (shrubs, branches, and foliage) fuels and dry (dead) fuels. These are calculated values representing approximate moisture content of the fuel . Fuel moisture in live fuels varies through the growing season and between different climate classes. There are 20 different fuel models, representing the variety of vegetatiohttps://www.nps.gov/articles/understanding-fire-danger.htm#:~:text=Light%20fuels%2C%20such%20as%20grass,to%20humidity%20changes%20more%20slowly.] [URL: https://www.nps.gov/articles/understanding-fire-danger.htm#%3A~%3Atext%3DLight%20fuels%2C%20such%20as%20grass%2Cto%20humidity%20changes%20more%20slowly.]Wind will obviously drive the fire along faster. That was the issue with a recent New Mexico prescribed burn. The conditions were right, but after the burn started the winds picked up and now it has consumed 260,000 acres since April 6th. Finally, fire moves at a steady pace on it’s own, but if it is on an “upslope”, the rising heat will dry out and prewarm the fuel ahead of it allowing it to gain speed. The opposite is true on a “down slope”. Fires can burn through areas inaccessible to man and machine necessitating, at times, getting well ahead of the fire and allowing it to burn to you. And unlike city streets where you may find a hydrant every 500 feet, in the wilderness your water supply could be miles away and being brought in by air tanker, helicopter, or numerous ground tenders 500–1000 gallons at a time."},{"instruction":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","output":"skiing, and outdoor adventures.Petra, Jordan: An archaeological wonder and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Petra is a breathtaking ancient city carved into pink sandstone cliffs, featuring stunning temples, tombs, and amphitheaters.The Great Barrier Reef, Australia: The world's largest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef is a kaleidoscope of colors and marine life that's perfect for snorkeling, diving, and sailing.Angkor Wat, Cambodia: A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most significant archaeological sites in Southeast Asia, Angkor Wat is a sprawling temple complex built in the 12th century, featuring intricate carvings, towers, and bas-reliefs.The Swiss Alps: With their snow-capped peaks, charming villages, and scenic train rides, the Swiss Alps offer some of the most breathtaking views in Europe, as well as skiing, hiking, and mountaineering opportunities.The Grand Canyon, USA: A natural wonder and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Grand Canyon is a massive geological formation carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, featuring stunning rock formations, colorful sunsets, and hiking trails.The Amalfi Coast, Italy: A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most picturesque and romantic places in Italy, the Amalfi Coast features colorful cliffside villages, dramatic views of the sea, and delicious local cuisine.

I blame this entire experience on myself as I took one of my former friends (who I should have realised would have been a major drama queen throughout this movie) walked out of the freaken theater after the first jump scare. I mean, does anyone actually remember if there were jump scares or not in that movie? Who the fuck cares anyways. It’s the Grudge 2 for crying out loud! The English adaptation at that. Also my mistake for thinking that she and I could just enjoy a movie without her having to make a big deal when the first time the long haired creep chick made her first appearance. So most of you would think that I followed her out of the theater and asked her what was wrong as I let her lean on my shoulder and cry, right? Wrong. I let her walk out by herself. Her own mother wasn’t home at the time so she had to wait for my mother to come to the theater, pick us both up and drive us home. Honorable mention: I went to see the very first Iron Man movie with a friend from high school. I felt bad because she didn’t have much money but was hungry and looked like she could use a snack. Also, wouldn’t you think that the person with the money gets to ordeer the snacks in this situation? No, she smiles like a fucking madwoman, runs right up to the counter and orders a LARGE popcorn and a LARGE soda. I wasn’t sure how much money she thought I had, since we were both teenagers at the time. My older self would have gladly to tell her to screw off, but my teenage self stood there with shock and paid for the snacks. I got a small soda for myself. She didn’t offer me any popcorn throughout the movie, but I happily reached over taking massive handfuls for myself throughout the movie. I now go to movies alone. And every movie alone has been a magical experience. I figured why do I need to take someone with me if I am going to be sitting in a dark room for a couple hours and you aren’t supposed to talk throughout the movie anyways? I am going to see Avengers: Endgame tomorrow. And I’ll enjoy a large popcorn and soda all by myself, smiling from ear to ear. Sorry if I came off as an asshole.

Longbows or not, hitting men in the dark is not easy. So, night attack it is, with ropes or stairs if possible to get as many men as you can onto the walls, and the rest rushing the (hopefully) open gate. In close quarters and with steel chainmail and swords and shields, the Spartans should overcome the local garrison of men at arms and the few knights around the Lord. And that’s it, a longshot that needs plenty of luck but it’s the only way I see."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"Its depend upon on your niche.

Don't they realize that there are a lot of beautiful women with no partners there? I love dancing, but for me, it meant partying on popular music. Eventually, I stopped the little partying I was doing, and the dancing was sidelined too. Time flies and I discovered Zumba, this led me to appreciate Latin music and later salsa with a partner. IF I ever try ballroom chacha, it will only be because it’s an acquired taste. I used to think the styling is ridiculous, the music boring and why in hell bother with trying to synchronize perfectly with a partner? I know better now, but it’s still unclear if I’ll ever try ballroom. So, to answer the question, I think ballroom is similar to a scented candle party for the average North American dude. The activity is so unappealing that being surrounded by nice ladies doesn’t compensate. But contrary to candle parties, I’ll probably try ballroom one day!"},{"instruction":"Which is the most unbiased news outlet?","output":"As an AI language model, I strive to remain neutral and not take a position on political or social issues. However, I can provide some general guidelines to help identify news sources that are considered to be relatively objective and unbiased. Here are some tips for evaluating news sources: Check for the source's reputation: Check the reputation of the news source and see if it has a history of factual, unbiased reporting. You can check the source's website and look for their mission statement, editorial policies, and their history.Avoid sensational headlines: Be wary of headlines that use exaggerated or sensational language to grab attention. These headlines are often designed to generate clicks and may not accurately represent the content of the article.Cross-check multiple sources: Verify news stories by consulting multiple sources, including ones that have different perspectives. Compare how different sources present the same story.Avoid opinionated or partisan content: Opinionated content or content that clearly reflects a particular political or ideological bias can be difficult to distinguish from factual news. Look for news sources that focus on reporting facts and events, rather than offering commentary or opinion.

The amount of money you earn is linked to your ability. If not many people can do what you do, you can get a big reward. For other engineers, success is the opportunity to work on exciting and world class projects and be recognised for their contribution. Regardless how you define success, here is what you need to succeed. Passion for the profession is what you need to drive your career. It is the inner force that makes you sail the ups and downs of a career in engineering. It is what keeps you in the office late at night working on projects not because you have to but because you want to. It is what pushes you to study and improve your skills.Technical Knowledge and ability to use it to solve problems. Engineering is the art and science to deal with mother nature so you need sound hard skills and know the engineering theory behind formulas. There is no shortcut but years of study and continue professional development.You need Persistence both as a student and then as an engineer. Be accountable for your failures but never give up on your dreams. Keep trying . Any day past is a step closer to your goal if you persist in your action.You need to have Strategy to get where you want to go and to be who you want to be. Select jobs that are in line with the career path you want to take and choose the company that will give you the opportunity to develop the skills you require to be successful. You select the company and not the other way around.Pick a good Mentor and not a good company. The two hardly coincide. Especially at the beginning of a career, a mentor can teach things that may take years to conquer. A mentor is a senior engineer willing to spend time with you to build your skills. A mentor is someone who enjoys watching you succeed because your success will be his/her. It is very difficult to understand if a company has a real mentor. Generally speaking small companies or small teams in medium-large companies offer the best mentorship opportunities to young engineers.You need to be picky about your Career path. Once your have worked out which niche of the engineering profession you like the most and would like to master, don't lose sight of it. It will come a time when an opportunity knocks at the door wanting you to steer your career path to another direction. It could be an offer from another company or internal to the company you work for. Don’t venture in that territory unless you have a plan B to go back to your previous role. The stakes are higher when you are senior as you have less time to make up a wrong choice.You need to Respect everybody but fear nobody. Eventually, and in different forms, everybody will be bullied in their career. A client, a colleague, a subcontractor will bully you. It is certain. It could come verbally or in writing but it will come and force you to face the pressure. Stay calm, be polite and do what you think is the right thing and not what others tell you. Reputation takes years to gain and seconds to lose. I think that reputation is the best asset for an engineer, take care of it.Always be Professional. What I mean is that your professional judgment is your best alley. Don't agree on changing your position, idea, solution, design if you truly believe in it. Be open to suggestions and accept critiques but defend your point.

Thanks for reaching out with your question. Making money online without any investment is definitely possible in 2023. Let me share with you a few methods that can help you get started. One of the popular ways to make money online without investment is through freelance work. If you have a skill or talent, such as writing, graphic design, programming, or even social media management, you can offer your services on freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer. Create a profile showcasing your expertise, and start bidding on projects or gigs that match your skills. As you complete more projects and gain positive feedback from clients, you can gradually increase your rates and attract more clients. Another avenue to explore is affiliate marketing. This involves promoting products or services and earning a commission for every sale or lead generated through your referral. You can sign up for affiliate programs offered by various companies or join affiliate networks like Amazon Associates, ClickBank, or CJ Affiliate. Find products or services that align with your interests or niche, create engaging content (such as blog posts, videos, or social media posts) to promote them, and include your unique affiliate links. When someone makes a purchase through your link, you earn a commission. Now, let me share a little story from my own life. A few years ago, I found myself in a similar situation, looking for ways to make money online without any investment. At that time, I had a passion for writing and decided to try my hand at freelance writing. I created an account on a freelancing platform and started bidding on writing projects. It was a slow start, but with persistence and continuous improvement, I began to land more and more projects. As I gained experience and positive feedback, clients started approaching me directly for their writing needs. This allowed me to increase my rates and choose projects that truly interested me. Eventually, I even built a small team of writers and started taking on more significant projects. Freelancing not only helped me make money but also gave me the freedom to work from anywhere and manage my own time. So, my friend, don't underestimate the possibilities that exist in the online world. With determination, effort, and a little creativity, you can definitely make money online without any initial investment.

I can only speak of my own experience. When Target moved into Toronto they bought up all the Zeller’s stores. Zellers was a Canadian five and dime store, like Woolco, Kmart, Walmart. Personally speaking, I went out on opening day to one store, and I was pretty disappointed. Yes, they had their fabled big, wide aisles. Yes, they were very clean and tidy. But all their products were the same as Woolco, Kmart and Walmart — even Zellers with pretty much the same prices. It was opening day and I had hoped some hoopla was in order. Free coffee and treats, free balloons, free discounts. A banner at least saying, Opening Day. But nada, nothing. For all I knew the store had been there for years. This was just the first time I walked into it. And as I said, it had absolutely nothing on the existing five and dime stores (which I know I know aren’t five and dime anymore). Nothing was different enough for me to bother going there again. I did go to another store about a year later and was surprised to see how empty it was, compared to Walmart. And then they left. From what I heard Walmart pulled out all the big guns. Not sure what they did but there was no way they were letting another competitor in.

Some problems, of course, were created by misguided Congressional oversight and Congress often gets blamed. But in truth, that was arguably only a small part of the problem in the big picture. The idea of a reusable space plane has been a dream of space enthusiasts since before there was a space program. This idea was pitched to Congress and the administration as a way to dramatically lower costs, to make accessing space more reliable and safer. The reality is that nobody had any real idea how to make a real space plane. It was something that sounded nice but was technologically beyond anybody's capability at the time. So NASA contorted itself in reality though space shuttle system was far more expensive and far more impractical than conventional rockets. It was also far more complex to maintain making it reliability and safety highly problematic. Unfortunately, the situation became even worse than that. Though developing the initial fleet of space shuttles had been insanely expensive, Congress had been promised that the costs of maintaining the fleet would be relatively low. In fact, the costs were incredibly high. As a result, there was virtually no money for replacing old shuttles as they aged or for investigating new, better designs for space vehicles. So the space shuttles we're costing the government of fortune and were gradually aging and decaying. And as their reliability continued to get worse, public enthusiasm for manned space travel eroded as well, only hurting NASA even more. Sadly, the US space program could be much further along today if the whole space plane idea had been killed early on. This is not to say that someday space planes may not become a reality, but certainly in the 1970s there was no realistic way a space plane could be built. The technology simply wasn't there."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to prepare for AWS Certified Developer (Associate) in 2017?","output":"I would say that keeping content up to date is a common factor with all course providers (cloud guru included - who ‘full disclosure’ im a content creator for).

These are the finalists and I choose FO'22 as the BEST. (It is very hard to choose one. All were really great.) Image below: Nadal and his 22nd major trophy FO'22. After his absence by the 2021 injury, Nadal came back and won AO'22 which was AMAZING. After that, Nadal had another ATP title, injury (rib stress fracture), and absence by this new injury. Then, the clay court season started and Nadal came back. He didn't do well and he was even LIMPING during a match. That was by his foot problem. That was how he left. So, when Nadal came back and started at FO'22, no one knew about Nadal's condition and about how well he was going to do there! Until Nadal won the FO, no one knew the secret. What a brilliant solution! Nadal’s painful foot was numbed by multiple injections throughout the French Open. So, he kept going and lifted the trophy which was Nadal's 14th FO and 22nd major. The bestest of the bests. For me the highlight was Nadal's quarter final match against Djokovic. (At the 2021 FO, Nadal was beaten by Djokovic in the semifinal. Nadal's foot problem returned there and the rest of the year was a nightmare.) Beating Djokovic in the quarterfinal is THE BEST VICTORY. I include images from the other four great victories here. Nadal and his father at Nadal's AO'22 victory. Nadal was 21 there. First men's singles player to reach 21. “For Nadal's father, his son is always a little boy who amazes everyone by his extraordinary talent.” The image below is FO'20. Nadal was 20, and joined Federer who won 20 first. During Nadal's consecutive 18 French Opens, he celebrated his birthday AND a title at 13 French Opens. Another FO title came at a French Open where Nadal didn't have his birthday. This was the one. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, FO'20 was held in Sep/Oct of that year instead of May/June. AO'09.

The argument that Pro-Life libertarianism in an oxymoron misrepresents Libertarianism as meaning “fiscally conservative but Socially liberal”. In fact that’s not what it is. Libertarianism is a political ideology that posits that every law is by its very nature an infringement upon freedom of the individual and as such the government should not issue any laws except inasmuch as legislation is essential to the prevention of harm. That harm prevention bit is known as the Non-Aggression Principle. If a fetus is a human life then the Non Aggression Principle not only allows but requires legislation against abortion. And if a fetus isn’t a human life then Libertarianism would condemn any and all legislation against abortion as an infringement upon bodily autonomy. The dispute between Pro-Life Libertarians and Pro-Choice Libertarians is that the former believe that a fetus is a human life and as such consider abortion worthy of criminalization according to the dictates of the Non Aggression Principle whereas Pro-Choice Libertarians disagree with the assertion that the fetus is a human life and as such don’t believe that the Non Aggression Principle applies in this case.

Broadly speaking, people only visit the doctor if they: (a) think they might be ‘sick’ (or injured, ill, coming down with something, etc) (b) aren’t actually ‘sick’ but are trying to get the doctor to certify them ‘sick’ for some other purpose (eg, to get a day off work) or certify them ‘healthy’ (eg, medical for a new job or visa application) In case (a) they should be able to see the doctor to determine if they are, or are not, ‘sick’. In case (b) they *have* to see the doctor in order to get the certification they need. It’s up to the doctor to make a decision on the merits and the context. The only people who might visit the doctor for no reason other than the visit itself are either lonely, or living in a non-universal private insurance healthcare system like the US, Ethiopia, Paraguay, or Yemen, where they want to make sure they get their money’s worth from their plan."},{"instruction":"What TV series are worth watching?","output":"I think the old sitcoms are ideal for working people who need 20-minute breaks.

The American Astronomical Society. We present stellar evolution calculations for the lowest mass stars, i.e., those stars with masses in the range 0.08 M_☉ ≤ M_* ≤ 0.25 M_☉. We find that stars with masses M < 0.20 M_☉ will never evolve through a red giant stage. After becoming gradually brighter and bluer for trillions of years, these late M dwarfs of today will develop radiative-conductive cores and mild nuclear shell sources; these stars then end their lives as helium white dwarfs.

What would Japan government do in response?","output":"It’s rather sad. Population collapsing, deflation, challenges moving to consumer based economy and overstock of infrastructure… CCP knows very well where it stands. It’s at the end of the runway. We know, we have been there. China needs help, but it knows not how to ask. Hence he blurted out a very poorly engineered and schizophrenic attempt at… not quite a request for assistance, but more like call for solidarity? We can only guess the stress he must be under, poor fellow. It is also a treasure trove of insight. Notably, he seems to believe ethnicity still plays a role in today’s political ideology. It does, but one need not look beyond Rishi Sunak and Barack Obama to realize relation between class and race is on the way to being decoupled. And curiously, CCP seems to believe Japanese and Koreans are of the same ethnic stock as Chinese? Like the Aryan race pseudoscience, that is not only nonsensical, but also dangerous. Maybe there is a bit of subconscious sense of inferiority and insecurity going on that compels them to tie everything back to ethnicity when forced into the defensive? Also, it betrays how badly CCP is stuck in WW2. “Asia for Asians” was *our* line back in the day. Hakko Ichiu and all that. While Japan was rampaging across their country nominally in the name of the welfare of greater Asia, China was badly owned and raped by not only Japan but most of the world, KMT was carrying out all the fighting that mattered, and CCP was literally a bunch of hill bandits radicalized by a political doctrine thought up by a German person. It is entirely understandable that they must have been seething in resentment for decades, “we should have been in the place of Japanese Empire, and we would have done it so much better.” In the end, what CCP wants is a rematch, in its own image. But sadly, the world moved on. It is saddled with new problems requiring non racial axis of cooperation to solve. Like global warming and global depopulation. As tragic as the circumstances may have been, resolving emotional baggage of the CCP has to take a back seat. As for the Japanese government response, I don’t see any new information, so it’s logical to assume nothing will change. We just continue to decouple, and encourage others to take sensible measures to limit risks to their supply chain. China is no longer the largest import source for the USA which is wise of them. Japan is also developing alternative sources of Galium. And we continue to regret and apologize unreservedly for any trauma caused from the last war. We really do feel bad about this. The best atonement we can offer is to do everything in our power to prevent a catastrophic “rematch.” [LINKED_TEXT: What will China's population drop mean for the world?BBC Future answers five key questions about China's recent population decline and what it might mean for global demographic trends.https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230118-is-chinas-population-decline-surprising] [URL: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230118-is-chinas-population-decline-surprising] [LINKED_TEXT: How soon and at what height will China’s economy peak?Estimates vary, depending on assumptions about population, productivity and priceshttps://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak] [URL: https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/11/how-soon-and-at-what-height-will-chinas-economy-peak] [LINKED_TEXT: China’s real estate slump predicted to last for years, threatening to spill into the wider regionGoldman Sachs economists said China's \\"property weakness will likely be a multi-year growth drag\\" for the economy.https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/chinas-property-market-to-see-persistent-weakness.html] [URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/chinas-property-market-to-see-persistent-weakness.html] [LINKED_TEXT: Deflation Looms in China as Rebound Continues to Lose SteamChina’s consumer inflation dropped to a 28-month low of 0%, while decline in producer prices widened in Junehttps://www.wsj.com/articles/deflation-looms-in-china-as-rebound-continues-to-lose-steam-b0d66d7e] [URL: https://www.wsj.com/articles/deflation-looms-in-china-as-rebound-continues-to-lose-steam-b0d66d7e] [LINKED_TEXT: China's youth unemployment hits a fresh record high in May, major data disappointAuthorities have started to loosen monetary policy in a bid to support growth, although broader measures aren't expected until top leaders hold a regular meeting in late July.https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/chinas-youth-unemployment-hits-a-fresh-record-high-in-may-major-data-disappoint.html] [URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/chinas-youth-unemployment-hits-a-fresh-record-high-in-may-major-data-disappoint.html][LINKED_TEXT: Is China investing too much in infrastructure?] [URL: https://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=866788670&Country=China&topic=Economy] [LINKED_TEXT: Inventor of ‘Balance-Sheet Recession’ Says China Is Now in OneChina is falling into a “balance-sheet recession” and needs to ramp up fiscal stimulus quickly to address the challenge, according to the economist who coined the phrase to explain Japan’s descent into stagnation in the 1990s.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner] [URL: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner] [LINKED_TEXT: China’s loss is Vietnam’s gain as clothing exports to US take a hitThe coronavirus, as well as the US-China trade war, boosted Vietnam’s exports of clothing to the US, while China’s market share dropped.https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3096504/china-no-longer-top-clothes-exporter-us-vietnam-gains-market] [URL: https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3096504/china-no-longer-top-clothes-exporter-us-vietnam-gains-market] [LINKED_TEXT: China no longer top exporter to U.S. as trade rift widensMexico and Canada take over amid tariffs and 'friendshoring' https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade/China-no-longer-top-exporter-to-U.S.-as-trade-rift-widens#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FBEIJING%2FNEW%20YORK%20%2D%2D,the%20world's%20two%20biggest%20economies.] [URL: https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade/China-no-longer-top-exporter-to-U.S.-as-trade-rift-widens#%3A~%3Atext%3DWASHINGTON%2FBEIJING%2FNEW%20YORK%20--%2Cthe%20world%27s%20two%20biggest%20economies.]"},{"instruction":"w many times can I refill a plastic bottle of water before it becomes unusable?","output":"An actual narrow mouthed polyester bottle could be used for just straight water for many times (10 or more).

In countries where democratic institutions are strong and independent, Government corruption is low. In countries where leaders are paid a fair wage, legislative corruption is low. In India the executive branch is the all powerful branch and the legislative is only for show when there is no powerful opposition. The Judicial branch is severely gimped by lack of required number of judges. A sufficiently wealthy man can appoint a good lawyer and drag a case - and when a case do reach to a conclusion, it is moved from lower court to district court to high court to Supreme Court. The Police departments suffer from the same lack of manpower and on top that, the threat of punishment transfers that await good officers. And don’t get me started on the media. There is little to no independent media in India. The condition has gotten from bad to worse with the advent of cheap internet and social media and now most media companies can’t afford to loose the revenue from Government advertisement - whoever in power that may be. So why Indian has a broken system like this? After independence, being an elected representative was seen as selfless serving of the people. The problem was - this was overemphasized and salaries of Government official and elected representative were kept extremely low. This worked for a short while with idealists and stalwarts. But with representatives elected to be in charge of millions and billions of rupees of taxpayer money, and paid peanuts, things soon went downhill as it was destined to be. With no means to earn a handsome salary commensurate with the responsibility, talented students never got any incentive to become a politician, serve the people honestly and still earn a good salary. At the top half, Indian political landscape was filled with aristocrats looking to safeguard their interests; businessman, landlords and former feudal lords looking to get high on power; dynastic candidates who got elected just because of their surname. At the bottom half, Indian political landscape got filled up by goons and failure cases with aspiration to earn big, quick and easy. Now in any system - forget democracy, if thieves are in charge, would they create a system where thieves can be caught easily and justice is served quickly irrespective of the perpetrators power and status? That is India. It’s high time minimum education, no serious crime charge and high salary start being a thing in Indian political landscape. The late PM of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew was a great advocate of higher pay for Government Servants [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #JyfOJ] . PS - I don’t really give USA as a prime example of an “uncorrupt” country. Yes, people in USA don’t have to pay a bribe here and there to get things done. There is no low level corruption. But at the high level, corruption is essentially legalized. I would love to explain how “lobbying” works, but look it up and you would know the US political system is no white fairy. Essentially, corporation and interest groups lobby publicly for a set of legislation to be passed in their favour even though it might be harmful for the country. Money and favour many be exchanged, but as long as it is public, it is legal. Incidentally India is also trying to move in the same direction, and have a crude system called “Electoral Bonds”. Through electoral bonds any individual or corporation can donate money to any political party. However, “electoral bonds” is even worse, since the donor can remain anonymous to the general public and only revealed to Election Commission/Supreme Court. This is however legal in India and not classified as bribery. At the public level though - India of today is not much different than India of 5, 10, 20, or 50 years back.

From the near tropical southern border with India, steep slopes climb to snow-capped heights of over 24,750 feet / 7,500m at the northern border with Tibet. Consequently, temperatures vary greatly between day and night and at different altitudes, so layered clothing for changed conditions, is recommended. From mid-May to the end of Aug, the weather is warm at night (60-64F/ 17-18C) and in the day (72-78F/22-26C). In winter, the sky is bright and it is sunny but cold, especially when the sun hides behind the mountains in the morning and evenings. At night, the temperature falls below zero in winter months. Spring and Autumn are very pleasant with comfortable day’s temperature and cool nights. Basically, Bhutan is a year-round destination with pleasant summer, relatively cold winter but with blue sky & sunny days and refreshing monsoon. The monsoon usually arrives by mid-June and lasts till mid-September during which light to heavy rain expected mainly in the late afternoons and evenings but without much impact on a usual cultural tour.

Because of the teacher in space the Challenger launch was shown live in a classrooms all over the country. By the time Columbia happened the Shuttle had been flying for a long time so people were more used to it and were a little more familiar with the fact that it was risky. It also happened 40-some miles over Texas so the bulk of the video was of bright dots in the sky. (There was infrared video from an army helicopter that caught some of the debris just before it landed but I only saw it for the first time this year.)

About 4.5 billion years ago, the earth was basically molten rock. It began cooling, which took millions of years. The conditions roughly 4 billion years ago were not the same as now, and, neither were the conditions 3 billion years ago, or 2 billion years ago, or 1 billion years ago, and so forth. There are so many new viruses for example, in the world’s oceans, that we have not been able to keep up… they are immeasurable so for with modern technology. If something were to develop now though it is now in competition with whatever is already here, and, adapted to THESE conditions. The things adapted to the EARLIER conditions, that later conditions were TOO different from, went extinct. So, between completion and changing conditions, any new life would be hard to even notice, given that it would be a slightly more complicated chemical somewhere… that would probably be quickly used as food for something that had a head start on it. :D"},{"instruction":"Which is a better band: Iron Maiden or Judas Priest?","output":"MAIDEN!"},{"instruction":"What is the best way to start learning PHP?","output":"If you are thinking about learning PHP, you will not find a better PHP tutorial.

Certain luxury vehicles have abysmal rates of depreciation exceeding fifty percent in the first four years…. If YOU are of a mind to drive such a vehicle and the lease rate reflects a residual value higher than this then yes leasing it is the better route to buying it. I would however NEVER EVER consider a new vehicle with a high rate of depreciation… These are if they are good cars, vehicles to buy used. Thing is they are not very often good cars.

Should I let him?","output":"One of the answers says, “Don’t make an issue of things that don’t matter.” I totally agree with that. I was dating a woman whose teenage daughter had been in foster care because they had such a difficult relationship. The daughter came back to live with her while we were dating. The mom was very controlling and had to have everything a certain way. One of her rules was that the daughter had to do all her internet cruising in her room. The daughter kept breaking this rule and would cruise on her phone downstairs on the sofa. The mom was so exasperated that her kid could not obey this simple rule, that she complained to me about it. I listened to her vent until she ran out of steam, then replied, “Deborah, your daughter has been gone for a year. She doesn’t want to be isolated in her room, she wants to BE WITH YOU. Why do you care so much where she quietly does her thing? It makes no difference to you, but it makes a big difference to her.” I saw a lightbulb go on in her eyes. I saw her about a week later and she told me her relationship with her daughter had completely changed. Deborah had questioned every one of her own arbitrary rules, and thrown out every one that didn’t matter. The two were much more relaxed. They were talking and watching movies together. Laughing and enjoying each other’s company. Getting to know each other as people. I give Deborah mad props for being able to let go of her rigid ways in the interest of building a more peaceful relationship with her daughter. She and I broke up after a short fling, but what she learned while we were together probably changed both their lives."},{"instruction":"Can you describe your wholeday routine at an IIT/NIT?","output":"oWhen students prepare for JEE, then their teacher says that “ Beta bas IIT Nikal lo, phir padhai Nahi Karni padegi “.

But generally it would only be done with obsolete tanks, as new-builds would be very expensive. For example, a modern M1 tank costs several million dollars, of which quite a bit will have gone on the gun, targeting systems and armour. By comparison a concrete bunker will probably cost tens of thousands; some concrete, some steel and the labour and machinery to build it. In contemporary warfare the immobile turret would also be highly vulnerable - a bunker can be camouflaged to make it near invisible to most sensors, and a tank can move away - an emplaced turret can do neither.

In fact, shells of mammals, corals, bones, and even plant matter etc. settle in water basins. In the course of time, this is compressed into a solid material we call calcareous. If conditions are correct, the rock beneath the earth will be heated and compressed, where it will turn into marble. Because much of the composition of marble is calcite, it reacts with acids like lemon, vinegar, tomato, some cleaning agents, etc. [LINKED_TEXT: Galaxy Marmo] [URL: http://www.galaxymarmo.com/] has a vast array of marble, stone, granite and other architectural surfaces that extend through an enormous variety.

Here are 5 reasons to lease vs buy a car: Car leasing gets a bad rap, probably because it’s not car buying. We’ve been trained to buy and own things, especially big-ticket items like homes and cars. For many people, big-ticket items are investments that are intended to last for a long time. You buy a home so you have a literal home base to come back to and hope that your property appreciates in value. When you buy a car, you don’t expect the value of a car to go up, but you do buy a car. You buy it so you can get from point A to point B. The math of car ownership doesn’t work in the same way that home ownership does. So what? For a group of thoughtful, smart, and--yes, conservative--people, the calculus has shifted more toward leasing instead of buying their cars. Their reasons are personal, financial, and even social. Read on and find out if you might be one of those people. Choice and Flexibility [caption id=\\"attachment_1348\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"560\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software] [URL: http://canva.com/][/caption] We’re living in a golden age of choice and flexibility. You can choose to pursue different paths in your career--why not go from accounting to marketing if you can break in? You can change your life and easily find the resources that’ll help you do it--so you want to live and work in Croatia? Here’s a list of resources for expats, complete with stories of how they put together their lives and a list of links to other useful resources that were helpful to them along the way. If you’re resourceful, you can even leapfrog between important relationships, whether those relationships are personal or professional — hello, Tinder and Bumble Bizz. The choices that are available to us give us flexibility, time, and freedom, and the people who take full advantage of that flexibility optimize the parts of their lives where it’s easy and cost-effective trade money for flexibility. Leasing a car is not a long-term commitment. The reasons for not committing to something long-term varies from person to person, but not wanting to commit to a single car that continuously depreciates and needs increasing maintenance over time means needing more flexibility, from (relative) freedom from maintenance costs to the ability to trade in a car for a different one at the end of a lease term. For people who value flexibility, leasing a car can be a strong lifestyle choice as well as a philosophical one. Maintenance [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"631\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: NerdWallet: Get more from your money] [URL: http://nerdwallet.com/][/caption] Leasing a car will help you save time and money on maintenance. Newer cars simply don’t need as much upkeep as an aging one. If you decide that leasing a car makes sense for you and your life, you have access to a car and can simply use it for the things you want and need to do. Take the example of Chris, who recently had to take his car to the dealership for maintenance. One visit soon turned into four as the time and money that needed to go into his car mounted. Craig, another car owner, wanted to get new tires for his car, but each time he has turned up at the shop, the wait time was 90 minutes to two hours. So far, Craig has decided against waiting his turn and aims to visit at a time when the wait time would be shorter. In the meantime, he’s been to the garage twice. Hopefully, the third time can be the charm. Don't Fret About Maintenance Costs Now think about someone who has decided to squeeze more flexibility (that word again) out of their life by leasing a car. The maintenance costs should be low. After all, leased cars are generally new, and new cars typically don’t need much maintenance. Chances are there wouldn’t be the need to take the car in for tire changes either--leased cars typically get driven 10,000-12,000 miles per year, and modern tires are meant to withstand 50,000-60,000 miles of driving. Take into account a typical lease term of 3 years (or 30,000-36,000 miles), and the tires will still be going strong by the end of the lease. If you’re someone who optimizes your life and your time, leasing a car can help buy back some of your time and mental energy. This should free you up to enjoy your hobbies, spend time with the people you care about and do great work in your career. Leasing a car can be one an almost pure way of making sure that your car is serving you and not the other way around. And if you want to make sure you’re doing everything in a cost-effective way, think about... Lower Monthly Payments [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"638\\"] IMAGE C/O TIM MCALPINE OF IT’S A MONEY THING[/caption] If you’re the type who pays for your cars in cash, congratulations. You are much more liquid and adult than some of us are. For everyone else, if you’re not going to put an ungodly number of miles on a car, you should end up paying somewhat less per month to lease your car than if you were making car payments on the same car as an owner. (For a definition of “ungodly number of miles,” look at a few lease options. Most lease agreements want you to drive no more than 10,000-12,000 miles a year before additional mileage fees kick in.) On top of making lower monthly payments to drive the same (late-model) car, leasing a car usually means that your monthly costs of having a car are predictable and controlled (you’re not driving crazy distances above the annual mileage limits you agreed on in your lease, right? Right?). This means no nasty surprise repairs (for a refresher, visit the last section on how maintenance needs are fewer for leased cars) and a car that already performs pretty well because it’s relatively new. If you like to pay less money per month to drive the same car--whether you’re driving it for work or yourself--leasing could be an option that gets you peace of mind around your money and logistics. And speaking of saving money... Tax Benefits [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"684\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: http://TimeSheets.com] [URL: http://timesheets.com/][/caption] Ah, the tax code. Unless you’re a tax attorney or an accountant, chances are you’re not jumping for joy to talk about taxes. But if you lease a car or are thinking about leasing one, here are a few key things to know about the tax code. It could benefit you. Using a Leased Car for Business If you’re using your leased car at least partially for work, you can get a tax break. You may know that companies get tax breaks on their leased vehicles. Thank you, business-friendly tax incentives. What you may not know is that you can get tax breaks on your leased car as an individual. In general, some portion of the total amount you pay on your car lease in a year plus gas and maintenance could be tax deductible. How big that portion is depends on how much of your car use is for personal vs. professional reasons. This means you’ll need to track your car usage. For instance, if you use your leased car for work 60% of the time, 60% of the total expenses for your car for the year are tax deductible. Using a Leased Car While You Are Self-Employed If you’re self-employed, you can deduct the business-related expenses related to your car by using what’s called a standard mileage rate. You can choose to use the standard mileage rate for your deductions in your first year. If you do that, you must stick with using the standard mileage rate for your deductions for the duration of your lease. The standard mileage rate was 53.5 cents per mile in 2017 and 54.0 cents per mile in 2016. You can also deduct business-related parking fees and tolls, but the tax code changes regularly, so consult a tax accountant so you don’t make any assumptions. If you’re self-employed, talk to your accountant to figure out the best approach for you so you can start tracking your usage. If you’re already using your car for work and work for an employer, your employer might be able to connect you to a resource who could talk to you about your taxes. Look for an in-house tax expert, someone in-house who could connect you to an outside resource, or find a tax expert through your EAP (employee assistance provider)--usually outsourced to a third party. Depending on the plan, those experts could be free to you. Don't Miss Tax Breaks from Owning a Car If you’re worried about missing out on tax breaks by leasing instead of buying a car, don’t worry. There are opportunities for deductions. Take a moment to grieve the depreciation deduction--you don’t own it, you can’t deduct the depreciation--and celebrate not owning a car that’s losing value. If tax considerations were standing between you and a decision to lease a car that could make your life easier and more stylish, Worry less andDon’t think so much about the tax code. Go live your life! Meanwhile, more of your thoughtful peers are leasing cars instead of buying them because of...

Technology has helped us do everything from posting photos of our dinner to finding an apartment. Of course it would play a role in helping us easily lease cars too. The traditional car leasing experience involves visiting multiple dealerships and talking to leasing agents until you find one who gives you a rate that you like on a car that you like. Then, you agree to let them run a credit check on you and wait to find out if you’re still a good candidate in their eyes and whether you’ll be able to keep the rate that you like. Want to Find Advice Online? If you’re not a fan of legwork, you might like working with a platform like [LINKED_TEXT: The Car You Desire, Delivered. – Carlease.com] [URL: http://carlease.com/]. You don’t need to personally visit dealerships (unless you’re extremely hands-on), you can talk to their unbiased advisors who have no skin in the game whether you lease a run-of-the-mill sedan or a souped-up luxury car. Plus, the platform helps you gather bids from banks who want your business. Platforms like [LINKED_TEXT: Carlease.com] [URL: https://carlease.com/] do what technology does best: it helps minimize or eliminate legwork and gathers data from multiple sources (e.g. different rates and bids) to help users (that’s you) make the best decision. New platforms will even help you swap out your lease if you need to end it early. Technology at work! If you’re the kind of person who’s comfortable using technology to make your life run more smoothly and easily--to save yourself some work--it’s never been easier to lease a car without doing a bunch of research first. And in case you had other questions about the smart, thoughtful people who are leasing their cars, just look at… (Bonus:) Our Changing Culture [caption id=\\"\\" align=\\"alignnone\\" width=\\"600\\"] Image c/o [LINKED_TEXT: Let TOAD Create or Reskin Your Next Great Mobile Game] [URL: http://toappdevelop.com/][/caption] Have you looked around and seen your Facebook feed lately? Ever see ads for subscription boxes? Ever see posts about interesting products, activities, or ideas that came through a subscription service? We’re living in a culture of sampling and subscribing. Because of considerations around choice, costs, convenience, and the technological ability to make it happen, we’re now able to sample and subscribe to a huge variety of products, from the completely necessary to the silly and just-for-fun. Here are some of the things you can subscribe to and sample: Razors. Pretty necessaryClothes. Convenient and cost-effective, especially if you like designer dudsChildren’s toys/activity packs. Convenient, fun, and packs the excitement of receiving something unknown every monthRecords. Like giving yourself a surprise present once a month, but with music on vinylJapanese snacks. Strictly fun for most people. Deadly-serious and necessary for people who love Japan or are obsessed with exotic snacks In fact, the futurists at Ford--people whose main work is to talk about trends that’ll guide us into the next x years--wrote about sampling and living smarter as ongoing social trends in their most recent report. This idea of “living smarter” is what drives thoughtful people to subscribe to services and subscription boxes that can streamline and enrich their lives. At its root, smarter living is what drives the decision to lease instead of buying a car. Leasing a car is simply subscribing to a (new and cool-to-you) car. Smarter Living, Smarter Leasing For many smart, conservative people who are thoughtful about their decisions, leasing a car is the way to go. In a life that could involve demanding careers, busy families, and too little time to spend on hobbies and friends, taking back your time and mental energy by controlling your monthly spending on having access to a late-model car, not worrying about maintenance, taking advantage of the flexibility it gives you--all while deducting relevant expenses from your tax bill--could be the most conservative financial and lifestyle decision. Whether or not leasing a car is right for you, you need to make the right decision for your life. So look at the factors that matter most to you and use that to guide your decision.

Keep your spirits high.I have no idea about the rest companies."},{"instruction":"w do I create my own mailing address?","output":"To create your own mailing address follow the following steps: Back in the day, AOL had a cool service that let you create a custom domain email address for free and you could use any domain name you wanted, even if it was already registered. I have no idea how it worked, but it was gone after a short while and I can see why! You can still create a personalized email address, but it’s not possible without paying. The reason for that is because you need to first purchase a domain name in order to setup the email for that domain. So in order to get a personalized domain email address, you first have to register a domain. This also means that you are limited in what your “personalized” email address can be. If a domain is already registered, you won’t be able to buy it and therefore won’t be able to send email via that domain name. Of course, if you really wanted to send an email from any email address, you could create your own email server and send out fake emails, but then you would be a certified hacker/spammer and we’re not going to teach anything like that in this article. So let’s break the process up into parts and hopefully you can find the domain you’re looking for. You’ll probably get what you want if you’re looking to send emails for a wedding or something similar and want to create a custom email like [LINKED_TEXT: invite@jackandkelly.com] [URL: mailto:invite@jackandkelly.com] or [LINKED_TEXT: gettingmarried@wendyandchris.com] [URL: mailto:gettingmarried@wendyandchris.com]. If you’re looking to send email from [LINKED_TEXT: tomandkate@love.com] [URL: mailto:tomandkate@love.com], you’re going to be out of luck because [LINKED_TEXT: Brand Love - Oath] [URL: http://love.com/] is definitely already registered. Find a Domain First, let’s look for a domain that is available. Remember, that the email doesn’t have to always end in .COM either. Recently, a whole slew of new top-level domains were opened up, which means you can have a domain that ends in things like .fitness or .investments or .photography. The best site I like to use for searching for domains is [LINKED_TEXT: Cheap Domain Names - Buy Domain Names from 0.88 - Namecheap] [URL: http://namecheap.com/]. It lets you search for a keyword and then will give you all the options you could possibly imagine for that keyword. Click Search and you’ll see four tabs across the top: Popular, New, International and Favorites. In the example below, I search for jackandkate to see what was available. Unfortunately, [LINKED_TEXT: jack and kate coming soon] [URL: http://jackandkate.com/] and .net are not available, but others like .rocks and .me are! jackandkate.rocks actually sounds pretty cool. If you were to send an email, it would be something like wedding@jackandkate.rocks. The part before the @ symbol can be anything you want. You can scroll down and click the See other options link to see other available options for that domain name. Also, some of them have a little lightning icon next to the name and if you hover over it, it will tell you the restriction for that domain name. For example, if you want [LINKED_TEXT: http://jackandkate.ca] [URL: http://jackandkate.ca/], you’ll need to have Canadian residence in order to get it. If none of those suit your fancy, click on the New tab and it’ll show you the options available with all the new top-level domains. You’ll notice immediately that these are also a lot more expensive than the traditional ones. Once you find a domain you are happy it, purchase it and then read on to the next section, which will show you how to set up your email using NameCheap also. Actually, read the section below before buying the domain from NameCheap because you can add 2 free months of email hosting when checking out. Setup Email Hosting When you are purchasing your domain, you’ll see the option to add email hosting on NameCheap and what I really love is that it’s free for 2 months! For most people, you might only need the email address for a couple of weeks while sending invitations, etc. If you need it for longer, it’s very cheap email hosting. Go ahead and click the add to cart button for the free private email and it will bring you to another page where you can choose the email addresses you would like. By default, it gives you one email address for free which starts with [LINKED_TEXT: admin@whateveryourdomain.com] [URL: mailto:admin@whateveryourdomain.com]. However, you can just uncheck that and check the custom blank box at the bottom and that will become your free one. If you want more than one custom email address with that domain, it’ll be 0.25 per email address. Now just follow through the checkout process, during which you’ll have to create an account. Once you’re done, click on the Manage Account button or go back to the homepage and click Sign In. Once you are logged in, go to the Dashboard and you’ll see a whole bunch of links. The one you want to click on is Open-Xchange Email domains. Now you will see the domain name listed and you have to click on that. If you bought more than one domain, you have to select the domain you want to manage email for. Now in order to get your email setup, you first have to create the mailbox. I thought that it would do that on its own since I had typed in the custom domain name I wanted, but apparently, you have to do it manually. Go ahead and click on the Setup New Mailbox button. Type in the local part of the email address you would like, then give your mailbox a password and then click the Create Mailboxes button. On the next page, click the Proceed button. Finally, click on the Subscription Management button to get back to the main email screen. Finally, you’ll see it gives you the URL for managing your email. By default, this will just be mail.domainname.whatever. So since my domain is aseemkishore.rocks, I would go to mail.aseemkishore.rocks to manage my email. It’s worth noting that when you click that link, you might get an error page and that’s because if you just registered the domain, the DNS settings have to propagate across the Internet and that can take up to 48 hours. In my case, it only took about 30 minutes and then it was redirecting to the email client. However, if you want immediate access, the link should be in the Private Email email that you get from NameCheap. Here’s the URL for managing email if you can’t find it: [LINKED_TEXT: https://privateemail.com/appsuite/signin] [URL: https://privateemail.com/appsuite/signin] Now you have to log in using the email address you just created and the password you just set for that mailbox. My username is support@aseemkishore.rocks in my example. Don’t use the login info for your NameCheap account as that won’t work. Once you’re in, you’ll see the interface for the email client used by NameCheap. It’s got a clean interface and works perfectly fine for most purposes. Now to send your first email, just click the Compose link and send away! I sent an email to my Gmail account and it came through in a few seconds just fine. The great thing about NameCheap is that it also supports IMAP, so you can use Outlook or whatever email client you want to manage your email. They also have the option to forward all the email from that account to another one if you like. So that’s all there is to it! It’s a bit of a process and it will take you about an hour to do all of this, but if you really want a personalized email address, this is really the only way to go about it. Of course, you can register your domain anywhere and there are hundreds of email hosting companies, but I just recommend NameCheap because I think it gives you the best value for the price and it’s very easy to use.

I would compare it to a language. If you were to hear someone speaking Russian on the radio and had no previous knowledge of the Russian language, you would definitely not understand what was being said. However, the actual sound of the language to your ears might be pleasing, or it might not. If you kept listening day in day out to this radio station that only spoke Russian, you might eventually start picking up on words here and there and start to understand what they mean. The sound of the language is starting to have a new meaning to you, a truer, deeper meaning. As time goes by and the weeks past, you now start to pick up on short phrases. As the radio plays, you understand little bits of what is being said. As the months pass by and you get more and more drawn in to this new language full of intricacies, you start to get more and more interested in it. You might even start to study the language to try and understand more of what is being said. Eventually, after months of daily listening to the Russian radio station, you now understand nearly all of what is being said and the sound of the language has a completely different meaning to you because you can understand what is being said and communicated. When you decide to fly over to Russia for a vacation, you can understand any type of sentence coming from anyone even though all of them speak in different ways and do not speak exactly the same way because they are using the common Russian language. You could compare all of the different ways everyone in Russia speaks Russian to jazz improvisation. In jazz, no one improvises exactly the same way but everyone is using a common idiom (compared to Russian here). In Russia, no one speaks the exact same way, they all speak(speaking compared to improvising in jazz) in different ways and create many different sentences that mean different things and transmit different feelings and emotions. In both jazz and Russian, there is a common language that needs to be understood before understanding people speaking the language and before the overall sound of the idiom has a deeper meaning to you. Once you grasp onto this idiom and understand it, a whole new world opens up and you realize just how much of a genius the great speakers of the Russian language (great jazzmen) were and just how much they knew. Before any prior knowledge of the Russian language, however, you could not understand why these so called great Russian speakers on the radio were so good and why they were looked upon with so much admiration by all other Russian speakers (all other understanders of the jazz idiom). You could not understand why these great Russian speakers were any greater than the normal Russian speakers. It had the same overall sound to your ears and while you could enjoy this sound maybe five minutes, after that it became unpleasant and you would just get annoyed at yourself for not understanding what was so great about it, and why these certain Russian speakers were greater than others. Another very good comparison to make to jazz is Chinese writing. If you were to look at Chinese writing for the first time without any prior knowledge of the Chinese language, you would dismiss it as being just random lines on a piece of paper that have no meaning (you could compare this to people saying jazz is just random notes). You might acknowledge that the forms of the lines and their arrangement on the paper is beautiful and might look at one page for one minute, but would definitely not spend hours looking at books full of Chinese writings (you might acknowledge that the overall, general sound of jazz is beautiful, but would definitely not spend hours upon hours listening to these random notes which are noise to your ear). You cannot understand why so many people are reading books and books of Chinese writings that are hundreds of pages long. You think the books are full of random scribbles and unless you make an effort to understand the language by studying or listening to it, you will always be left in the dark about what is so great about this whole world of Chinese writings. You are missing out on thousands and thousands of stories and emotions that would get to you through the reading of the books if you understood the language. You are missing out on a whole new world that would bring you much joy if you were to understand it. If you open yourself up to it and spend time and effort to try to understand it, even though the first months are torturous and you are forcing yourself to try to understand jazz, eventually you will start to pick up on the jazz idiom (language) and a whole new world will open up to you. It is a world full of stories that will transmit all types of emotions, anywhere from sadness to unbelievable happiness and everything in between."},{"instruction":"what ways was Christianity morally superior to the paganism it replaced?","output":"None at all.

In the 1990 MIT students took over 400,000 in one weekend out of the casinos in Las Vegas,\\" says Gordon Adams, a casino security investigator. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #PLQEA] In Las Vegas, the house always wins — unless you're a math whiz from MIT. Through the years, a group of math students at the world-famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology has focused their considerable brain power on a very extracurricular activity: gambling — specifically blackjack. The students realized that blackjack was the only beatable game in casino gambling — and beat it they did. By the 1990s, the team — whose membership rotated over the years — was making regular trips to Las Vegas and winning big. The team used a method known as card-counting, which helps players predict when the cards being dealt will be favorable to them. By knowing which cards have been spent and which ones remain in the shoe, savvy players can keep a running \\"count\\" which works as a rough predictor of how many high cards are left. High cards work to a player's benefit because they boost the odds that they will beat the dealer. The MIT players were not the first to count cards. But they used their math expertise — and advanced computer models — to hone their skills to a devastatingly effective science. They wrote computer programs to devise the best strategy for specific situations, then updated their data with real-life experience. \\"After a trip to Vegas, we would enter all the information about what happened into the computers,\\" remembers Semyon Dukach, a student who was a member of the team in the early 1990s. New members of the team were \\"trained\\" for weeks or months, starting on MIT's Cambridge, Mass., campus, then getting experience in backroom card games in Boston's Chinatown. Then they would be sent to Vegas, where they would start out as a \\"mule\\" carrying cash, then work their way up in the team's hierarchy. The team visited Las Vegas regularly, peaking in the 1990s with trips nearly every weekend. When they hit a casino, they would first deploy a counter to sit in on a table and track the cards. When the counter calculated that the high cards were coming up, he or she would secretly signal the team's designated \\"big bettor\\" to the table, using code words to signal how \\"positive\\" the shoe was. The big bettor would then start wagering large amounts of money until the counter would signal that the shoe was no longer \\"hot.\\" Other games such as Slot machines are random, Roullette is about probability & Poker is about bluffing. Card counting isnt illegal but Casinoes ask you to leave casino if you are found “Counting Card” or make the rules difficult so Counting wont help. Most important aspect of Gambling is being Random, winners are chosen Randomly there’s no Sequence where else Mathematics is about probability based on Numbers Sequencing. Mathematics cant predict random numbers otherwise not only Las Vegas but all Casinoes would have been destroyed by Mathematacians around the Globe.

Only Pakistan and Great Britain ever recognized the annexation, with Britain withdrawing its recognition after the UN rejection. At the time, there was no concept of “Palestinians”, nor would there be until the first Palestinian National Charter in 1964. That charter specifically waived the Palestinian claim on the West Bank, eastern Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip: “Article 24: This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area. Its activities will be on the national popular level in the liberational, organizational, political and financial fields.” [LINKED_TEXT: Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations] [URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20140806011135/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/12363;jsessionid=293C499750EF77F0019ADF7A3D04A9C8] Apparently, as long as the areas were under Arab control, they weren’t “Palestinian territory”."},{"instruction":"What is wrong with my washing machine?

They are excellent at hunting, in fact they are nature’s best hunter, and as every living creature, they still have a strong instinct, yes, it does include human too.The same way some people can’t stop themselves from committing sexual abuse because they can’t fight their urge (which is reproduction instinct, instinct isn’t an autopilot or a list of rules you know, it is how you are emotionally pushed into some behaviors), cats that still have their hormones telling them that they need to breed, own a territory and manage it will want to do it. Unlike what many say, cats are really loving their owners, they are just showing it on a completely different way than we are used to, but they are still free, as any human, to choose to leave someone, and the same way couples breaks and people cheat on other, cats too can leave you, mainly knowing that their instinct tell them that they do prefer hunting than having easy food, that they need to expand their territory which should be much bigger than your house. Also, to add to that, while cats are vital to human by controlling pest that would ruin human civilization, when they are too numerous, they also cause arm to the ecosystem,sterilizing/neutering your cat is good for him/her as he/she won’t have this uncontrollable urge to reproduce, and it will help to avoid to cause too many stray cats to cause problems while living harsh life. Sources : And having fed a stray pussycat who gave birth to multiple kittens, most died, one of which we were able to adopt, and she is basically traumatized of her life outside and wouldn’t have survived if we didn’t feed her, she also gave birth to 5 kittens before we could take her home, and thankfully all of them have been adopted."},{"instruction":"What are some NLP techniques every data scientist must know?","output":"If you want to learn NLP, I would suggest you to follow Stanford CS224(they released hw and everything), instead of following [LINKED_TEXT: Mike West] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-West-99] links.

There have been a lot of really great college players drafted into the NBA.

Wonder why? Here are a few things I've learned in my 12-year career as a national best-selling author! This graph is the most accurate representation of my journey! Honesty is what people care about! Everyone wants to follow a trend in the chaotic writing industry. Only a few people have the courage and determination to deviate from the status quo and effect change. Often, aspiring writers become entangled in this web. They begin by copying trends and styles that have worked for other well-known authors, and they overlook the most important aspect of writing a book: being unique and true to themselves. So, always write what you want to read, not what you think others will enjoy reading. The most recent book that defied stereotypes is \\"The rudest book ever\\"! 2. Good things take time I see so many young aspiring writers in such a hurry to get published that they neglect to work on laying the foundation. Making mistakes and learning from them is the one unchanging rule of writing a book. When you write draft after draft of the same story, you realise how much more there is to explore than you initially began with. As you write more, you should try out different writing styles and concentrate more on character and plot development. Every author dreams of being a sensation overnight, but they forget even JK Rowling was rejected 12 times before becoming one of the most celebrated authors of all time. So, Always remember even overnight success can take years to achieve. 3. Increase your knowledge This point cannot be emphasised enough. Reading extensively will increase your vocabulary, and once you begin to read attentively, you will start to notice writing styles, sentence formation, and basic writing structure in every book you pick. Reading more also aids in the development of new ideas and the overall shaping of the existing plotline. If you're perplexed, read to clear your mind, and when you're bursting at the seams, write! 4. Be comfortable with Criticism I've always admired my friends' ability to be objective critics of my work. When I first started writing, they read my work on a regular basis, praised me, but also suggested a few changes. Their feedback assisted me in reworking areas where I lacked as well as gaining a reader's perspective. There were times when I wrote something I was extremely proud of but they didn't find it as exciting, but I always made sure to take something constructive from it and improve my work. Take note: Choose people who will give you honest feedback and can point you in the right direction. 5. Practice writing Just write, and keep writing. Even on days where you feel like skipping, write at least a paragraph or sentence. It can be completely different from your story but it will help keep up the habit. Once you develop the habit of writing every day, you will never feel tired of rewriting drafts after drafts of your book. Don't try to replicate things; instead, create a habit that leads to the desired outcome. Want to write to me?

Poor posture: Poor posture can put unnecessary strain on the various structures of the spine and result in back pain over time. Bulging Discs: Discs act as shock absorbers to reduce stress on your spine and are located between your bony vertebrae. Disc injuries are common. They can appear as a result of sudden movements or from long-term postural stress, cause inflammation and pain, and in extreme cases can irritate nearby spinal nerves. This can cause radiating leg pain, tingling and numbness (often misdiagnosed as sciatica). Facet joint sprains: Each of your vertebrae is connected to a vertebra above and below by two joints called facet joints, which can be sprained, as can your ankle if you move awkwardly. As with a sprained ankle, if the facet joints become inflamed, you will experience back pain and limited range of motion. Sciatica: Sciatica is the Latin word for \\"pain in the back of the leg.\\" Sciatica refers to pain usually caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve in the lower back. The sciatic nerve runs from the lower back, down the back of the thigh and calf, and into the foot. When compressed, the sciatic nerve can cause lower back pain that may radiate to the leg or buttocks. It can also cause tingling, numbness, muscle spasms, reduced flexibility and weakness. There are several more serious reasons for lower back pain, such as disc injury, fracture, cancer, and infection. If you are suffering from sciatica or lower back pain then I have a unique solution which is to use the Acu-hump Sciatica Massager. Acu-hump sciatica stretcher is a portable and ergonomic glute massager tool. It is designed to mimic a chiropractor’s fingers, and it can be used to apply pressure points therapy on the affected area that allows you to self massage deep tissue.

Doflamingo is the literal embodiment of what a villain is. He doesn’t have any tragic backstory or reason for what he does he just does it because he wants to be in control. He wants everything to go his way and he would do anything to do so. In the one piece manga there’s something known as a “warlord” which is a pirate who has a contract working with the government. The marines have to choose who they want as a warlord however doflamingo tricked the government into becoming one. What did he do with that power? He tricked the rightful king of a country known as “dressrosa” into killing his own people. Why? Because he wanted to enslave the people of the country. He entered the kings room one night and told him he would die if he didn’t hand over all of his, and his citizens money. The king begged the citizens, who were mostly poor, for their money and they gave it to him because they trusted him. However when the king went out in public to ask and beg for their money doflamimgo quite literally used him as a puppet. There’s another thing in one piece called “devil fruits” and doflamingos devil fruit is known as the “ito ito no mi”. He can attach strings to things and even use them as weapons using this devil fruit power, so while the king was in public he attached a string to him and forced him to slaughter his own people. No one knew this was really the work of doflamingo besides one soldier known as kyros. Kyros did everything in his power to stop doflamingo but in the end got his leg cut off and got cursed to where everyone forgot him. Eventually doflamingo knocks the king out and everyone sees him as a hero. Doflamingo became the new king in his “heroic” act. 10 years later the main character of the manga comes around and sets free doflamingos slaves, which angers him. Because of this he set his entire island inside of what he called the “bird cage” which was really his strings that were strong enough to cut a canon ball apart. While everyone was trapped in here he manipulated all of them the same way he did with the king 10 years ago. Throughout the 10 years he was king he murdered and raped innocent citizens without anyone else knowing, why? Because he set the same curse on them he did with the kings bet soldier."},{"instruction":"What's your favourite British myth or legend?","output":"King Arthur and the round table. This has recently been discussed again due to the discovery that the blue stones at Stonehenge were originaly part of a much older Welsh stone circle, before being moved to its current site. This was discovered in Waun Mawn, in West Wales. This was proven because a specific blue stone with an unusual shape at the bottom fitted perfectly into one of the ghost holes in Wales, and the blue stone (which can have different minerals depending on where it was mined) matched perfectly with remnants left in the pits when they were removed. Much speculation has been made about why they were moved. Was it because of unification of people, and the discovery of a special new site with natural earth markings aligned with the solstice? (Chalk grooves in the earth left after the last ice age, discovered in recent years, pointing towards the ‘entrance’ of Stonehenge). Or, were they stolen and taken to the new site because of their special significance? The oldest stories about King Arthur (900 years old) talk about Merlin leading men to Ireland to capture a magical stone circle and bringing it back to England as a monument to the dead. This part of Wales was considered part of Ireland at the time. Coincidence? This story was always discounted, but it does make you think. Our ancient past was taught through oral history. When things were later written down it was done by the monks in Churches, and were then destroyed by Vikings, so we lost those links to our past. However, that oral history could still have been passing down the stories, eventually leading to that story from 900 years ago being written down. We will never know, but it is interesting when archeology matches with a myth."},{"instruction":"What is wrong with my washing machine?

However back to your question assuming the attacker knew his stuff and failed all your brake hydraulics. This leaves you with only the hand brake to slow the car down by brakes. If this was cut then no direct braking available. To slow the vehicle in this situation selecting the lowest possible gear whilst keeping the engine going you will have to initially raise engine speed dramatically, to have a chance of getting the lowest possible forward gear. Keep your feet off the accelerator from now on . Assuming the handbrake still works, a combination of low gears If speed allows you to get them and application of handbrake if working. , Do not touch the accelerator provided you are not going down a steep hill the vehicle should be losing speed now. From now on the only way of slowing to a stop is to switch off the engine whilst still in the lowest gear you can select. Care is needed now, as the steering lock might be activated so switch to aux ( engine off position ) . Now you should have lost a lot speed and can decide if it is safe to shut the engine off completely. The car should, slow to a stop as there is no power and the dead engine will act as a brake.

The key to mitigating this risk lies in diversification, which involves spreading your investments across various asset classes. By doing so, you reduce the impact of poor performance from a single investment on your overall portfolio. For steady, long-term gains, consider including stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investment instruments in your portfolio. Harness the Power of Compound Interest In the realm of finance, few forces rival the potency of compound interest. This phenomenon allows your money to grow exponentially over time. By reinvesting your earnings, you generate additional returns on your initial investment. Embrace this strategy early on, and even small amounts can metamorphose into significant wealth in the long run. Invest in High-Quality Stocks Throughout history, stocks have outperformed many other assets. To capitalize on their potential, seek out well-established companies with strong fundamentals, stable earnings, and a proven history of growth. Prioritize thorough research of the company's financials and industry trends before making your investment. Explore the World of Real Estate Real estate can be an invaluable addition to your investment portfolio. Ownership of property opens doors to rental income and the possibility of appreciation over time. Tailor your choices between residential or commercial properties based on your risk appetite and investment goals.

Government bonds and high-quality corporate bonds are often perceived as safer options, serving as a cushion during market downturns. Tap into the Potential of Mutual Funds and ETFs Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present an opportunity to pool resources with other investors to create a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Their appeal lies in instant diversification and professional management, making them an attractive option for beginners.

Their potential for extraordinary returns intrigues many investors, but they also come with high volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Exercise caution and only invest what you can afford to lose.

Mutual funds or ETFs are excellent choices as they offer instant diversification and require minimal investment knowledge. 2: How Much Should I Invest in Stocks?

Generally, experts recommend allocating around 60% to 70% of your portfolio to stocks for long-term growth. 3: Are Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) a Good Option? Yes, REITs offer a viable option for investors seeking exposure to real estate without direct property ownership. They provide dividends to shareholders and a chance to benefit from real estate assets. 4: Should I Invest in International Markets? Investing in international markets adds diversification to your portfolio but comes with additional risks, including currency fluctuations and geopolitical factors. 5: What Are the Risks of Cryptocurrency Investment? Cryptocurrency investment carries substantial risks due to its high volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Invest only what you can afford to lose. 6: How Can I Minimize Investment Risks? To minimize risks, follow a diversification strategy.

Once I finally get a hold on the clean up another storm comes through and puts limbs and trees back on the ground. Plus the lawn care… 30 years ago you could buy a riding mower that was built to last a lifetime. Now they are built to barely get you through one season.

Their sales are doing fine. I observe that Input surfaces seem to work best when they are horizontal and displays seem to work best when they are vertical. (Notice that there are no laptops with horizontal screens and vertical keyboards.) When iPads and Microsoft Surfaces are used at 45°, both input and output are comfortable on the same surface—so they have touch screens. However, when people use them vertically as displays, they tend to touch them less and add keyboards because holding your arms out horizontally for a long time is very tiring. That is probably why Apple makes keyboards for iPads but does not make touch screens for laptops. Back in iPod days, a lot of people wondered why iPods didn't include FM radios. After all, Zune did, and we know what a competitive edge that gave Zune—if you can even remember what a Zune was. Customers were noisy enough that Apple did come out with an FM radio accessory for the iPod, but it wasn’t popular and it faded from the market without anyone noticing. Feel free to diagnose me as weird, but I think computer manufacturers put touch screens in laptops for bragging rights—hey, we have this neat feature that Apple doesn’t have! The people who want touch-screen laptops are vocal, but they are not creating a stampede away from Apple that would cause Apple to change their product."},{"instruction":"What is the string theory about?","output":"I am a cave man, I have not studied Earth physics that much as yet. But, I have gained little ability to enter different dimensions around us which other writers are discussing here. I goal has been Enlightenment and creating healing technology, therefore i have different point of view. I have just finished watching, Big bang theory, so in that sitcom, a string theory has been discussed a lot, so I did my research on string theory as a cave man. If you did not understand anything said above by other physics scholars I can give you some food for mind through which you can explore string theory on your own. I was travelling and somebody explained me “ String theory like this” he called String theory as Shoe String theory, alright, I made sense of his hypothesis like this, your strings of both shoes are connected in some different dimensions. Which can also be known as Astral Dimensions by a Spiritual Scientist With these eyes we can only see this Physical Dimension,( but when you open your third eye you can enter other Astral Dimensions) there are other dimensions which are less solid than this physical reality where we spend 16 hours a day, if we are sleeping for 8 hours and we enter dream based dimensions, I think you get to experince other dimensions them in sci-fi and superheroes movies. Which which they travel in different times, future or past events. So, shoe strings of your left shoe is connected with the right shoe strings in some different dimension. In spiritual Scriptures they spoke about that we are all one, connected with some invisible threads, individuality is a myth, here I suppose that; Spiritual people have entered these dimensions in their meditation and gathered this information from there where everything is connected with everything through these strings. They called the connectors as love (true love feeling). Healers has different point of view, if they see somebody sick and sufferring too much, they know for sure, that the persons Strings got raptured due to some traumatic incident, so he enters other dimensions and with his intention powers he repairs those broken strings and person is healthy again. Moving to Mr. TESLA I think he entered these dimensions also, his point of view was different, he saw unlimited energy surrounding these strings and he thought of harvesting and transferring those energy to full fill human's insatiable desire for energy in this Dimension. I suppose that's how he thought about transferring current or electricity around without any wires, I think through those strings which connects everything with everything like a membrane in other dimensions. (We need that technology now). I think deep understanding of “String Theory” clearly can bring huge transcending evolution to humanity. Or by evolving our beliefs about life can bring more understanding about String theory. It's a life's saviour theory, I think was solved by Mr.Tesla, either people who got hold of it did not understand it because if their limiting belief system or they want to keep this planet on status quo. I believe they did not understand it clearly, that's why it's not out and helping humanity with its energy needs. We are still destroying for our energy needs, when we are all surrounded by inexhaustible energy around us. The Caveman."},{"instruction":"As a crossdresser, do you like satin silk clothes?

Ghatotkacha Ghatotkacha is the son of Bheema and Hidimbhi. On the fourteenth day of the Kurukshetra, the battle continued past sunset. When the bright moon rose, [LINKED_TEXT: Ghatotkach] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatotkacha], son of [LINKED_TEXT: Bhima] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima] slaughtered numerous warriors, attacking while flying in the air. Karna stood against him and both fought fiercely until Karna released the Shakti, a divine weapon given to him by [LINKED_TEXT: Indra] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra]. Ghatotkach increased his size and fell dead on the Kaurav army killing thousands of them. 9. Bheema Bheema is the second of the Pandava brothers. He was known for his macho personality and great power. He killed all the Kaurava brothers including Duryodana. On the 18th day of the battle, when Duryodana ran away from the battlefield and was later found by the Pandavas, he went into a duel with Duryodana and killed him, marking the end of the great battle of Kurukshetra. 8. Drishtadyumna Drishtadyumna is the Commnaner-in-Chief of the Pandava army for all the 18 days of war. He killed Drona and many others in the Kaurava army. After the war is over, Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, and Kritavarma met [LINKED_TEXT: Duryodhana] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duryodhana] at his deathbed and promised to avenge the actions of [LINKED_TEXT: Bhima] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima]. They attacked the Pandavas' camp later that night and killed all the Pandavas' remaining army including [LINKED_TEXT: their children] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upapandavas]. He was slaughtered in that attack. 7. Drona Dronacharya is the teacher of both Kauravas and Pandavas. He taught archery to both Arjuna & Karna and mace fight to both Bheema and Duryodana. After King [LINKED_TEXT: Drupada] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupada] and King [LINKED_TEXT: Virata] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virata] were slain by [LINKED_TEXT: Drona] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drona], [LINKED_TEXT: Bhima] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima], and [LINKED_TEXT: Dhristadyumna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhristadyumna] fought him on the fifteenth day. Because Drona was very powerful and inconquerable having the irresistible brahmadanda, Krishna hinted to Yudhisthira that Drona would give up his arms if his son Ashwathama was dead. Bhima proceeded to kill an elephant named Ashwathama, and loudly proclaimed that Ashwathama was dead. Drona approached Yudhisthira to seek the truth of his son's death. Yudhisthira proclaimed Ashwathama Hatahath, naro va Kunjaro va, implying Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure whether it was a Drona's son or an elephant, The latter part of his proclamation (Naro va Kunjaro va) were drowned out by sound of the conch blown by Krishna. Drona was disheartened, and laid down his weapons. He was then killed by [LINKED_TEXT: Dhristadyumna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhristadyumna] to avenge his father's death and satisfy his vow. 6. Abhimanyu Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna. He heard about the strategies to enter into the Chakra Vyuha when he was in his mother's womb. On the battlefield when the four Pandavas and their allies were finding it impossible to break Dronacharya's \\"Chakra Vyuh\\" formation as Arjuna was busy fighting on the other side of the battlefield, he could not be summoned to break the [LINKED_TEXT: Chakra vyuha] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_Vyuha] formation, which could only be broken by entering and exiting the formation. Yudhisthira instructed, [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu], one of Arjuna's sons to break the Chakra vyuha formation. Abhimanyu knew the secret of entering the Chakra vyuh formation, but did not know how to exit it. [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] slew tens of thousands of warriors. He also killed Dhuryodhana's son and Durmashana who was [LINKED_TEXT: Dushasana] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushasana]'s son. Duryodana ordered his men to attack [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] all at once. [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] fought but was surrounded and killed by many warriors in a combined attack. 5.Ashwathama Ashwatthama was one of the most underrated warrior of the whole Mahabharata. He had many powerful divine weapons like Narayanastra and Agneyastra. He created havoc in Pandava army after the death of his father. He was the sun of guru drona and kripi. He was a ansh of lord Shiva and becomes almost undefeated when he is angry . He was one of the few Maharathis who survived the Mahabharata war . 4. Bhishma Bhishma is the grandfather of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He is the most powerful warrior on the Kauravas side along with Karna. He has been the Commander-in-Chief of the Kaurava army for first 10 days of war. On the tenth day, the Pandavas, unable to withstand Bhishma's prowess, decided to put [LINKED_TEXT: Shikhandi] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhandi], who had been a woman in a prior life in front of Bhishma, as Bhishma has taken a vow not to attack a woman. Shikhandi's arrows fell on Bhishma without hindrance. Arjuna positioned himself behind Shikhandi, protecting himself from Bhishma's attack, and aimed his arrows at the weak points in Bhishma's armour. Soon, with arrows sticking from every part of his body, the great warrior fell from his chariot. His body did not touch the ground as it was held aloft by the arrows protruding from his body. 3. Arjuna Arjuna is the third one of the Pandava brothers. The greatest warrior on the Pandavas' side. He is said to have the greatest sight, fiercest moves and perfect aim in archery. When Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana that he would give the Narayani Sena, to one side, and himself as a non-combatant to the other. When given the choice of either Krishna's army or Krishna Himself on their side, Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas chose Krishna, unarmed on his own, relieving Duryodhana, who thought Arjuna to be the greatest fool. Later Arjuna requested Krishna to be his charioteer, and Krishna, being an intimate friend of Arjuna, agreed wholeheartedly, and hence received the name Parthasarthy, or 'charioteer of the son of Pritha'. Arjuna killed numerous soldiers of the Kaurava army including the greatest warriors on the Kaurava side, Bhishma and Karna. 2. Karna Karna was the first son of Kunti. But out of friendship he decided to fight alongside Duryodana in the battle. He promised Bhishma not to enter the battlefield till he was there fighting because the presence of both of them will be the end of the Pandava army. He entered Kurukshetra after Bhishma fell onto the bed of arrows. [LINKED_TEXT: Karna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karna] defeated the Pandava brothers Nakul, Bhima, [LINKED_TEXT: Sahadeva] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahadeva] and [LINKED_TEXT: Yudhisthira] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhisthira] in battle but spared their lives as he swore not to kill his brothers except Arjuna. Later, Karna resumed duelling with [LINKED_TEXT: Arjuna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna]. During their duel, Karna's chariot wheel got stuck in the mud and Karna asked for a pause. Krishna reminded Arjuna about Karna's ruthlessness unto [LINKED_TEXT: Abhimanyu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu] while he was similarly left without chariot and weapons. Hearing his son's fate, Arjuna shot his arrow and decapitated Karna. Before the day's battle, Karna's sacred armour ('Kavacha') and earrings ('Kundala') were taken as alms by Lord Indra when asked for, which resulted in his death by Arjuna's arrows. 1. Krishna Lord Krishna is considered as the eighth incarnation of Vishnu. Even though he promised not to fight in the battle, yet he is the greatest and he most powerful warrior in the whole tale of Mahabharata. If he had entered the war, then it would have ended in the blink of an eye. He acted as Arjuna's charioteer and strategist. On the ninth day Krishna, overwhelmed by anger at the apparent inability of Arjuna to defeat Bhishma, rushed towards the Kaurava commander, with the wheel of a fallen chariot in his hands. Bhishma lays down his arms and is ready to die at the hands of the Lord, but Arjuna stops Him, reminding of His promise not to wield a weapon.

Then, I woke up and searched this question to answer here. I had 5 crushes since childhood till now, I like to share those incidents with their real names. I don't want to fake it. Crush 1: Her name is Vinitha. Once , We were in Class 6 sitting in front bench , while my physics teacher is distributing exam papers ( She segregated boys and girls papers. She started distributing boys papers from last roll numbers and girls papers from first roll numbers). Luckily , my name is in second roll number and her name is in last second roll number. Meanwhile, I told her that I seen a love song where lovers see eachother 's eyes so long. Can we try this here?😀. She told “yes”. We started to look eachother eyes long time while others were surrounded our teacher. Her friend came suddenly waved her hand in between us and asked “ What's happening here”. My crush told “ Nonsense, get out of here”. We didn't got distracted till our teacher call our names to get exam papers. This is very funny incident. Years passed on, She is still in contact, but she would have forgotten this. She is nice person. Crush 2: Her name is Anila. We were in Class 8. She is topper of our class. She looks beautiful. Few boys started giving line to her but I’m the only one who thinks her as crush. One day, we were splited into groups for class presentation. I'm in her group and she is leading. I have to do chart works at home which my sister helped me out. Next day, I showed the chart work to her. She dragged me to her pulling my hand since, my voice was not audible to her. I told all my friends that she did this. I felt the touch for whole day.😀😀.😀 She is not in contact for past 6 years. Recently, I checked her Fb profile, she got married 😊. She is friendly and lovable person. Crush 3: Her name is Gowthami. We were in same department in engineering college. For our technical symposium, our seniors called us for preparing list. Myself , start doing system work which my seniors got impressed because in short time , I prepared list from large collection of data. She was near me, sitting in front of system doing same work. She stared at me for few seconds.😉 I noticed , but I ignored that because I thought that I got impressed from seniors but she didn't😀. She is my one time crush. She is not in contact for past 4 years. She is emotional and friendly person.She got married recently in this pandemic. Crush 4: Her name is Puja . We are collegues from same year of birth. We are nearby seats. I stopped talking to people too much and find hard mingling with people easily for past 11 years , I became introvert. She is talkative, so I became her good listener. Days goes on, Our collegues gossips that we are lovers. One day , one collegue asked straight to our face. We laughed for the gossips , but we felt it is a crush but never say to each other. She is emotional and friendly person 😀. Crush 5: Her name is Priyanka. We were of same age. We met eachother in random online site. We spoke a lot about our profession, our friends, the climate, our parents, our siblings and our astrology beliefs. We started knowing each other. I started inspiring her.

My motive is to see her face. Lastly, I seen her face. I told her that “ you look old than me, curiosity made me to see your face, but I can't be your perfect match”😔. She replied that “ i have the same feeling after seeing the pic but you had stick to your family's astrology beliefs that is the bitter truth”.🤐 .

It’s like they are squeezing every child into a mold regardless of the child’s learning speed. Once you comprehend this issue, you realize the IQ score is meaningless as well because it is a quotient of age. When people graduate college and start their work life, age means nothing, so why is it so crucial in K-12 and why is IQ so crucial? When a child starts to fall behind, it becomes more and more difficult for them to catch up, with this effect compounding all the way to their last day of school. Children that learn slower than others (for whatever reason, sometimes chaos at home is enough of a distraction) must be given sufficient time for them to master a topic before they move on to the next topic. This approach is called the “Mastery” approach, championed by free online education resources such as Kahn Academy. Without this approach, children who have a harder time learning have a very low likelihood of going to college and succeeding in life, and a very high likelihood of dropping out of society and turning to crime and drugs. We need a sea change in the US, with modern technology we can easily switch to mastery based learning, each child going at their own best pace. You may think many children will take longer to graduate, but because they are safeguarded against the compounding effect of them falling behind, the delay in graduation for many will be less than it is now, and the educational achievement will be much higher.

They are models of, and so aim to describe, a zero-dimensional point in space. The initial success of string theory was in modelling that zero-dimensional point as a 1-dimensional string - working with zero was notoriously problematic and including a degree of freedom with this single dimension gave new ‘life’ to a stalled progression. A mathematical model ensued, borne out of theory and empirical data from particle accelerators that suggested more dimensions were required to fully model the point. The critical dimension at which the mathematical model balanced was 26. And this is the number of dimensions that are thought to constitute the zero-dimensional point. Further development of the mathematics revealed a symmetry that resulted in the need for only 10 dimensions in the model. Six different string theory models emerged. The first, and essentially the 'raw data' used to establish the symmetry of the other 5 models, is the 'bosonic' string theory. It was rejected as a consistent theory on two grounds. Firstly, the theory only defines the boson and not the fermion and secondly, the theory requires and thus predicts a particle with 'imaginary' mass called a tachyon. The real instability arose when the mathematics suggested the tachyon moved faster than the speed of light. Five other string theories that identified symmetry in the mathematics, emerged. We can broadly classify these supersymmetry string theories into 2 types - types I and II - distinguished here by the use of a theoretical construct called a D-brane in the type II theories. D-branes are 2-dimensional planes upon which open strings can attach to become closed strings. More importantly, for quantum matter systems in the standard model, these plane functions map out, what is termed, a 'worldsheet' - which can loosely be interpreted as the boundary surface for the zero-dimensional point. There is a sense here, from the use of D-branes, that focus in the type II string theories is shifting from the geometric framework (which can only reveal symmetry) to a concept that considers the overlying construction to that framework. The names of the 5 string theories that use symmetry considerations are; type I, type IIA, type IIB and 2 heterotic theories, namely SO(32) and E8xE8. While each theory uses a different geometric analytical framework, each is trying to represent the same event using that framework in Euclidean space. And given that the empirical data and foundational mathematics are the same and that all the geometries 'revolve' around a central point, i.e. the origin (0,0,0....depending on the number of axes - or dimensions - passing through it), we might conclude that the models for each of the 5 consistent string theories can be aligned through their origins and geometrically transformed to one another. The standard perception of these 5 string theories is that they are all limiting cases of a unifying theory - called M-theory. Axiomatically, from the table above, the 5 string theories can be considered as identical under transformation. Those transformations come in the form of 3 mathematical tools called s-duality, t-duality and orientifolding. S-duality and t-duality are transformations to the functions representing the relationship between the quantum numbers assigned to the theories - according to their individual conceptual frameworks, i.e. the dilaton, the graviton, the radion, winding number, etc. Orientifolding, on the other hand, is a transformation that operates on the dimension-interpreting geometric framework that defines the 26 dimensions of bosonic theory and the 10 dimensions in the fermionic theories. It was recognised early in the development of the string theories that the type I theory - which uses unoriented open and closed strings - could be equated to the type IIB theory through a process called 'orientifolding'. Orientifolding can be interpreted as a 180 degree rotation of the model’s geometric framework about the central plane (perpendicular to the polar line) - effectively switching polar positions through inversion. If the model works unaffected by the transformation then the strings being modelled will be unoriented but if the inversion changes the model then the orientation of strings is important. Orientifolding the type IIB geometry changes its state from oriented to unoriented - as in the type I theory. Anomalies still existed in the type IIB after it was transformed, but these anomalies cancelled when the D-brane construct from type IIB was applied to type I. In the (reverse) transformation therefore, type I is changed from an unoriented to an oriented model through a geometric transformation that takes account of polarity - the very reason oriented strings are required - and is further changed by use of the same theoretical construct as used by the type IIB - the D-brane - closing off all open string solutions in the type I - thus equating it to type IIB. Both the type I and type IIB theories are themselves equivalent to the heterotic SO(32) and type IIB theories (i.e. type IIB is equivalent to itself), respectively, under another transformation called s-duality. S-duality is a well-established mathematical constraining tool for functions that quickly tend to infinity. The transformation is made around the line y=1. Functions that quickly move from 1 to infinity are rotated about the y=1 line, confining the function's movement to an analytical space between 1 and zero. The function, instead of spinning off into infinity, now starts at 1 and then slowly tends toward zero as x increases. The transformation changes the function f(x)=y to f(x)=1/y, but because the x-component is unaffected, a given value for y in both functions returns the same value of x in each - or conversely a given value for x returns 2 y-solutions, one in each function, that are the inverse of each other. Furthermore, for certain functions that intersect the y-axis (or start) at y=1, such as a function of the exponent e, this transformation is equivalent to another simple transformation of a rotation around the y-axis (x=0). For example, if the function of y is the exponent e raised to the power x for all x, then its path in the +x/+y quadrant of the analytical framework starts at 1 and quickly moves out to infinity. Under an s-duality transformation, the function is rotated and constrained between y=1 and y=0 in the same quadrant. The new function then becomes a reflection of that part of the original function that extends from x=0 through all negative x, i.e. the original function's movement through the -x/+y quadrant as it tends to zero. Therefore an s-duality transformation is equivalent to a simple rotation about the y-axis for a 'well-behaved' function such as y=e^x - but only for positive values of x and y. There is one more transformation - t-duality - that equates the SO(32) heterotic and type IIB theories to the heterotic E8xE8 and type IIA theories, respectively. T-duality can be interpreted as a transformation that equates the value of x with the value of y. Let’s consider the 2 forces in play for a number of string theories - the external expansive force of the local vacuum, represented by the dilaton and the internal contractive force of the string, represented by the graviton. In physical terms, we imagine that these 2 forces act so as to create oscillation in string matter systems. In the expansive phase, the dilaton is greater than the graviton and thus the strings expand. The force in the expanding string - the graviton - increases as the oscillation pulls the matter system out. Ultimately the force represented by the graviton exceeds that of the dilaton and the matter system starts to contract under that greater force. Here we see the values of the graviton and dilaton varying inversely with respect to each other. At the point of expansion the dilaton has a large value and the graviton a small one. At the point of contraction the values are reversed. However, this suggests that there is a point - somewhere in the middle - where the dilaton and the graviton are equal. Geometrically, the t-duality transformation is made around the line y=x. This means that when the 2 forces are equal, the curve representing them becomes asymptotic to the line y=x such that the single solution equality remains under the transformation. With these 3 transformations, the 5 fermionic string theories can be equated to each other, i.e. are seen to be equivalent. This is intuitive given that the geometries used revolve around a central point - the symmetry creating point of rotation - and the empirical data and the theoretical foundation are the same, and that each theory describes exactly the same entity - albeit under a different conceptual framework. Examining the table in fig.7, we see a further symmetry in the model types. As discussed, the type I and type IIB are seen as equivalent under the process of orientifolding. Applying an s-duality transformation to both equates these theories to the SO(32) heterotic and type IIB, respectively, and a t-duality transformation further equates these to the E8xE8 heterotic and type IIA theories, respectively. A clear axiomatic pathway can be seen to link all these theories. The table even suggests direct transforms exist between the 3 adjacent pairs of the type I and type II theories, e.g. the E8xE8 heterotic can be directly transformed to the type IIA theory without having to apply the 5 transforms that pass through all the other theories - though equalities such as this would require additional conceptual alignment. There exists one other duality that we have not yet mentioned - u-duality. This duality relates the s-duality to the t-duality. We can interpret this duality as one that recognises that quantum numbers under different theories with different concepts are in fact the same. For example, the dilaton is considered ‘parallel’ to the radion. So, even though extended theoretical development of the tachyon showed it to 'condense' - indicating its matter potential, and further, providing a basis for the Higgs mechanism which is needed in the standard model to describe the formation of matter from pure energy in the early universe - the bosonic theory was considered deeply flawed by its presence and the lack of an identifiable fermion. The two types of string theory that emerged after the bosonic theory included different concepts for the fermion. The type I included the fermion as a closed string with the boson represented by an open string, whereas the type II theories introduced a 'mass-less' fermion - a concept inconsistent with standard theory yet perfectly describing the tachyon. The heterotic string theories are hybridised bosonic/fermionic theories that use only closed strings. When a string's vibration moved in one direction it was considered to have a bosonic field, when it moved in the opposite direction it was considered to have a fermionic field. Left and right states exist in all the superstring theories - it is the basis of their symmetry - and many physicists remain convinced that these symmetry considerations will unveil the true nature of space, to the extent that a further theory - M-theory - was developed. M-theory is at the forefront of string theory development and is proposed as an all-encompassing theory that includes the 5 string theories as limiting cases. It is closely related to the E8xE8 heterotic and the type IIA theories. The theory is as yet incomplete and not fully understood, or developed, but physicists are of the belief that this next step in string theory development will be the last. This belief is predicated on symmetry considerations that predict a whole host of new 'supersymmetric' partners of every known particle. In effect, the supersymmetry theories maintain that for every known fermion there is a boson 'superpartner' and likewise for every boson there is a fermion superpartner. This is clearly an extension of the concept that the same particle can be fermionic in one direction and bosonic in the other. None of these superpartner particles have ever been found in particle experiments. http://therdanalogy.atwebpages.com/String/String01.html"},{"instruction":"What is a dofollow backlink?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Comment Backlinks – Does It Work For SEO] [URL: https://updatetheory.com/comment-backlinks/] [LINKED_TEXT: Why would we do that and what are the benefits?] [URL: https://updatetheory.com/comment-backlinks/] Comment backlinks we can do for a lot of work and inside it can be that where we keep the backlinks in the comments, many visitors come who read the comments and top the back linked comments then they will enter the backlinked website.

Here are some suggestions: 1. Implement the Two-Minute Rule: If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately instead of postponing it. This helps prevent small tasks from piling up and becoming a burden. 2. Practice the Pomodoro Technique: Break your work into 25-minute intervals (pomodoros) with short breaks in between. After completing four pomodoros, take a longer break. This method helps maintain focus and prevents burnout. 3. Use the Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritize tasks using this matrix, which classifies them into four categories: Urgent and Important, Important but Not Urgent, Urgent but Not Important, and Not Urgent or Important. Focus on tasks that fall into the first category. 4. Leverage the Power of Habit Stacking: Attach a new habit you want to form to an existing habit. For example, if you want to read more, make it a habit to read a few pages after brushing your teeth every night. 5. Try Time Blocking: Schedule specific blocks of time for different activities or tasks throughout your day. This helps create a structured routine and minimizes distractions. 6. Optimize Your Environment: Create a workspace that is clean, organized, and free from distractions. Minimize clutter and personalize your space to make it conducive to productivity. 7. Practice Mindfulness and Meditation: Take short breaks during the day to engage in mindfulness exercises or meditation. This can help clear your mind, reduce stress, and improve focus. 8. Use Productivity Apps and Tools: Explore various productivity apps and tools available for task management, note-taking, time tracking, and project collaboration. Find the ones that work best for your workflow and incorporate them into your routine. 9. Focus on Single-Tasking: Multitasking can often lead to decreased productivity and increased errors. Instead, concentrate on one task at a time, giving it your full attention before moving on to the next. 10. Incorporate Regular Exercise and Breaks: Physical activity and regular breaks throughout the day can boost your energy levels and overall productivity. Take short walks, stretch, or engage in quick exercises to refresh your mind and body. Remember that different techniques work for different people, so it's essential to experiment and find the strategies that resonate with you.

Absolutely nothing is preventing us from becoming the science fiction world that many movies (and books!) predicted. However. There are many things preventing us from realizing that we are currently living inside a science fiction world: Historical perspective and the advancement of science When most people think about scientific evolution, they usually picture a neat technological tree a la Civilization videogame like this: Certainly, we humans needed to invent the wheel before landing rockets in the Moon. From our historical vantage point of view, it all seems logical, neat and tidy. The problem is, that people in the past, and scientists in our present doesn’t have a neat technological tree to guide them towards future discoveries and their prequisites. Science progression is messy and prone to trial and error. We go blind into the future. We often stumble into several unexpected roadblocks that we could not foresee before, like Einstein’s relativity and his pesky speed limits that prevent us from reaching faster than light travel. That makes some technologies advance way slower than we thought (space travel comes to mind), while some of them advance way faster than we could ever imagine (like computers). Consequently, science advancement tends to go way slower than what many techno-optimists would like. That mismatch between expectations and results are a bit of a party pooper, but there are more factors in play here. Lack of historical perspective and the triumph of the anti-progress narrative Our current social undercurrent is dominated by post modernism, and one of its cornerstones is the rejection of the values of enlightment, chiefly, the notion of human progress. Consequently, every single scientific advancement needs to be minimized and ignored (or better: demonized), or else our precious post modern narrative of “everything is relative, there is nothing better nor worse”, could be jeopardized. Hence the rise of anti-scientific movements like the anti-vaxxers or the flat earthers. We really need to believe that mankind have not progressed, and that our magnificent scientific advancements are for naught, and that everything is worse than ever, that technology and industrial society is leading us to our destruction, hence why a lot of anti progress prophets of doom selectively embrace the science behind climate change. The problem is that this narrative is patently false, and based in the nihilistic, minds of the people that expouses it, than in any trace of external reality. Because we are not living on a sci fi world. We have in many regards, surpassed what science fiction promised. Does this looks futuristic enough to you?

However, the prophets of doom have a great ally thanks to: Lack of social advancement The advancement of technology doesn’t mean that its gains are evenly distributed among society. You can have a highly technological society with crappy ethics and opressive social structures. Which is the problem here. Science might cure cancer someday, but it sure won’t cure assholes nor corrupt leaders. Scientific advances can be misused. And progress not only applies to science, but to societies as well. And let be honest with ourselves: Our societies are not more fair nor enlightened than decades ago, and the western democracies haven’t had an exactly stellar record at improving our countries in the latest century. And yet, I would take our world of imperfect democracies and cronist politicians over the murderous madness of war-torn early XXth century, thank you very much. So here we are. We are living in the future. It’s not as perfect as our utopians imagined. We are no Culture, no Star Trek federation, no Asimov foundation.

Ultron is already violating rules established in other, more canonical MCU shows. The Infinity Gems Ultron is using should not function outside of their own native Universe. This was well established in the Loki series. They certainly should not function in a space such as that of The Watcher, who is outside of the Multiverse. Next, we might point out that it was only through knowledge of the secrets of the Eye of Agamotto that Dr. Strange was able to survive Dormomu's attacks and ultimately defeat him. Ultron is not so well versed and depended on Thanos just handing him all of the stones. Speaking of the stones, the What If? story is also ignoring that the stones are treacherous in their own right. The space stone sent the Red Skull to Vormir and the assembled stones injured anyone who used the gauntlet to “make a wish\\". So, really, the stones aught to have been taking some kind of toll on Ultron. Granted, this is all for a specifically non-canon cartoon, so it's fine that the What If ? Series plays around.

Borrowing liberally from War of the Worlds, Aliens, and every sci-fi invasion film inbetween, director Roland Emmerich and producer and co-writer Dean Devlin present a visually slick, fast-paced adventure filled with expensive special effects and large-scale action sequences. The story begins with the approach of a series of massive spaceships, which many on Earth greet with open arms, looking forward to the first contact with alien life. Unfortunately, these extraterrestrials have not come in peace, and they unleash powerful weapons that destroy most of the world's major cities. Thrown into chaos, the survivors struggle to band together and put up a last-ditch resistance in order to save the human race. As this is a Hollywood film, this effort is led by a group of scrappy Americans, including a computer genius who had foreseen the alien's evil intent (Jeff Goldblum), a hot-shot jet pilot (Will Smith), and the President of the United States (Bill Pullman). While some critics objected to the film's lack of originality and lapses in logic, the combination of grand visual spectacle and crowd-pleasing storytelling proved irresistible to audiences, resulting in an international smash hit.

Generally, we were the only two people on site. Anyway, my coworker was a NeoNazi and would tell me things like, “If I got my way, I would take all Jews like you and melt you into globules of oil.” Then things got really out of control when he started physically threatening me.

Instead they left him there and moved me to a different (lower paying) job site. I quit shortly thereafter.

Will they be viewed as weak? Stupid? Foolish?That no one will love them again because they are “too damaged,” or “not good enough.” That they’re “not strong enough.” Deciding to leave an abuser is most definitely an empowered choice. However, choosing to leave an abuser is not about whether or not someone is strong enough. There are plenty of \\"strong people” who still end up suffering from abuse. Hope (Love) That the abuse will go away.That the person will/can change.That they can rescue their abuser. People try to convince themselves (and sometimes others) that their abuser will change. Many times, the victim believes that this change is dependent on how well they love their abuser. They start thinking things like, “If I can just love him/her enough/more, I know they’ll be different.” They may minimize the abuse, telling themselves that, “It’s not that bad,” or “It only happens a few times a year.” What is more, the victim may point to some progress their abuser has made, or to their abuser’s positive qualities. For instance, perhaps their abuser is a good provider or successful or dependable. Because of this, they may ignore the budding “red flags” (especially in the beginning) and hope that things will be different with enough time and with enough love. In a real sense, they put themselves in a “rescuer” role, believing that they can “fix” their abuser. While this comes from a good place—a place of steadfast love and a true desire to help—it is extremely imbalanced and misguided. If you were to compare this to an addiction to drugs or alcohol, for example, a person who is struggling with addiction will not just magically stop given the right prescription of love. Instead, that person has to want to change, and no amount of hope or love will suffice—true change is not forced."},{"instruction":"Who is headless CMS for?","output":"CMS in its usual sense combines the content and appearance of the website. Most monolithic systems are \\"linked\\". That is, CMA and CDA are being combined. In the past few years, we have seen an increase in the number of systems that try to be more flexible in their way of delivering content. The decoupled CMS does not contain it, does not deal with views, templates, structure, or design of the site. It does not associate content with a specific output (such as rendering a web page) but provides it as data via an API. The concept allows you to attract customers through multiple channels with personalized content. Headless architecture is reactive, so it stays idle until a request is sent to the content. The structure is really flexible, content is treated as data, and designers work in specially adapted environments in real-time.

If you have a great memory, you can get the top rank in the class. Most of our studies were done just before the exams and we forgot almost everything once the exams were over. Since I never liked Engineering, I also never scored well during exams. I was just an average student in my class having rank of around 25-30 in the class of 52. After my B Tech, I joined Larsen and Toubro (L&T), which was ‘the’ engineering company during our time and it used to be the dream job of half of the IIT Bombay students then. I worked there for almost one year. I, however, realized that the job of an engineer in a company like L&T was very monotonous. You were doing exactly the same thing over and over again for months and years. I decided to quit the job as I found that it did not suit me. When I left L&T and joined M Tech in IIT Delhi, I had made up my mind that I would either be a Civil Servant or a Professor by doing M Tech + PhD. Since I was no good at Engineering (Mechanical Engineering), I decided to drop this as an option and choose Maths + Physics (Two optional required during those days). Fortunately, I got into IRS in the first attempt itself. I worked as a civil servant (IRS officer) for 25 years and loved my job. However, I am now pursuing my second passion i.e. to become a writer and educator after taking VRS from Government.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","output":"How? With the help of Al-Anon, or any other spiritual program, I learned to detach from disruptive situations involving a narcissist by using the slogan “you didn’t cause it, you can’t control it, and you can’t cure it”, so over many years, I learned to live the “walk the talk” principle until it became hard-wired. This can take a very long time to achieve, and instant results are not possible nor sustainable. In this way, the trauma bond is disengaged because you focus on yourself and not the narcissist nor on the relationship, and you now have agency separate from what the narcissist does or doesn’t do. You walked away from the “game” and you’re not playing any more. You will eventually notice that your disengagement feels better than the relationship itself, and you will make better choices in your life. In “everyday life”, you move on by avoiding people and situations whose dysfunction will only cause you pain. Your radar has been re-tuned to pick up the potential for bad outcomes in people you used to think were “exciting”. You accept your dismissal of the relationship no matter how many other narcissistic relationships you can observe and think they are “successful”. You are able to feel with your heart, and not just think with your brain, that such a relationship will not work for you or anyone else, and you can see the distress and confusion on the horizon, so you are not interested. If you want to summon your “inner child”, you know that you would never subject any child to this abuse, so why is it OK for you? The trauma bond is released when you decide that the pain of narcissistic abuse is greater than the anxiety and uncertainty of being alone or building another relationship."},{"instruction":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","output":"Upset?

Grab some shoes, and you’re ready to go! But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. In fact, there are four mistakes I see new runners making over and over. Going too hard, too soon. If you haven’t been running on a regular basis, start by using run–walk intervals to safely take you from walking the distance to running the distance. Pro Tip: Not sure how to safely progress? Enter your email and I’ll send over my free walk to 5k plan After, you’ve built up for a few months, be sure to run frequently to make it a habit, then a lifestyle. How frequently? Well it really depends on your goals. If your goal is to run three miles at the same pace for general fitness purposes, your run frequency target will look much different than someone training to PR their marathon. Even if you don’t care about times or performance, you should plan to run at least three times a week. Look at it this way. If you only run one to two times a week, you may never improve much, enjoy running, or experience many of the other benefits “they” talk about (like a runner’s high). I am reminded of this every time I am forced to take a break. [Like my recent super-long break during [LINKED_TEXT: twin pregnancy] [URL: https://bethanyrutledge.com/baby/whats-like-pregnant-twins/].] I recalled why people say they can’t stand running.

One common new runner mistake is go for a PR—in distance or speed—each time they lace up their shoes. Eventually this approach will lead to injury, and/or limit your ability to progress and thus improve. I hope that helps!

The entire film is very beautifully crafted. It is not at all a candy floss rom-com by Dharma Production, but a totally realistic self realization story of a rich spoilt kid who had no ambitions or goals in life, who finally finds out his passion, and grows up to be a man. Plus lots more! Although, almost every scene is a favourite of mine, here are some thoughts about the climax of Wake Up Sid! Sid returns home after spending months with Aisha in her apartment, after he decided to leave home after having an argument with him over his failing college! Aisha, an aspiring writer fell in love with Sid, and realized that somewhat earlier. As her article comes up on 'Mumbai Beats' magazine, and Sid starts reading it, he soon realized what Aisha means, and then the 'rain' scene happens. The next scene that depicts both at their own locations enjoying the rain is epic, it is an amalgamation of realization stimulated by rain and along with the beautiful song 'Boondon ke moti' is just awesome. Sid knew exactly where to find Aisha, and there he confesses his love for her, with Mumbai skyline in the background, and the monsoon! The climax, although cannot boast of a twist, it is perfect for a film of that genre. And, only when one watches the film he will know the true significance of the scene. The first time I watched the film, I watched this last scene over and over about 25 times or so. Of course the film teaches us a lot more:It clearly depicts a part of the life of the rich kid, Siddharth Malhotra, someone who had no ambition or goal in life, the importance of friends in his life, the parental pressure and how eventually he fails in the finals of his college and how his life changes after that!Overall a great watch, hats off to Ayan Mukherji."},{"instruction":"Republicans say democrats are trying to turn kids gay, but aren’t they trying to turn gay kids straight with conversion camps?","output":"Since homosexuality is a choice, conversion camp only gives them their choices.

Which one should be read first or last? Why?","output":"Which gospel that should be read first depends on what you want to know about Jesus and His time here on earth. Matthew was written by a Jew for the Jews portraying Jesus as the rightful heir to the throne of Judah. He is the face of the Lion, the king of the beasts, as pictured in the vision of the four faced beast in Ezekiel and Revelation’s throne of God vision. In order to prove He is the rightful heir (king), His genealogy is traced back to Abraham only in this gospel. It is also the only gospel to mention the kingdom of heaven, or Jesus’ coming millennium rule as king, whereas Mark and Luke only mention the kingdom of God that comes after the millennium. Here too is the only place that mentions the 3 magi visiting the baby Jesus to honor this future king and Harod attempting to kill this future king with his ‘slaughter of the innocents’ attempt. Mark was written by a Roman to the Romans portraying Jesus as the perfect servant. There is more action in Mark than the other gospels because the Romans preferred action over words. As the face of the Ox or cherubim in the four faced beast, Jesus reminds us there is more glory in serving than being served or honored. His sacrifice on behalf of mankind on the cross was the ultimate proof of Him being the perfect servant. Luke was written by a Greek to the Greeks, represented Jesus as the perfect man, because the Greeks idealized the perfect man. His genealogy goes back to Adam to prove He was of the race of Adam. Only by being of the race of Adam could He redeem that race by way of His sacrificial blood and prove He was that perfect man. Also only in this gospel, is the story of Mary and Joseph where her virgin birth of the ‘man’ Jesus is emphasized. John was written by a Christian to the Christians portraying Jesus as the Word, or God. With the face of the eagle in the four faced beast, as the highest flying creature He is above His creation. In John we see that most of Jesus’ discussions are with the religious leaders, and it is only in John that Jesus calls Himself the I AM."},{"instruction":"Who is your favourite character from all of the Middle Earth lore and why?","output":"Easy peesy.

Gandalf died and came back as “Saruman SHOULD have been” so he was basically Saruman+Gandalf, which is going to always be the stronger than just Saruman or Just Gandalf. Now. Things not going your way? Why not make an alliance with the ultimate Dark Lord? Always a good fallback if Sauron would have won, Saruman would have been sipping wine and smoking pipeweed from the balcony of orthanc and wave to the Nazgul as they fly by. No biggie. Now. You feeling kinda bored? I don’t think people realize JUST HOW CRAZY Saruman the white was. In the best way possible. The guy turned his little flower-tower into the little-brother equivalent of Barad-dur! He massed together an army which won Helms Deep, (if not for Gandalf and a thousand other Rohirrim riding in from behind) He made the biggest leaps in technology in probably all of Middle-earth, creating the ‘flame of orthanc’ which would make C4 drool. And then he attacked the second strongest faction of men in the world! With an army he made from 0 to 100 in a MONTH! A MONTH! So here we have a guy who pushed, beat, pulled, and broke every single law everyone else was following. This guy didn’t have a limit. AAANNNNDD. He was NOT evil, no matter how much he was portrayed in the movie… Saruman made an alliance with Sauron because he KNEW Sauron would win. There was a .5% to 99.5% that Sauron would win. And, Saruman did whatever any normal person would do. He said ‘alrighty, lets make an alliance! I’m betting on you to win, and when you do, we be besties, alrighty?” But Saruman was going to ‘betray’ Sauron! He was going to be his ally, yes. He would perhaps work for him, but look at this. Saruman made an alliance so that he could keep the seed of rebellion. He would have kept an alliance with some survivors, in secret he would have forged a rebellion, he would rise up with his armies of Orthanc and crushed the armmies of Mordor off-guard! And, while this would be getting built up, Sauron would very likely give him the lands of Rohan and the Wold, (which would be like, at LEAST 10x the land Saruman possesed) AND Saruman would have probably talked the hill-men of Dunland to pledge themselves to Sauron, and he personally would let them keep their land, and, owning Rohan, would probably give it to him. Thus, getting the favor of Dunland, THUS, Getting most of Dunland on HIS side if, oh, I don’t know, a WAR would break out sometime? Hmm? Just an idea… So, in my eyes, Saruman was a total beast. Nobody else in my eyes sits close to him. He’s on top of the pyramid, second to none. Honorable mentions: Boromir, Bilbo Baggins, Thorin + Co. and Smaug. otherwise, hope this helped!

Are you going to be using the software from a mobile device? Do you need the lowest cost option, or are you willing to pay more for a specific premium feature? Is it important to have software that can handle specific needs for your business? Or will a general accounting package work just fine? However specific your needs, there are a number of choices of accounting software packages. Asking the right questions about your needs can help eliminate programs from consideration that won’t do you any good. For example, if you need a mobile-ready, Mac compatible program for your [LINKED_TEXT: electrical contracting business] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/electrician] of five employees, you can save yourself time from sorting through all those programs that are Windows-only, meant for larger businesses, and don’t include mobile apps.

Available in both a [LINKED_TEXT: desktop and an online version] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/academy/quickbooks-online-vs-desktop-comparison/], either of which can support your business, depending on your requirements. One of the most powerful aspects of QuickBooks comes from its ability to integrate with additional products (like [LINKED_TEXT: FieldPulse] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/]). These integrations extend the core accounting functionality by allowing them to offer new features, like [LINKED_TEXT: timesheets, job costing, team scheduling] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/contractor] and more.

There are three different levels of pricing from 9 a month (Starter) to 30 (Standard for up to 5 users) to 70 at the Premium level, which includes unlimited invoicing and multiple currencies. The Premium tier allows you to add more users at 2 per person per month (which can really add up for larger companies). But, for smaller companies who work internationally, they offer accounting options and flexibility that is hard to find with other accounting packages. Xero also has a variety of partners to provide direct banks feeds and integrated financial services. In addition to the competitive pricing, they offer a free trial for the first month. The Jonas Corporation One popular program for construction-specific companies is the [LINKED_TEXT: Jonas Premier Cloud Construction Software] [URL: http://jonaspremier.com/].

Sage has some nice features, including automatic sales tax calculations and project-based reporting. But it lacks some standard options, like purchase orders. They are in the early stages of offering cloud-based services, but as with other companies, expect their cloud services to grow. Their pricing includes a basic version for 10 per month and their full accounting program for 25 per month. ZipBooks If you’re looking for a free option to get started, [LINKED_TEXT: ZipBooks] [URL: https://zipbooks.com/] is a great starting point. The free tier won’t match what’s offered with their paid program, or the other options on this list. However, it does allow you to keep track of the basics.

This makes ZipBooks another option for growing with your business.

It's important to note that spot reduction of fat in specific areas, including the face, is not possible. However, by following these general guidelines, you may be able to achieve a slimmer face over time: Maintain a Caloric Deficit: To lose weight overall, including in the face, you need to create a caloric deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. Focus on a balanced diet that is rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit your intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages.Regular Cardiovascular Exercise: Engaging in regular cardiovascular exercises, such as brisk walking, running, cycling, or swimming, can help burn calories and contribute to overall weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine to build muscle mass. Increased muscle mass can help boost your metabolism and contribute to a more toned appearance. Consider exercises that target the muscles in your face and neck, such as facial yoga or resistance exercises.Facial Exercises: Facial exercises may help tone the muscles in your face and reduce puffiness. Some examples include chin lifts, cheek puff exercises, and jawline exercises. While the effectiveness of facial exercises in reducing face fat is not scientifically proven, they may help improve muscle tone and definition.Stay Hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water can help keep your body hydrated, maintain overall health, and reduce bloating. Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water per day.Limit Sodium Intake: Excessive sodium consumption can contribute to water retention and bloating. Be mindful of your sodium intake by avoiding high-sodium processed foods and reducing the amount of salt you add to your meals.Get Sufficient Sleep: Inadequate sleep can contribute to fluid retention and puffiness in the face. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night to support overall health and reduce facial bloating.Manage Stress: High stress levels can lead to weight gain and fluid retention. Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in activities you enjoy to help reduce stress.Be Patient: It's important to note that changes in facial fat may take time and vary from person to person. Focus on overall health, weight loss, and adopting a healthy lifestyle rather than solely targeting face fat reduction. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, particularly if you have any underlying health conditions.

Walking in a parking lot? “I’m going to hold your hand to keep you safe.” Getting them strapped into the carseat? “I’m buckling you in to keep you safe.” Moving something dangerous out of reach? “I’m putting this away to keep you safe.” So it’s a positive statement about what I’m doing (not what my child should or shouldn’t be doing), and also a way to connect and show it’s out of love for them. It can be used in other forms as well: With food: “I’m serving you this healthy snack (instead of whatever junk food they are whining for) because I want you to get big and strong.” With bedtime: “I’m turning out the lights because I want you to get a good night’s rest, so you have energy to play with your friends at school tomorrow.” Seriously, try this if you have little ones!

She carefully listened to our requirements and provided us with ideas that were within our budget. Each member of our family had unique needs, which were all satisfied. Timeline for the project Now for the actual on-the-ground experience. I was hesitant to entrust our home to a company like Livspace home interiors because no one in my immediate network had utilised them before. Our designer, on the other hand, gradually put us at ease. They offered us a schedule for the entire process after team Livspace completed the drawings. Given that I work full-time, I was understandably concerned about how I would manage this assignment. However, Livspace quickly resolved this because of a comprehensive plan they gave before the project commencement. I am utterly amazed at the kind of services Livspace home interiors have provided us.

Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and so many others. What else do you like? Whatever you are interested in on the continent, there are many countries who are safe for you. Just do your research and go for it. Meet wonderful people, learn about their cultures, and their beautiful lands and countries. As far as safety is concerned, below are some countries I would stay away from. I do not negotiate with my safety. If you are hesitating, you should not go. Africa is big and there are so many choices for you and your friends. Keep in mind, this list might change at some point. As of July 2018, I would not call the following countries safe at all. I would not recommend you to go there. If I can’t go, I won’t recommend anybody to go. Unless, you know for sure where you will be going. Somalia ( Based on Al Shabab).Libya ( Libya is not the same without Mr. Gaddafi).South Soudan ( New country with some political issues).Republic of Central Africa ( Based on UN peaceful mission troops there).Northern Part of Cameroun ( Some politics between French and English speaking Cameroun). The French part is quite safe.Whatever regions where Boko Haram is located ( parts of Nigeria in the North and elsewhere). They are quite unpredictable, so I am not taking the chance. Some people might add a few countries, depending on their circumstances. Selected parts of Mali, Niger, and Tchad.Eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo. There are still rebel groups in some remote areas. Those areas are very unsafe.In December, 2017, Although I visited Bukavu, the largest city in Eastern DRC, I would not recommend it. The presidential elections are around the corner in DRC and things don’t look too good there. President Kabila does not want to go. However, the Congolese people clearly don’t want him no more. The only reason I visited there, was because I lived in DRC for three years and still have family who live there. In a way, I was taken care of there. My fiancee and soon to be wife is Rwandan-Congolese.As a Rwandan, I would add Burundi on this list. The politics there are not good at all. Regardless of how conservative you are, there are going to be over 40–45 out of 55 countries who are very safe. In many cases, if you are traveling for the first time, I would focus on doing your research before going as well as maintaining situational awareness wherever you are going. Medication. I am African, so I am used to mosquitoes and don’t bring anti-malaria pills with me. However, many people learn the hard way that our weather and climate is just different. In my work in Ghana, we used to get a medical kit with Malarone and other first aid stuff. Definitely, do not forget anti-malaria pills. Presidential Elections. If you are going to a country and their past two presidential elections have not been peaceful to your standards, I would be very careful to go there. Be aware and keep that in mind as you prepare your travels. For example, countries such as Kenya, Burkinafaso, Togo, Gabon, and a few more others are very peaceful today. However, I would be very careful to go there in presidential times. Kenya has been like that for while.Burkinafaso was transitioning from a 25 year rule with Blaise Compaore. It is clear the Burkinabe people did not like him. It was ugly when they finally reversed him from power. Today, the new president, Christian Kabore, looks promising.Togo and Gabon have been lead by one man or family for a while now. When I talk to people from those countries, they explain me there is always uncertainity during presidential elections. After elections, things usually take a few months to get back to normal. At the moment, these four countries a “GO” by my standards.

Just like Paris ( France) and Prague ( Czech Republic), pickpocketing is a big issue in big cities in many African countries. If you are a first time traveler, be vigilent for your cell phones and electronics. In fact, since we are talking about safety, this is what you should worry about first. Nobody knows you there to harm you. If anything, the thieves are after your money and electronics. The Do’s and the Dont’s. It is your responsibility to be a good tourist. Learn what to do and not to do. Traveling is expensive and you do not want to ruin your experience over somethings you should have known. In each country, their ways of doing things might be different from yours, so adjust yourself accordingly. For example, I would not visit any of the Muslim countries during Ramadan. Why? Because depending on where you are going, businesses and major attractions might be closed or open for short hours. If you can anticipate situations like these, you are going to save yourself some headaches. Those who have read my answers before know that I am not a big fan of big cities. Unless, I am there for the purpose of working or other business trips. I try to stay away. I do not like to hustle in metropolitican cities when I am on vacation. I personally like to go to the islands in coastal areas, safaris, and other natural beauties that countries have to offer. More hints about navigating through big cities. Big cities are known to be the worst at scamming 1st time tourists. Large cities such as Abuja, Johannesburg, Lagos, and similar others. Wherever you are about to go, do some research on what to expect. Travel smart and be aware. Talking to random strangers ( in some parts of Johannesburg) might not a good idea. Nobody is about to sell you some gold or diamond. Stay away from strangers you don’t know. I would not buy anything on the streets if you are not familiar with the area. Be a good traveler and be aware of your surroundings in the busy cities. I can’t stand traffic jams in big cities. This is why I stay away from the metropolitan cities. I can manage with average-medium size cities better. All in all, it is really worth it. There is no place like Africa. You will find some of the friendliest and hospitable people in Africa. We love to share our cultures, dances, songs, and many other unique traditions. This is me at the King’s palace in Rwanda. How we used to do it back in ancient times.

In Egypt, I am more familiar with Alexandria, Sharm El Sheikh, and Cairo to some extent. Many Germans go Scuba diving there, so will I be. If it is your first time in North Africa, maybe I should not recommend Tunisia for you. However, the tourism industry is booming again ( after Arab Spring). Their minister of defense deploys defense forces to make sure that the beaches of Tunisia are safe for tourists. So many French people go there for short and long vacations.

I think people must smuggle food home in their bags too."},{"instruction":"Social Science","output":"More than sixty years ago, the British scientist and novelist C. P. Snow delivered the Rede Lecture (University of Cambridge) on “The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution.” The two cultures that he was referring to were scientific culture and literary-humanist culture. His contention was that since the 19th century, there had developed a gulf between the two cultures which had led to a breakdown in communications between them and that this breakdown in communications was at the root of many of the problems besetting modern society. One issue that he did not address in that lecture was the status of the social sciences. The social sciences would seem to stand somewhere intermediate between the natural sciences and the humanities. As it turns out, the kind of division that Snow perceived to exist within modern culture between scientific culture and literary-humanist culture seems to exist within the social sciences themselves. There are many social scientists that tend to identify with what Snow had called scientific culture. And at the same time, there are many other social scientists who tend to identify more with literary-humanist culture. Those social scientists who identify with scientific culture, I would call positivists, while those social scientists who identify more with literary-humanist culture, I would call antipositivists. This split within the social sciences has existed for a long time, certainly since the early 19th century. And positivist/antipositivist debates have been going on in the social science for quite some time. One curious aspect of the positivist/antipositivist debates within the social sciences is that they seem to cut across not just the boundaries that exist between different social sciences but also across all sorts of ideological and theoretical differences that exist within the social sciences. The term, positivism, is one that has been widely bandied about in both the social sciences and the humanities. It is not always clear as to what is being referred to. So, before going further with this discussion it might be useful to keep in mind the typology of positivism that Russell Keat proposed in his 1981 book The Politics of Social Theory. There, he provided the following typology of positivist theses in social theory: 1). The 'scientist' thesis which asserts that science alone represents genuine forms of human knowledge. And by science he was referring to the natural sciences. Thus, legitimate human knowledge would be said to include the natural sciences plus any other disciplines that are modeled more or less on the natural sciences. 2). The positivist conception of science which holds that science aims at the explanation and prediction of observable phenomena by treating them as instances of universal natural laws. That is what Carl Hempel referred to as the covering-law model of scientific explanation is adhered to. The scientific validity of statements describing natural laws is assessed solely in terms of their logical relationships to other statements describing observation data. The positivist conception of science was developed over the years by such thinkers as Berkeley, Hume, Comte, J. S. Mill, Ernst Mach, and in the last century, by the logical positivists including Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl, Hans Reichenbach and Philipp Frank among others. And returning to Comte, it should be noted that he was the creator of both Positivism as a philosophy and of sociology as a distinct discipline, intended to be the positive science of society. 3). The advocacy of a scientific politics, that is the idea that science can provide rational solutions to all problems concerning the organization of society and that such decisions can be freed from nonscientific influences. This view can be traced back to Lord Bacon. In the 19th century, Henri de Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte were very notable exponents of scientific politics, and in the 20th and 21st centuries there have been a host of thinkers who have subscribed to it as well, mostly as defenders of some form of technocracy. 4). The doctrine of value-freedom, which is the doctrine that it is both possible and necessary to separate out the realm of science from the realms of moral and political values. The validity of scientific theories does not depend on the acceptance or rejection of any particular moral or political commitments. Science is therefore 'value-free.' This doctrine can be found the writings of Hume, Kant and Mill but its greatest exponent in the social sciences was probably Max Weber. These four positivist theses are logically independent of each other. There have been many thinkers who subscribed to only a couple of these theses while rejecting the others. Thus, Karl Popper rejected the first thesis - the 'scientist' thesis while subscribing to a modified version of the second one, as well as the value-free thesis, and largely rejecting the ideal of a scientific politics as being incompatible with his ideal of an open society. Many people have subscribed to a positivist conception of science while rejecting the 'scientist' thesis (i.e. the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain). Positivist social science has tended to emphasize quantitative methodologies. In sociology, that has tended to mean an emphasis of such methods as surveys, while in economics this has largely taken the form of an emphasis on mathematical model building and on statistical analysis. And in recent years, sociology has to some extent come to embrace mathematical model building as well. Antipositvists on the other hand are skeptical of modeling social science after the natural sciences. They tend to emphasize the kinship of the social sciences with the humanities. Antipositivism in sociology has led to an emphasis on qualitative or interpretivist methodologies like first-hand observation, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, participant-observation with the data generally being non-numerical. While in economics, antipositivism, such as found in the Austrian School there is a strong suspicion of using mathematical models. Some notable antipositivists would include people like Dilthey, and Weber, plus people like Scheler, Levi-Strauss, and Geertz. Some varieties of antipositivist sociology would include phenomenological sociology, ethnomethodology, and postmodern forms of sociology. We can see these positivist/anti-positivist debates going on in different social science disciplines and within different and even opposing ideological camps. Thus, within economics, Milton Friedman was a notable defender of a positivist approach to economics: “ Economics as a positive science is a body of tentatively accepted generalisations about economic phenomena that can be used to predict the consequences of changes in circumstances.” Whereas, some of the members of the Austrian School, like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek were notable anti-positivists. Yet, Friedman, von Mises, and Hayek, all shared similar political outlooks. At the same time, the British socialist economist Joan Robinson, a famous Left Keynesian, in her 1962 book, Economic Philosophy, used positivism to ground her critique of mainstream economics. For Robinson, neoclassical economics was grounded in assumptions that are not empirically falsifiable. Although in that book she cited Karl Popper’s writings on the philosophy of science as the philosophical foundation for the critique of neoclassical economics that she pursued in that book, she seems to me to undertake a critique of the foundations of neoclassical economics not unlike the one that Ernst Mach undertook of Newtonian physics in his book, The Science of Mechanics. Just as Mach attempted to expose the metaphysical assumptions that had been uncritically accepted in Newtonian physics, Robinson attempted to similarly expose the metaphysical assumptions that were uncritically accepted by neoclassical economists. Like Mach, she thought that exposing these assumptions as being metaphysical was sufficient grounds for rejecting them, since they were not testable, but were reflective of the ruling ideologies in society, and in her opinion, constituted obstacles to the advance of economic science. As she put it: \\"Economics limps along with one foot in untested hypotheses and the other in untestable slogans.\\" In drawing distinctions between science and metaphysics, she drew heavily upon Karl Popper’s falsifiability criterion. Yet, this usage of Popper seems to me to be a good example of the creative misuse of a thinker's ideas. Popper himself was not particularly anti-metaphysical. In fact he took the logical positivists to task precisely on that point. And my impression of Popper is that he had no objections as such against the use of metaphysical assumptions within science. So Robinson's program in regards to economics seems much more in tune with those of the logical positivists than it is with Popper's own programs. (BTW Karl Popper was longtime friend of Friedrich Hayek, although he considered himself to be a socialist or a social democrat for most of his adult life). I think that it is noteworthy that in the 1973 undergraduate textbook on economics that she co-authored with John Eatwell, Introduction to Modern Economics, she reiterated the same arguments that she had presented in Economic Philosophy, but she made no mention at all of Karl Popper. Likewise, among Marxists, such debates have been going on for well over a hundred years. Nikolai Bukharin, for instance, wrote a treatise on historical materialism that was explicitly positivist in its approach. Antonio Gramsci famously wrote a review in his Prison Notebooks that panned that book, in which Gramsci took a strongly anti-positivist stance, as did also Lukacs. Returning to Bukharin, in his book,[LINKED_TEXT: Historical Materialism] [URL: https://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1921/histmat/index.htm], he insisted that social reality, like the natural world, is governed by objective causal laws and that the reign of causality in society, excludes any role for teleology, just as the progress of the natural sciences has led to the replacement of teleological explanations by causal explanations. In Bukharin’s view, a scientific sociology based on the materialist conception of history will likewise lead to the replacement of teleological explanations of social phenomena by causal explanations. In the end, Bukharin probably accepted at least three of the theses that Keat identified as characteristic of positivism. And it should be noted that the full title of his book was , [LINKED_TEXT: Historical Materialism-A System of Sociology.] [URL: https://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1921/histmat/index.htm] . Up to then, most Marxists had been hostile to sociology, which they saw as a bourgeois discipline. Bukharin by writing about a Marxist sociology suggested that kind of rapprochement was possible. And in his case, the possibility of such a rapprochement was grounded in the acceptance of a positivist approach to social science. Antonio Gramsci in his Prison Notebooks, took exception to Bukharin’s approach, concentrating his fire on Bukharin’s positivism, which he regarded as being incompatible with Marxism And Lukacs criticized Bukharin along similar lines too. He wrote: But in his philosophical remarks, Bukharin rejects all the elements in Marxist method which derive from classical German philosophy, without realizing the inconsistency this involves. Of course, Hegel is mentioned from time to time, but the essential comparison of his and Marx’s dialectic is absent. Characteristically, the only reference to Feuerbach is to note that with him ‘matter came to the fore’; ‘his influence on Marx and Engels assisted the development of the true theory of dialectical materialism.’ He completely ignores the problem of the relation between Feuerbach’s humanism and the Marxist dialectic. This point has been particularly stressed because it clearly reveals the essential error in Bukharin’s conception of historical materialism. The closeness of Bukharin’s theory to bourgeois, natural-scientific materialism derives from his use of ‘science’ (in the French sense) as a model. In its concrete application to society and history it therefore frequently obscures the specific feature of Marxism: that all economic or ‘sociological’ phenomena derive from the social relations of men to one another. Emphasis on a false ‘objectivity’ in theory leads to fetishism. Within the Marxist tradition, members of the Frankfurt School were notorious for being staunch critics of positivism, in both its Marxian and bourgeois forms. Criticisms of positivism are rampant in the writings of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse. In the 1960’s, members of the Frankfurt School, including both older members like Adorno, and younger members like Habermas debated these issues with Karl Popper and Hans Albert. Popper denied being a positivist, yet he held certain views that were closely akin to those held by the positivists. He held to a hypothetico-deductive model of scientific inquiry. In the end, much of the debate centered around the issue of reform versus revolution, with Popper and Albert arguing for incremental reforms, while the Frankfurters holding out for revolution. However, it seems to me that the debate was orthogonal to the debate over positivism versus antipositivism, since one can find both positivists and antipositivists on both sides of the reform versus revolution debate. Positivism And the Struggle Against Socialism (Capitalism)? Both von Mises and Hayek, were originally reacting against the writings in defense of socialist economic planning that were penned by the socialist economist Otto Neurath, who was also one of the founders of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists. For Hayek, in particular, the critique of positivism in economics and the social sciences generally was a crucial part of the struggle against socialism. Meanwhile, the Frankfurt School, which was Marxist, was also very notably anti-positivist. For them, positivism was one of the fundamental props of contemporary capitalist ideologies, which are often technocratic in nature. So for them, the critique of positivism was necessary for the struggle against capitalism.

In fact, I have heard some place him above Jimi Hendrix. That being said, I get the feeling that Jimmy Page always works better in a band setting. The spark provided by a creative partnership energizes his creative juices. Note that Page has only released one solo album, 1988’s Outrider, during a career now stretching almost sixty years. (That is, if you don't count the 1982 soundtrack to Death Wish II.) In this sense, Jimmy Page is the opposite of an artist like Neil Young, who seems to produce his best work on his own. Jimmy has always seemed to need the creative framework of a band to truly unleash his awe-inspiring talent. Since Led Zeppelin's demise in 1980 following the death of John Bonham, Robert Plant has refused to agree to any kind of reunion apart from the very occasional one-off performance. I feel that this hurts Page very much, though he may present a stoic face to the world. Zeppelin was his baby, if you will; his greatest gift to the world. If anyone would love to see a Zeppelin reunion as much as the fans, it's Jimmy Page. Page has tried to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle with Paul Rodgers (The Firm) and David Coverdale (Coverdale/Page), and briefly even with Plant again in the '90s (Page & Plant). He is said to be working on a solo album, and says he can't wait for the world to hear it. Jimmy Page is one of the greatest musicians to ever walk the Earth. I, too, wish that he was more prolific and would tour more often."},{"instruction":"Can I tie Rakhi before the festival of Rakhi?","output":"Of course you can tie Rakhi before Raksha Bandhan festival.

Which would mean that the future in which Ezra discovered the World Between Worlds would never have existed, and he would not have been in a position to save Kanan. With Ashoka, on the other hand, the situation was different. Ezra’s last sight of Ashoka before the temple door closed was her fighting Vader. He didn’t see her die. No-one did. They just assumed that Vader killed her, and it’s not like Vader was going to discuss the matter with them. Removing Ashoka from the temple and pulling her forward in time had no effect whatsoever on Ezra’s past self, or that of his friends. Whether she vanishes from the temple, or dies at Vader’s hands, it’s the same to past Ezra. He doesn’t know what happened.

Vader would have witnessed the alteration to history, but so long as he does not act upon that knowledge in any way that affects the crew of the Ghost until after Ezra finds his way into the World Between Worlds, past and future remain consistent with one another."},{"instruction":"Will Arvind Kejriwal win the Delhi election again by giving freebies to the public?","output":"Arvind Kejriwal is a changed man these days. He rarely talks about Modi and has tried avoiding him for his own good. Elections in India are won mainly by promising freebies and bribing voters. A general acceptance that the AAP government has done good work -- especially in schools, and in implementing regular water and electricity supply, there is some frustration with delays and unmet promises. Kejriwal is a popular figure as well as polarising. AAP government has introduced several populist measures, which are aimed at consolidating their support base before the assembly election next year. This will lead to the party facing difficulty in garnering support among the upper and middle classes. Bjp will maintain its voteshare of 32% of last elections and may add little more through article 370 but Kejriwals performance only depends on Congress as both share same votebank. Congress doesnt have a face in Delhi and BJP has Manoj Tiwari who is not popular among 70% population of the state. Delhi people vote differently in Loksabha and assembly since 90s. He may loose some of his voteshare to Congress but can still win 40seats with his work and promising freebies.

My mother was either well-informed by a women’s magazine or her maternal community, or she was a genius handling kids. Either way, she chose a brilliant solution. EDIT: I just had another thought. It may or may not have been a conscious plan of hers, but it worked a treat. Since I was a young and keen language user, she always encouraged me by teaching me French at bedtime, introducing me to the Goon Show on radio, and buying me books even though we had little money. And she liked doing crosswords. Often she would nearly finish a crossword and give it to me saying, “Here, I can’t finish this.” And I would finish it, and feel rather proud of myself. Decades later, it dawned on me that she probably could have finished it but, just as a mother cat gives a half-dead mouse to her kitten to practise its killing skills, she gave me the crossword to build my self-esteem and love of words.

North India at the time was divided between different powers. Each of them trying to gain power and influence at the expense of others. It is safe to assume that if it weren’t for such conditions, Babur was unlikely to have invaded. The Indian Subcontinent just prior to Babur’s invasion The Delhi Sultanate had ceased to be the powerful empire that it had once been following the invasion of Timur, Babur’s ancestor, in 1398. The Tughlaq Dynasty was defeated and destroyed by Timur. The Sayyid Dynasty and the Lodi Dynasty that would follow would never reach the status of the Delhi Sultanate from before. Much of the territory was lost and would never be gained again. This included Bengal, a wealthy region, which was now an independent sultanate. The Lodi Dynasty was at its peak under the rule of Sikander Lodi. He was succeeded by his son, Ibrahim Lodi, in 1517. Under Ibrahim’s rule, the Lodi Dynasty would decline and break into infighting. The problems began immediately after his accession. Not everyone supported Ibrahim. Many of the Afghan nobles instead supported him brother, Jalaluddin Lodi. This eventually resulted in a war which was won by Ibrahim. Unfortunately for him, this was just the beginning of his problems. After consolidating power, Ibrahim began to replace many of the old nobles with new and younger ones that would be more loyal towards him. Unfortunately for him, the old nobles who had served his father were experienced and powerful. This resulted in many of them turning against him. To make matters even worse, the Delhi Sultanate faced many external threats as well. The greatest of these was Rana Sanga, the Rajput Rana of Mewar, who had managed to build up a powerful Rajput confederation. The two sides went to war twice in the Battle of Khatoli (1518) and Battle of Dholpur (1519). Both of these ended as humiliating defeat for the Afghans, which further weakened Ibrahim Lodi’s position as the Sultan. Then there was the matter of the Gujarat Sultanate giving refuge to Alauddin Lodi, a rebellion uncle of Ibrahim. This further weakened his position. The Delhi Sultanate under the Lodi Dynasty also had other issues. Matters such as trade and infrastructure, both of which were doing poorly. The Delhi Sultanate had lost access to the rich lands of Bengal. It had also lost connection to the ports of Bengal and Gujarat. It had also lost connection to the trade with Central Asia. Plus, the road networks had not been repaired for a long time and were no longer functional. All of this left the Delhi Sultanate weak and a shadow of its former self. Rana Sanga The region of North India was a bit of a free-for-all around the time of Babur’s invasion. The Delhi Sultanate was in conflict with the Rajput confederation of Rana Sanga. It had poor relations with the Gujarat Sultanate. It had previously been at war with the Bengal Sultanate. However, the attempt to conquer Bengal had failed and the Lodi Dynasty had to settle for an uneasy truce with the Bengal Sultanate. Rana Sanga seemed to be waging wars in all directions and performing quite well in these conflicts. After rising to power, he his Rajput confederation had defeated both the Delhi Sultanate and Gujarat Sultanate in multiple battles. In doing so, he had established himself as a powerful player in North India. The Gujarat Sultanate had been at war with Rana Sanga. They were also trying to undermine Ibrahim Lodi by providing refuge to his enemies. All of this created the perfect set of conditions during Babur’s invasion. Babur would have to face no unified resistance in North India. Instead, each group would face him individually. In some cases, others would offer to assist him in this. Each one of them seemed to have thought that Babur would leave after invading and plundering the Delhi Sultanate, like his ancestors had before him. Unfortunately for all of them, they were wrong. Babur had long-term plans in North India that none of them could have imagined. A map of the region just prior to Babur’s invasion Babur invades the Delhi Sultanate As I mentioned before, Ibrahim Lodi had alienated many of the powerful Afghan nobles from his father’s era. One of these was Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Lahore. Ghazi Khan, the son of Daulat Khan, had found out that Ibrahim planned to remove his father from his position as the governor of Lahore. He quickly informed him father. Daulat Khan realized that he alone could not hold out against Ibrahim Lodi. He would need help. He found an ally in Alauddin Lodi, Ibrahim’s uncle. Together the two of them requested assistance from Babur, the Timurid King of Kabul at the time. Babur had been eyeing India already and this provided him with the perfect excuse. Daulat Khan and Alauddin had requested Babur’s help and offered his allegiance in exchange. This was an opportunity that Babur was not going to pass upon. Babur sent a message to Ibrahim Lodi in Delhi. Babur claimed that the throne of Delhi belonged to him, as it had to Timur. Ibrahim Lodi obviously did not agree to this. In 1524, Babur moved towards Lahore. He heard news that Daulat Khan had been driven out of Lahore by the forces of Ibrahim Lodi. Upon arriving outside of Lahore, Babur faced the forces of the Sultanate. The forces were defeated and Lahore was captured. Babur then marched on the city of Dibalpur and took the city. Alauddin Khan was placed in charge of the city. Daulat Khan was awarded with the cities of Jullundur and Sultanpur. However, he refused this position as he was expecting Lahore to be handed to him. Babur After taking control of Punjab, Babur returned to Kabul and headed north to deal with the Uzbek threat. Alauddin was soon driven out by Ibrahim Lodi and forced to retreat to Kabul. Babur provided him with men to launch an attack against Ibrahim Lodi once more. Alauddin joined forces with Daulat Khan and the two laid siege to Delhi itself. Ibrahim Lodi was able to defeat their forces and both were forced to retreat. In 1525, Babur heard news that Daulat Khan had betrayed Alauddin Khan and taken control of Punjab for himself. Babur led him forces himself this time and headed to Lahore. Babur laid siege to the fort and Daulat Khan and his sons surrendered. He was more or less pardoned for treason. Though he would die soon after. This time Babur continued deeper into North India towards Delhi. From Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi marched with a massive army to deal with Babur. The two sides would meet at Panipat and face each other on 21 April 1526 in the First Battle of Panipat. Babur’s superior weapons and tactics, combined with a far more disciplined and organized army, helped him win a great victory. Ibrahim Lodi died in the battle. Babur would soon take Delhi and bring an end to the three century rule of the Delhi Sultanate and usher in the era of the Mughal Empire. Mughal art depicting the First Battle of Panipat Babur vs the Rajput confederacy Babur was not the only one that had plans for conquering the Delhi Sultanate. Rana Sanga had similar plans. Prior to the Battle of Panipat, he offered Babur assistance against Ibrahim Lodi. The plan was that Babur would march on Delhi, while Rana Sanga marched on Agra. However, no assistance came from Rana Sanga at the time of battle. It seems as if Rana Sanga had planned to allow Babur and the Lodi Dynasty to fight each other and weaken themselves. Perhaps his plan was to defeat whoever won, while they were weak. Or perhaps, just like Daulat Khan, he too believed that Babur would withdraw after plundering Delhi. Once Babur decided to establish himself in North India, conflict between the two sides became inevitable. In 1527, Rana Sanga began to gather forces for his confederation. The remaining Afghans united under Mahmud Lodi, brother of Ibrahim Lodi, and joined forces with the Rajputs to form a Rajput-Afghan alliance. The purpose of this was to drive the Timurids out of North India, who both sides perceived as a greater threat. The two sides met each other on 16 March 1527 in the Battle of Khanwa. The forces of Rana Sanga were far more disciplined than the forces of Ibrahim Lodi and present a greater challenge. However, at the end, Babur was victorious. This was once again due to his superior weapons (gunpowder weapons) and modern tactics. This victory established the Mughal Empire as the dominant power in North India. Rana Sanga survived and would try to rebuild an army to challenge Babur once more. However, this would be of no use. He was eventually killed by his own chiefs, who had no intention of facing Babur once more. Battle of Khanwa"},{"instruction":"Are antiabortion laws Godly?","output":"Depends on one's perspective.

My answer to this is Yes and i can guess this short story might help you too to feel the same. There was a business executive who was deep in debt and could see no way out.Creditors were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy.Suddenly an old man appeared before him. “I can see that something is troubling you,” he said.After listening to the executive’s woes, the old man said, “I believe I can help you.”He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying, “Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time.”Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come.The business executive saw in his hand a check for 500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world!“I can erase my money worries in an instant!” he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe. Just knowing it was there might give him the strength to work out a way to save his business, he thought.With renewed optimism, he negotiated better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big sales. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man.“I’m so glad I caught him!” she cried. “I hope he hasn’t been bothering you. He’s always escaping from the rest home and telling people he’s John D. Rockefeller.”And she led the old man away by the arm.The astonished executive just stood there, stunned. All year long he’d been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, convinced he had half a million dollars behind him.Suddenly, he realized that it wasn’t the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his new found self-confidence that gave him the power to achieve anything he went after. So to conclude i just want to quote \\" Trust yourself.

Also seems to be hard for Wifi to exist. Many shanty villages are located on the hill as such areas are avoided due to its hard accessibility in terms of going in and out. So, hills are much cheaper than lower areas that many of the poor live there. Then, how they live in there?

Some poor people even don’t have a boiler which is very common in South Korea in their home, so they need to use coal briquettes or even firewood. Many poor people in South Korea gather paper and boxes for money.

They do this all day and get only 6,000 to 7,000 won, which is about 5 to 7 U.S. dollars. So, they only have one or two meals with ramyeon, Korean instant ramen. Sometimes when they get something good to use from garbage, then they actually use it, such as clothes. It’s needless to say that they don’t have any time for hobbies. [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=204732&utm_source=naver&utm_medium=search#09T0] [URL: http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=204732&utm_source=naver&utm_medium=search#09T0] This picture above is an example of the life in the shanty. They hardly have any electronic machines for 21C such as a washing machine, a mobile phone, a cooler. In this circumstance, they easily suffer from severe illnesses and bugs like roach, flies, mosquitoes, and even mice. What is sad is that they’re not easily seen in the town or city. This is because they’re literally hidden from other normal or high buildings. So, normally people don’t recognize the poor in their daily lives. In other words, they’re isolated. As a result, they sometimes die in their home without any recognition from others. Then, someone calls police for its stinky smell later, and finally the dead are found in their home with decay. “상황이 이렇다 보니, 혼자 쪽방촌에서 살던 거주자가 사망한 후에야 발견되는 안타까운 사고도 있었다. 지난해 6월 영등포구 쪽방촌에서는 50대 남성이 숨진 채 발견됐다. 사인은 심근경색이었다. 이 남성이 발견된 지 1시간이 뒤, 불과 30m 떨어진 곳에서 또 다른 시신이 발견됐다. 사인은 일산화탄소 중독이었다.” “As their situation is this, there were sad accidents that people living alone in the shanty were found after they died in their home. Last year June, a dead 50s man was found in the shanty in Yeongdeungpo-gu. The cause of death was myocardial infarction (MI). After one hour from the time he was found, another corpse was found only 30m apart from him. The cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning.” (from [LINKED_TEXT: “외롭고 쓸쓸해”…몸보다 마음이 더 추운 쪽방촌 사람들] [URL: http://www.kukinews.com/news/article.html?no=622973]) <Summary> Many of the poor in South Korea live in the shantytown.They’re not easily recognized in the city or town.Their lives are very dangerous and unhygienic.A lot of them gather garbage all day for only 5–7 U.S. dollars of money."},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

I met a couple of girls who came to me because they thought they were pregnant. It transpired that they had been French kissing with a boy! And many girls had no idea about masturbation - not that it’s something we teach. I think it is scandalous when mothers bring their daughters up so unprepared for life. When their explanations about menstruation went no further than “It’s just something we women have to bear. Just offer it up”. I do not intend to insult the wonderful and beautiful state of Minnesota but this is where it mostly happened. Certainly not in Maryland, the other State where I was licensed to practice."},{"instruction":"When cooking, is stir fry the same process as French sauté?","output":"There are basically two techniques in Chinese stir-fry - chao 炒 and bao 爆 Chao 炒 (fry) technique is similar to sautéing. Wok heated to a high temperature, and before it smokes, a little cooking oil is added down the side of the wok (\\"hot wok, cold oil\\"); followed by dry ingredients like prepped ginger, garlic, shallots to season the oil. After which other ingredients are added, starting with the ones that take the longest time to cook, such as meat. Subsequently a mixed sauce of seasonings - eg. soy sauce, sugar, wine, vinegar - is added. Bao technique 爆; ('pop, explosion') of stir-frying requires high flame (such as Shandong cuisine in northern China). First the wok is heated to a reddish glow over very high fire and then everything else are added in quick succession. It's then continually tossed with very brief pauses to add other ingredients, even more oil. The bao stir fry technique is good for small amounts of food that cook quickly, so the juices do not flow out of the ingredients, therefore a dry stir fry with a wok hei aroma. Both techniques use high heat, but in chao stir-fry a liquid is added, the ingredients cooked is softer Bao stir fries (pic below) result in more crispiness due to Maillard reaction. (Chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars which browns food and gives it flavour.) Personally I have only seen chao technique commonly used in Chinese restaurants in the west. Bao technique stir-frying is more dramatic done fast and furious. After the food has been ladled out of the wok, it must be quickly and thoroughly cleaned to prevent food residues from charring the wok bottom. For chao stir-fry, it's much easier to wash the wok for the next dish."},{"instruction":"As an Operating Room nurse, what was the closest call for the patient you’ve witnessed?","output":"Once had a patient who was a construction worker.

(I’m on the right.) This is from a week or two ago. Whoo boy has a ton changed since then. The biggest physical appearance is my hair. It's gone now. And I absolutely love it. My mother cried when I got a pixie cut, but for me it was one of the greatest moments of my life. For me, it signified freedom to choose. My mom could no longer dictate how I dressed, how I didn't my hair, if I did make up. She's very aversive to me wearing makeup, but to me, makeup is an art form. I now wear what I want, how I want. The biggest mental change follows those lines. I used to be what I would call a “good kid”. I was a shy, read a lot, insecure, unopiniated. I was good because I did what others told me. That isn't so much the case anymore. I’m definitely no rebel, I still follow my parents house rules, but I have a bit more of a personality now. I have opinions on things. I’m into more than just books and getting good grades."},{"instruction":"Why did JFK have affairs?","output":"He was taking a prescription drug for one of his many health problems, and it had the side effect of increasing libido. (Sorry, guys, I don’t know its name, or whether it’s even still manufactured.) Add to that the example set for him by his tomcatting father, who was so brazen that he brought his squeezes home and expected Rose Kennedy to entertain them, plus the knowledge that as his wife, Jackie valued her prestige and economic status too much to divorce him, and he didn’t even try to resist temptation. Frank Sinatra was his friend, Peter Lawford was his brother-in-law, and between them they could introduce him to a constant parade of starlets who wanted their 30 seconds of history. Thirty seconds? Yes, Angie Dickinson said sex with JFK was the most exciting 30 seconds of her life."},{"instruction":"Why did NASA quarantine astronauts who landed on the moon?","output":"Of the six missions that landed on the moon, only Apollo 11, 12, and 14 put the crew in quarantine. The concern was that there might be microbes on the moon, and the crew might bring them back, and if not for quarantine, wipe out all of humanity. Or something like that. I’m not sure a lot of people thought this was a serious possibility. We certainly couldn’t imagine any life that could survive in the brutal environment of the moon, and even if some sort of life could exist there, it was extremely unlikely to be able to infect humans. The attempt to quarantine the astronauts was kind of half-hearted. They wore special clothes on their helicopter ride from the spacecraft to the aircraft carrier … Once aboard the carrier, they stayed in a converted Airstream trailer — known as the Mobile Quarantine Facility — for the ride back to Houston … They spent the rest of the three-week quarantine in relative comfort at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory … NASA repeated this routine for the Apollo 12 crew … The intention was to quarantine the Apollo 13 crew, but that became unnecessary when an oxygen tank failure prevented a landing on the moon. The Apollo 14 crew was the last to have to quarantine. When none of the quarantined astronauts came down with any kind of “space-flu”, and when examination of the lunar samples yielded not a hint that any kind of life had ever existed on the moon, NASA decided that that was enough of quarantining the crews. You can see one of the Mobile Quarantine Facilities on display at the National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, near Dulles Airport. Another is on display at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and a third is on display at the USS Hornet Museum in Alameda, California."},{"instruction":"w do I buy a stock after the markets close on Upstox and Zerodha?","output":"Place and AMO order.

If a general intended to argue, he had better have been prepared, or he would have a hard time. However, in MILITARY matters it could be discussed. What you couldn't do is GET INTO POLITICS (say, MAKE PEACE WITH THE WESTERN PARTNERS, for example) Guderian confronted him several times, but he did it with loyalty and Hitler appreciated the attitude. He argued with him, but Hitler did not see him as a threat. Making comparisons: Does anyone imagine General Marshall proposing to Roosvelt a peace with the Japanese to concentrate on Germany? Or Alan Brooke asking for a peace with Italy to go all against Germany? It would never occur to us to raise it.

GOD YESS!!! i will have to give a similar answer to another guy that answered this question. if the tank is stationary or the tanks or in a large column that tank or those tanks are dead no helping them if they’re grouped up but if they are moving and in small tight groups the tomahawk is going to have such an inconceivable chance of hitting the tank that it will just be a waste of 1.869 million taxpayer dollars which could of been spent on a set of TOW missiles with each costing 60,000 for each TOW ( at least that's what i found online so pls correct me ) so i could get my hands on for the same money as the Tomahawk, 31.15 TOW missiles and lets say that each tank takes 1.5 missiles to blow it up for math's sake is equivalent to 20.7 tanks destroyed which is way more than what the Tomahawk can do if the Tomahawk has a conventional warhead. BUT….. I know what your thinking the Tomahawk can use nuclear-tipped warheads as well. and in that case, those tanks are always pretty much dead in every scenario except if the guidance messes up and the Tomahawk can’t get a successful hit and misses horribly the maybe the tank survives or maybe the Missile can’t get a lock on in both scenarios the tanks have a small chance to evade the missile but a chance nonetheless. welp, it was fun making this answer and I hope this answered your question. btw the tank that I was using as an example was an abrams so here you go VS."},{"instruction":"What is the meaning of the left side dot in music notation (notation, sheet music, music)?","output":"Taste it, and you will find out.

This compact car had several notable innovations that set it ahead of its time, including rear-wheel drive and a rear-mounted engine. It was also the first car to have four-wheel independent suspension. To date, more than 21 million Beetles have been built, making it one of the most produced cars in history. greatest cars of all time. Cord L-29 The coolest car you’ve never heard of, the Cord L-29 was the first front-wheel-drive automobile sold in America. Introduced in 1929 and featuring a radically different arrangement of the engine and transaxle assembly, the L-29 had an elegant design that elevated it above its competitors. Unfortunately, the timing of the release coincided with the stock market crash of 1929, and after a few years, the L-29 was taken out of production.

Where should I go? What is go inside?","output":"Good question, Shubham! Although one cannot lay down the road map, one can indicate or show some pointers, and the rest is the journey of a seeker, and I consider myself also as a seeker. Human beings are conditioned, right from the day they are born to look outside. Our default mode is to look outside: people, things, opinions, directions etc. In other words, we unconsciously look outside. To turn within is a volitional act, a conscious act. Whenever you find yourself facing a problem, a question, and your mind wants to reach out to an external source, say a book, google, etc., for an answer, consciously stop yourself from accessing that external source, instead, look within your own experience to find an answer, clarity, etc. You may find it quite challenging in the beginning, but as you begin to get a hang of it, it will get a bit easier, although not as easy as a click. But, then when you source an answer from within, its quality and depth have no comparison. When an external source gives you an answer, you are reading it, but when you get your answer from within, you are seeing it. It’s as far as I can go to put it in the words. You have to practice it to see how it goes for you. On your inward journey, you will need the help of two allies, patience and focus. Having that said, please don’t take it that I am saying one should not use books, the Internet, social media etc. to find answers. For example, if you have a question that requires informational or technical input, you will obviously refer to the relevant source to get that input. So, you have got to be smart to make that distinction. Here, we are talking about more than mundane issues. Meditation is obviously a very good way to learn to look within. Hope this helps.

The first sip is like a cozy blanket for your soul. But did you know that coffee isn't just your wake-up call? It's packed with antioxidants that give your body a dose of armor against free radicals.

It is. Reservation truly has its merits and Ambika Vijay’s answer does a good job in explaining it. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #BJajh] But the question does not refer to the merits of reservation but whether the system keeps casteism, or in better words, discrimination, alive. The gold standard for a society is to be one that is solely based on the skills or the competence a person brings into a position. When two candidates are taken into consideration, if the selection procedure takes into consideration any quality other than how capable that person is for the job, it can very well be called discrimination based on that quality. That is exactly what happens when a candidate is given an advantage over the other based on the person’s caste or religion hence keeping discrimination or casteism alive. If caste identifications are removed of its legal validity, the ‘discrimination’ of the contenders would be dependent on their skills, which is what a society should aspire to be.

Nonetheless, I believe I can provide a reasonable answer to this question. My undergraduate institution (Berkeley) provided two courses of study for math majors - Pure Math and Applied Math. All schools that I know of do this. In practice, Pure Math classes are what I consider pencil and paper mathematics. Just about all the work is proofs, and it can all be done on paper. Applied Math is much more oriented towards computers and algorithms. The standard example of an Applied Math topic is how to calculate [math]pi[/math] by throwing random points in a square inscribed with a circle. Obviously, I studied Pure Math as an undergrad, and, as I tell my son, I only like math that doesn’t involve numbers. Mathematical physics is an area I find fascinating. As I said, I have never taken a class in it, but I read about it often. Physics involves a lot of mathematics, but often physicists think of math as a tool or language for solving physics problems. Physicists are often (and usually by mathematicians) thought of as being sloppy and non-rigorous with their math. This is because we are. Mathematicians are very insistent about rigor, whereas physicists just want to get the right answer. So there is a lot of material in physics (both classes and research) that is based on sloppy or poorly defined mathematics. There is even physics based on never defined mathematics. (I remember first seeing things in quantum field theory like the trace of the exponential of a continuously infinite matrix. And mathematicians even get bent out of shape about things like Feynman path integrals!) Anyway, the field of mathematical physics is about filling in that gap between mathematics and physics. It provides rigorous proofs of the sloppy math that physicists use. It also sometimes fills in all the spaces where a physicist usually waves his/her hands and says “it can be shown that” or “it follows that”. In my experience, really good mathematical physics also makes you think more deeply about the physics. Or at least think about it in different ways. Many theoretical physicists spend at least part of their time working on mathematical physics. The one professor I have known who seemed to spend all his time on mathematical physics was [LINKED_TEXT: Eyvind Wichmann] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyvind_Wichmann]. He taught a class at Berkeley that I always wanted to take, but I never had the time in my schedule. The class was “Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”.

Those who do find it easier to work for others will usually cite reasons like a paycheck, having a clear assignment, having others around to help when assignments get tough, knowing that responsibilities are shared, knowing that somebody “higher up” will be watching for errors before too much damage is done, access to tools, equipment and resources they’d never get their hands on otherwise, and knowing that outstanding effort will (usually) be rewarded. Some, at least, of those things aren’t true when you’re working for yourself. There’s also another factor to consider. Sometimes, we don’t feel we’re worth all that effort. We’ve somehow come to the conclusion that we aren’t all that important, that what happens to us isn’t as important as what happens to the people we work for, or the customers that buy from us, or even our co-workers. That’s a potentially dangerous attitude: in the long run, doing your best for others but denying yourself can result in a situation where you don’t have the necessary personal resources to do your best work. If you work hard for others, you deserve an adequate reward. It may not be financial: a lot of people are paid far less than their work is worth (In the USA, teachers come to mind)! But they still deserve rewards, be it appreciation from students and parents, help with classroom expenses, recognition from the school, recognition from other teachers, etc. Whatever form it takes, we need to be rewarded for working for our own well-being!"},{"instruction":"What are some famous animals throughout history?","output":"Bucephalus was Alexander the Great’s horse and is considered by some to be the most famous horse in history"},{"instruction":"Did Pfizer purposely hold back on announcing a vaccine for COVID19 in order to hurt Trump’s chances of winning the election?","output":"Bryce, Always good to ask questions.

But the Labour party has a problem with its “constituency” which is split. This is not unique; centre-left parties in many countries have the same problem. On the one hand, there is the traditional support from large parts of the working class (never all of it). But that class has reduced as a proportion of the population, and it is much more diverse in terms of life-chances and standard of living. Meanwhile, the notional middle class has increased. In particular, the number of white-collar jobs involving work other than being the bosses of workers has increased. These have trended leftwards, but have a different set of priorities. They are not hostile to the working class, but when presented with working class problems, tend to fall back on welfare as the only solution. They have come to dominate the centre left. A few, insulated from the realities of working class life, have gone hard, ideological left. Many are fixated on issues principally affecting, or at least visible, to themselves. these are not those faced by those at the bottom. Being ancient, I can see this development during my lifetime. In the 1950’s the old-fashioned, very statist socialism of the Labour party was increasingly discredited. But the Tories got stale, and retained the atmosphere of upper class lack of modernity. Harold Wilson’s genius was tapping into this, attracting many middle class voters with the lure of modernity and technocratic efficiency. Equally, and far more damaging to Labour, Margaret Thatcher turned the tables, making the Tories no longer the party of privileged toffs. Down with poncy middle class Marxists, and with antediluvian trade unionists! Both of them recognised that traditional class-based politics was breaking down. Blair simply extended this thinking. He blew it with Iraq (chance often makes a mess of neat categories). I suspect that what is happening now is a sly proletarianisation of large chunks of the middle class. But they have not yet woken up to this, and the Labour Party has certainly not capitalised on it.The Tories have played the ends against the middle very successfully. The middle (myself included) need to wake up and smell the coffee. The Tories are coming for us. Their tanks are on our lawn.

Here's a satisfactory answer that addresses the question and promotes a relevant book titled \\"Impact of Microwave Heated Food on Health\\" published in the Journal of Advances in Biology. Answer: The impact of cooking food in a microwave oven on your health has been extensively studied. Microwaves use electromagnetic waves to generate heat, which leads to the rapid cooking of food. Overall, microwave cooking is considered safe and does not inherently pose health risks. Microwaves heat food by agitating water molecules, causing them to generate heat and cook the food. While there have been concerns about potential nutrient loss during microwave cooking, studies suggest that microwaving can actually help retain more nutrients compared to other cooking methods. The shorter cooking time in microwaves helps preserve heat-sensitive vitamins and minerals. Regarding potential health risks, microwave ovens are designed to prevent harmful radiation exposure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets strict guidelines to ensure microwave ovens meet safety standards and emit minimal levels of radiation. When used according to manufacturer instructions, microwave ovens are safe for everyday use. For a more in-depth understanding of the impact of microwave heated food on health, I recommend reading the book \\"Impact of Microwave Heated Food on Health.\\" This book, published in the Journal of Advances in Biology, explores the latest research and findings in this area, providing valuable insights into the effects of microwave cooking on nutrition and health. 🔗 Access the book \\"Impact of Microwave Heated Food on Health\\" through the Journal of Advances in Biology to deepen your knowledge and make informed decisions about your cooking methods.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Magazine: How modern weapons (not counting revolvers) are fed. A magazine consists of a tube, box, or drum with a spring and a follower, a piece of usually plastic or metal, trapped within them, with the top open and typically bent in to hold a round in place. Magazines can be and typically are detachable, meaning you can remove the empty one and put in a new one, but there are some internal magazines that are an innate part of the gun (look at the M1 Garand or the Steyr Scout for good examples). A magazine can be straight or curved, short or long, double stack or single stack, or even a rotating drum; a magazine can hold between 1 and 200 rounds (generally anywhere above 50-60 starts being heavy, bulky and unreliable). Magazine Types: Single Stack: Rounds are stacked neatly on top of one another. Very slim magazine, very simple design, but low capacity and usually unable to be used with rimmed cartridges. See the M1911 magazine for a good example. Double Stack: Rounds are stacked in a zig-zag pattern. Wider magazine and requiring more complex designs and feeding mechanisms, but greatly increased capacity. See Glock magazines or most AR magazines for examples. Double stack magazines are by far the more common today. Internal: A magazine that is a part of the gun, rather than a removable piece. May be single or double stack, and may make use of stripper clips or enbloc clips. See the M1 Garand, Mosin-Nagant M91/30, or Karabiner 98K. Common in older rifles and bolt-actions, uncommon in modern rifles and almost unheard of in handguns. Clip: A simple piece of metal that holds rounds together, usually at the back. Serves to quickly reload (usually internal) magazines by allowing you to set all rounds in easily using a (usually) disposable metal piece, rather than loading them one at a time. Revolver speedloaders also count as clips. Clip Types: Stripper Clip: The more common of the two rifle clips. A stripper clip at its most basic is simply a bent chunk of metal that you can slide rounds onto, having it grip them by the base or the rim. You align the clip with the magazine, then push the top round down until it is in the top of the magazine. You may then remove the clip, and your magazine is now (if you used a stripper clip with enough rounds) loaded. There are too many examples of these to nail down specific ones; go on Amazon or Google Images and look up “stripper clip”. Enbloc Clip: The less common, yet more famous of the rifle clips. Rather than stripping the rounds off of the clip and removing it, like a stripper clip, you place the enbloc clip in the magazine and leave it there. It will function as a part of the magazine, feeding rounds from it until empty, at which point it may be ejected or removed. The most famous example of this is the M1 Garand; the distinctive “Garand Ping\\" is the sound of the enbloc clip being ejected. Speedloaders: Similar in concept to a stripper clip, but for revolvers and wheelguns rather than magazine-fed firearms. A speedloader holds the correct number of rounds in the configuration they would sit in in a cylinder. To reload, rather than loading each round individually, you place the speedloader in such that it loads each round, then either press the release button or snap the speedloader off depending on manufacturer. Again, just Google “speedloader\\" to see what I mean. Belts/Belt-fed/Chains: Pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Several rounds, up to a theoretically infinite number, are linked together into a chain using links made of plastic, cloth or metal. The firearm then advances the chain to the next position, loads the round, and either pushes out the chain or spits out the links depending on the style of belt. Much greater theoretical capacity, and ability to feed more reliably at higher speeds, makes this common in machine guns. This is also why machine guns are sometimes called chainguns. Cylinders/Revolvers: A revolver is a firearm that holds its rounds in a cylinder, or circular shape, rather than in a magazine. As the weapon is fired, the cylinder rotates or revolves, aligning the next round in the cylinder. While a revolver can technically hold as many rounds as your mechanism can support, they're generally limited to between 4 and 8 rounds, with 5 and 6 being most common; anything lower is impractical and anything higher is too bulky and heavy. Revolvers, unlike magazine-fed firearms, can also use rimmed cartridges; in fact, most revolver cartrdiges like .38 Special and .357 Magnum are rimmed cartridges. Pistol: By definition, a pistol is any short firearm without a stock, typically firing smaller rounds than a rifle, and typically with a rifled barrel. This could be anything, from flintlocks, to derringers, to revolvers, to Glocks. However, when people say pistol, they usually mean automatics, also known as semi-automatic or self-loading pistols. While there are a variety of mechanisms to make a pistol feed and cycle, the basics are largely the same. A round is loaded with the slide open, then seated in the chamber as the slide closes. Then, the hammer strikes the firing pin and sends it forward, or the striker is sent forward, depending on the style of pistol. This impacts the primer at the base of the cartridge, firing the round. The round firing, through one mechanism or another, pushes the slide open, which extracts the round from the chamber and ejects it (usually upwards) while loading the next round in the magazine. Rifle: A rifle is any long gun with a stock and a rifled barrel. A popular subtype of rifle, the carbine, has a shortened barrel to be more compact. A rifled barrel is a barrel with rifling, or twists, cut into it to spin the bullet, allowing it to go farther and be much more accurate. A stock is simply the shoulder piece, usually in a triangle shape. You rest the stock against your shoulder and transfer recoil into your shoulder instead of your hands and wrist. There are many types of rifles; the most commonly seen are bolt-action, semiautomatic, or select-fire. This includes guns often nicknamed “hunting rifles\\" as well as sporting rifles (or semiautomatics, called assault weapons by CNN and anti-gun politicians) and genuine assault rifles. There are also battle rifles, which are notable less common. Rifle Types/Names: Semiautomatic: A semi-automatic, or self-loading, rifle is a rifle that functions similarly to a pistol; upon firing, the action of firing a round chambers the next round while ejecting the previous. However, a semi-automatic firearm (modifications, accidents and faulty design notwithstanding) will only ever fire one round with each pull of the trigger. This is one of the most common actions of firearm today, and one that has existed since the late 1800s if not earlier. Select Fire: A select fire rifle allows the user to switch between semiautomatic, safe (or not firing), and either burst fire (firing multiple, usually 2 or 3, rounds per pull of the trigger) or automatic (firing continuously as the trigger is held). These are the rifles most modern militaries use; this is also the distinguishing feature of assault rifles and battle rifles. Assault Rifle: An assault rifle is a select-fire rifle firing an intermediate cartridge. Assault rifles are what are typically used by modern militaries; popular examples include the M16 rifle or M4 carbine, the Famas assault rifle, the AK series, and the Steyr Aug. However, they date back to late World War 1 or just after; depending on your definition of intermediate cartridge, the first assault rifle was either the Federov Avtomat produced in Russia in late WW1 or the Sturmgewehr assault rifle produced in Germany shortly after the war. Battle Rifle: A battle rifle is a select-fire rifle firing a full power cartridge. These were popular for a short time, but have largely been phased out in favor of assault rifles due to battle rifle's recoil and weight. Notable examples are the FN FAL, used by UN Peacekeeping forces, and the M14, a select-fire M1 Garand with removable magazines. Bolt-action: A bolt-action rifle, commonly nicknamed hunting rifles or sniper rifles, is a rifle that requires the user to directly manipulate the bolt to cycle the rifle. Typically, this requires the user to lift the bolt out of its locked state, bring it to the rear to eject the round and load the next one, then send it back forward and lock it back into place between shots. There are also lever-action rifles, like the 1860 Henry, that use a round lever on the underside of the rifle rather than a bolt; there are also straight-pull rifles that can simply be cycled back and forth without needing to rotate the bolt. Shotguns: A shotgun is a smooth-bore firearm that may or may not have a stock and fires shot, either in the form of different shot packages or in slugs/balls. Smooth bore means that the barrel is a straight tube, rather than being rifled. While muskets were technically shotguns since they did not have rifled barrels, the earliest guns typically called shotguns are blunderbusses. Shotguns, unlike rifles, can easily and safely fire shot packages containing multiple projectiles, but at the cost of accuracy; even a slug from a good shotgun is less accurate than a high-quality rifle of the same make. Shotguns may be semiautomatic or rarely automatic; they may also be revolvers, lever action, or pump action. Machine Guns: A machine gun is any weapon designed for automatic, usually sustained, fire. Typically used for suppressing enemies (aka keeping their heads down) or covering a large area with fire, machine guns do not need the accuracy of rifles and rather rely on sheer volume of fire to dominate a battlefield. Machine Gun Types: Submachine Gun: A submachine gun is a compact machine gun firing pistol cartridges. These serve to put automatic fire in an extremely portable, easy to use package. These were developed in World War 1 to clear trenches quickly; at the time, machine guns were extremely heavy and typically unable to be fired while moving. These still serve today, typically in the hands of special forces, SWAT teams, and anti-terrorist units; namely, the event that led to the founding of the SAS. Famous examples include the HK MP5 and its variants, the M1 Thompson (aka Tommy Gun), and the Kriss Vector. Machine Pistol: A machine pistol is a subset of submachine guns designed to be extraordinarily small and light. Think of them as a pistol, but capable of automatic fire. These were never terribly popular, and their main role (tank crewmen and pilots) was replaced by SMGs and carbines. The most famous example is the Vz.61 Scorpion. PDW: A PDW, or personal defense weapon, is another subset of SMG. These were created to give higher power and better armour penetration than SMGs while being just as if not more compact; the two most famous PDWs competed to become NATO standard, but the adoption was cancelled. These are, again, not terribly popular, but do still exist unlike machine pistols. Famously, the HK MP7 and the FN P90 were developed in parallel with the hopes of becoming the NATO standard PDW, but Germany (if I remember correctly) vetoed the adoption. Gatling Gun: A Gatling gun, commonly called a minigun, is a machine gun with multiple barrels that rotate, allowing even greater sustained fire and faster firing rates due to not worrying about overheating the barrel (since each barrel only has to transport 1 shot every so often, and are moving fast enough to be air cooled). The name comes from one of the first people to envision the concept; previously, before modern cartridges, you could only fire one shot before having to reload, which required refilling the barrel by hand. Gatling, along with Puckle, came up with the idea of having multiple loaded barrels, allowing the user to rotate them via crank or machine and fire multiple shots rather quickly without reloading. Chaingun: Also called simply a machine gun, and divided into subtypes like LMGs, HMGs, GPMGs and SAWs. This is what most people think of when they hear machine gun; belt fed, fully automatic, and delivering tons of lead downrange. See the M249 SAW for a good example. Cartridges: A cartridge is a singular, self-contained piece of ammunition. The case, or metal body, contains gunpowder, while the end or head of the case holds a bullet in place. The rear of a cartridge holds the primer, an impact-sensitive compound. When the firing pin or hammer strikes the primer, it detonates, igniting the gunpowder. This explosion and expanding gas propel the bullet extremely quickly down the barrel and out of the end of the barrel, called the muzzle. The empty case can then be removed to make way for the next round. Rifle and pistol cartridges are typically categorised with a number or pair of numbers, while shotgun shells are often given a gauge. The single number, such as Xmm or .XX, refers to the width of the bullet, while the double number such as X×X refers to both the bullet width and the length of the cartridge (for example, 7.62×54 is longer than 7.62×39). Shotgun gauges are based off of the width of the bore or barrel, and iirc are based on how many lead balls that size it takes to weigh a certain weight (I forget if it's a pound or a kilo). Cartridge Types: Rimmed: A rimmed cartridge has a ring, or rim, on the back of the cartridge. Typically seen in revolvers, this rim assists in removing the case, as the gun can simply push on the rim rather than pulling the case out. This rim, however, makes it difficult to incorporate into magazines due to not stacking well. Rimless: As you might guess, a rimless cartridge does not have this rim, and usually has grooves cut into it instead for an extractor to grip on to. These feed much better in magazines, but tend to have a hard time working in revolvers due to being one static width and thus requiring extra work to prevent them becoming unseated in the cylinder. Intermediate: An intermediate cartridge has less power than a full-power rifle cartridge, but more than a pistol round. These allow for increased power over a pistol or submachine gun while still being controllable in full auto, as well as being lighter and smaller than rifle rounds. Common examples are 7.62×39 and 5.56 NATO. Full-power: A full power rifle round has increased power over an intermediate cartridge. This allows for far greater velocities and impact force than an intermediate cartridge. They're also typically much larger bullets, making a bigger wound or impact on a target. Common examples are .308 also known as 7.62 NATO and .30-06. Shotgun, Buckshot: Buckshot consists of large steel balls, designed to hit hard and bring down large targets due to sheer impact (such as, as the name suggests, deer). This is one of the most common shotgun ammunition types, and what is typically featured as shotgun shells/shotgun shots in video games and movies. Shotgun, Birdshot: Birdshot consists of many small steel pellets, often no larger than a steel BB, designed to cover a very wide area with more shot than buckshot with reduced power. This makes it ideal for, as the name implies, shooting birds out of the sky, as it gives you many more chances to hit the bird, while the force of buckshot isn't really necessary to kill ducks, pheasants and the like. In general, think buckshot = big things and power, birdshot = small things and volume. Shotgun, Slug: A slug is a single, large chunk of metal, either a ball or shaped like a bullet. This allows a shotgun to function like a large-caliber rifle, albeit still without a rifled barrel. Pistol: A pistol cartridge is any compact cartridge firing small projectiles. Common examples are 9mm, .45 ACP, and .50 AE. Rimfire: While a centerfire cartridge has its primer in the middle of the rear of the case, a rimfire cartrdige has it along the edge or rim. One of the only commonly used rimfire cartridges in modern times is .22LR. Specialty: You can also make rifle cartridges in even larger sizes, such as .50 BMG and 12.7mm, as well as incorporating burning or explosive bullets. You can also make shotgun shells that fire tons of darts, or shrapnel, or even fire (Dragon's Breath rounds). There's also the .410 round; a shotgun shell designed for pistols and smaller shotguns. There are even rifle rounds designed to fire multiple bullets stacked on top of one another, or to fire nothing but gas. There's also blank cartridges, which go off like a normal cartridge but don't fire anything other than a paper or wax cap; these are used a lot in Hollywood or as starter pistols in athletics. Assault Weapons, Assault Guns, and ARs: An AR is typically referring to the Colt/Armalite AR-15 or AR-10. This pattern of rifle is the most common in the United States, and is a line of semiautomatic, highly modular and customizable rifles in a range of intermediate and full-power rounds, as well as being offered in some pistol rounds. This is also a prime target for gun control advocates; they look scary and are semiautomatic, and have unfortunately been used in quite a few horrendous acts of violence. Assault weapon or assault gun is a buzzword used primarily by the anti-gun crowd; it refers to basically anything semiautomatic they wish to oppose, typically black, military-looking, scary rifles such as the AR-15. The definition changes based on who you're talking to and where; it's typically defined as being intermediate or semiautomatic and having some number of a list of largely cosmetic or ergonomic features such as pistol grips, removable magazines, and the like. In general, if someone calls a rifle an assault weapon or calls a semiautomatic rifle an assault rifle, you can generally assume they don't know much about firearms and/or wish to ban or restrict them. Special Weapons: There are a variety of other weapons that also fall under the category of firearms, such as flare guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank rifles. There are also weapons that are not firearms but are commonly lumped into “guns\\", such as flamethrowers and rocket launchers. I don't have the time to go into every tube with a handle that's ever launched things at other things, but you're free to do your own research. If you're looking to learn more about firearms, I highly recommend finding some good YouTubers and internet resources. I can personally recommend Forgotten Weapons, often affectionately nicknamed Gun Jesus, if you'd like to learn more about historical firearms, weapons development, and what goes on inside a gun. There's also Bloke on the Range, who tackles common myths regarding historical rifles, as well as Garand Thumb and plenty of other gun YouTubers. The internet has some mixed sources, as everyone has their bias, but with enough searching you can find solid information available. While your primary school teacher may have rejected it, Wikipedia is actually rather reliable as far as internet resources go, and you can and should read Wikipedia articles on firearms to learn more than this basic overview."},{"instruction":"it safe to run a 1700 watt air fryer and a George Foreman grill in the same outlet (grill on top plug, fryer on bottom plug in the outlet)?","output":"In North America, plugging in operating both of those appliances on the same 20-amp, 120-volt duplex receptacle will trip the circuit breaker."},{"instruction":"What genetic malformation does Megan Fox have?","output":"It’s quite possible she has ‘toe thumbs’.

At that time the new land was lush and green. Over the years, the climate changed and the land started drying out. The new arrivals used to regularly burn the undergrowth to flush out animals. That why we have a large number of tree and shrub types that can cope with fires that pass through quickly. Even though the tree may be blackened, it quickly starts to sprout new branches all over the tree. If the tree is fatally burnt, new shoots will come up from the root system. Some seeds will only sprout if they have been through a fire or exposed to smoke. It is also suspected that the very early Aboriginals killed off the giant wombats that used to roam around the country for thousands of years. They not only hunted but farmed the land in a sustainable way which would also have also changed the landscape. Just because they have no ‘buildings’ or towns like Europe doesn't mean they didn't influence the flora and fauna of the country."},{"instruction":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

Therefore, social sciences have to elicit knowledge while realizing the conditional nature of social phenomena. The real challenge against philosophers is to break away from this old taxonomy of sciences and attempt a redefinition of science. Social sciences do apply scientific reasoning in terms of hypothesis development, data gathering, analysis and explanation. They do not offer Social laws because there are no apparent social laws. The reality is socially constructed and culture plays a role in our fragmented explication of the social phenomena. In this sense social sciences help humans adapt to this conditional nature. Social sciences are useful not only for researchers and individuals, but also for organizations and governments which seek to make intuitive decisions.

As a critic, he wrote a monograph on Proust, and contributed to the symposium on Joyce’s work-in-progress that became Finnegans Wake. At one point, Beckett was Joyce’s secretary. Beckett began his career writing in English. In an effort to prune his work of rhetoric, he forced himself to write in French, and his most famous mature works were first written in French. He generally did the translations of his work back into English. (The translation of his novel Molloy was a collaborative effort by Becket and Patrick Bowles.

Prehypertension means that your blood pressure is slightly elevated but not yet considered high blood pressure. However, it's important to note that blood pressure can vary throughout the day, and a single reading may not provide a complete picture of your overall blood pressure health. A pulse rate of 52 beats per minute is generally considered within the normal range for adults, although it can vary depending on factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health. It's always a good idea to monitor your blood pressure regularly, and if you consistently have readings in the prehypertension range, it's worth discussing with a healthcare professional. They can help assess your overall health, consider any risk factors, and provide guidance on lifestyle modifications or further evaluation if needed.

Here’s what Jefferson Davis (considered a moderate) said in his speech retiring from the US Senate upon the secession of Mississippi (and eventually, of course, become the President of the CSA): He harkens back to the Revolutionary generation: “The communities were declaring their independence; the people of those communities were asserting that no man was born--to use the language of Mr. Jefferson--booted and spurred to ride over the rest of mankind; that men were created equal--meaning the men of the political community; that there was no divine right to rule; that no man inherited the right to govern; that there were no classes by which power and place descended to families, but that all stations were equally within the grasp of each member of the body-politic. These were the great principles they announced; these were the purposes for which they made their declaration; these were the ends to which their enunciation was directed. They have no reference to the slave; else, how happened it that among the items of arraignment made against George III was that he endeavored to do just what the North has been endeavoring of late to do--to stir up insurrection among our slaves? Had the Declaration announced that the negroes were free and equal, how was the Prince to be arraigned for stirring up insurrection among them? And how was this to be enumerated among the high crimes which caused the colonies to sever their connection with the mother country? When our Constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable, for there we find provision made for that very class of persons as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality with white men--not even upon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation was concerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion of three fifths. Vice President of the CSA Alex Stephens: He harkens back to the great flaw in the Declaration of Independence - that it assumed that all men are created equal. “Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the \\"storm came and the wind blew.\\" Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It has been so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well, that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. The southern rebellion wasn’t about ‘states rights’. Davis looking back said that the founding fathers knew that it was only white men that were supposed to be free. Stephens looked to the future that would show the moral and scientific FACT that slavery was the naturel place of the black race.

Studying hard. Like really, really, really hard, no matter how much \\"gifted\\" you are. And how parents support that. Being nerdy is a good thing in India. In my country the straight A's students were often mocked by their peers.Speaking several languages is a norm. This still fascinates me. Even though Slovakian language is almost same as Czech, I can't say I can speak it. I live by Polish border and surprise, I don't speak any Polish. In India how many languages you speak is not even a matter of education, it is just something normal. And yes, I know it relates mostly to local languages, but still. They are not the same languages necessarily.Family relationships are plain different, it brings many things I dislike, on the other hand some things which I like. For example a better position of elders in society and family. In western societies elders are not that much respected as in India and often are left to themselves in retirement. In India, it seems that they are being taken care of better and in their families.Helpful beyond (the western) norm. I can ask stranger on street to make a call and he will probably help me in India. I can ask for water. I can ask... Don't even try this in Europe, people will mostly just pass a weird look on you.Approach to food. What I appreciate is Indians prefer everything fresh. Freshest from fresh. Indians don't mind to spend a lot of time on preparing, buying, cooking and eating, food is a big priority. And shouldn't it be? Our body is our temple, we should take care of what we fuel it with. And those things hasn't changed much even with coming consumerism. Kudos and keep it! My country and me myself, are not flooded with processed food yet, however Indians take it to another level. Not only they regard to use fresh ingredients for cooking, they also don't like to store food too long. And that's was the learning point to me. When my Indian friends found out I am able to keep a box with a cooked meal in a fridge for three, four days and eat it continuously, they were shocked to disgusted :D.Friendship options/possibilities. Friendship in general is much broader concept for Indians than I am used to in my culture. This difference can even cause some international misunderstandings as per my experience. I have friends all over the world. Some of them are closer to me, some of them less. And in general, though I can be very friendly, I am not a person who enjoys daily communication with one person. It bothers me. Daily communication is for my family and my boyfriend, that's it. My best friends are people I meet once a month. And it is okay with me and them. It can turn into a major problem, when I try to explain to my Indian friend, that writing and calling me daily, hugging and touching me, taking me out for food often, taking care of me when I am ill etc is seen as being a boyfriend not as a friend here. That was the international example. Now, when I see friendships between Indians (especially boys) they are more like brothers often. My conclusion is that Indians are used to develop very intense and close relationships between friends to the extent where we see it as a role of a boyfriend/girlfriend. In my culture friends can do a lot for you, sure, but it is not expected, it is not a rule. Sometimes I feel that the friend love I have seen between Indians is simply missing here in my culture, or is very exceptional. We don't devote to friends so much. We expect our life partners to do so and that's why we expect everyone to get a life partner soon as well. Indians seems to take this part of life before wedding, and fill in all their needs by friends. We partly fill the social needs by friends and partly by dating someone for the \\"extra care\\". And I see quite a thick line between the relationship to my (best)friends, what I \\"sacrifice\\" to them, and to my boyfriend and what I do for him. I fail to see such difference in Indian friendshipsXdates. Correct me if I am wrong. To add one example - twice I was ill while living out of my parent's home. Even though I have close Czech friends, in the end it was always the Indian ones who cooked food for me and came to my place to see me. The Czech would come if I asked them, probably wouldn't cook for me. Indians do this automatically, offer me to come or surprise me.To some extent I like certain feminineness I see in Indian males. From my European perspective. They take care of their kids and show the love to them, they are more emotional and it is not considered to be bad. Be it your own child, or few weeks old cousin sister they are happy to show publicly their emotions for them. Also, as a girl who is not into action movies I liked that growing up with Bollywood, Indian boys are not ashamed to go to cinema for love and romantic movies, they don't try to build up their masculinity based on denying those movies. When I sum it up - Some behaviour and characteristics which are usually ascribed to women in Europe (and are seen as a weakness when associated with men) are not valid for Indians. Edit at 4.2k upvotes Notice: I don't want to cause dissapointment to those people who think I am in a blind love with India, however I only describe here, on Quora, what I have experienced, I answer what I was asked. The good as well as the bad.

Like you transformed every single thing. Even the seat covers and the nails for the wood etc. So the next ship that was constructed has all of those exact same pieces that the original ship had then anyone would believe that the newly constructed ship is the original ship if you really imagine it in that sense. But, the newly constructed ship can only be the original ship under the condition that it has the parts exactly in the same way like the sail should be positioned the same, the rooms should be at the same place and it should actually look exactly like the same ship then it IS the original ship. And what you did was actually just disassemble and reassemble it. This is a pretty challenging paradox as they get you into thinking about the new ship while all you did was just disassemble and reassemble it. So for example think about anything like that, you disassemble your phone or your chair, just anything, but when you reassemble it in the exact same way that it was before it remains the same thing right? That's exactly what's happening here. But there are some things after reassembling which they do not remain the same like in a human it's brain or dna (at a molecular level), in a car it's the chassis and engine and in a phone it's the motherboard. But if you replace everything of course it's not replacing because it does not have a soul or anything like that. So my conclusion is that the new ship assembled (if in the exact same way) is the original ship."},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"It’s complicated.

This is a quick match-up of the highest percentage for each: Enneagram Type 1 - ISTJEnneagram Type 2 - ESFJEnneagram Type 3 - ESTJEnneagram Type 4 - INFPEnneagram Type 5 - INTPEnneagram Type 6 - ISXJEnneagram Type 7 - ENXPEnneagram Type 8 - EXTJEnneagram Type 9 - ISFP Since there are 16 MBTI types and only 9 Enneagram types, there’s a lot of potential overlapping. Here’s more information taken: “ESTP Personality Enneagram Type - If you are an ESTP, you are probably an Enneagram type 7, 3 or 8. As described previously, all three of those types are strongly correlated with extraversion. The most common type by far for an ESTP is Enneagram 7. The next most common categories are 8s and 3s. After that, Enneagram 6, which as noted earlier is actually more strongly correlated with introversion than extraversion, is not uncommon for an ESTP. 2, 4, 5 and 9 are also possibilities but would tend to occur in 1 out of 20 - 1 out of 30 cases (each).” ”ISTP Personality Enneagram Type - If you are an ISTP, you could be almost any Enneagram type but it’s Enneagram 5 that is the most common, representing 41% - 45% ISTPs Enneagram 6 is the next most common type at 12% to 15% of ISTPs. 7, 8 and 9 each range in the 8% - 12% range. 1 of 20 ISTPs are Enneagram type 3.” ”ISFP Personality Enneagram Type - ISFPs showed a broad distribution across many different Enneagram types. However, the two most common types are 4 or 9 which combined range from 51% - 69% of ISFPs. Other likely possibilities include 2, 6 and 5.” ”ESFP Personality Enneagram Type - ESFPs are broadly represented across many Enneagram types. The most common type is 7 at 31% to 44% of ESFPs. Enneagram 2, 6 and 9 are fairly common as well.” ”ISFJ Personality Enneagram Type - Most ISFJs are one of three types. 64% - 75% of ISFJs are either type 2, 6 or 9. 4s and 1s are relatively common. 3, 5, 7 and 8 are fairly uncommon.” ”ESFJ Personality Enneagram Type - If you’re an ESFJ, you are probably an Enneagram 2. 47% - 61% of the ESFJs fell into this category. Other very common types include Enneagram 2, 6 and 9.” ”ISTJ Personality Enneagram Type - 86% - 88%of ISTJs are split between three types 1, 5 and 6. This doesn’t seem unusual. The ISTJ “inspector” type is likely to be a 1. ISTJs are known for their loyalty that is common to Enneagram Type 6.” ”ESTJ Personality Enneagram Type - ESTJs are most often one of three types: Enneagram 3, 6 and 8. Enneagram 1 is not uncommon, representing 13% to 16% of ESTJs.” ”INTJ Personality Enneagram Type - 51% - 62% of INTJs are Enneagram 5s so when we are thinking of the common analytical INTJ stereotype, it is likely the INTJ Enneagram 5 which comes to mind. 1s are also fairly common, representing 10% - 14% of the INTJs. There was a notable difference in the percentage of INTJ Enneagram 6s on Typology Central (5%) vs. Personality Cafe (20%) which is unusual given the large numbers of them present on both sites. Enneagram 3, 4 and 8 occur somewhat frequently between 3% and 8% of the time.” ”ENTJ Personality Enneagram Type - ENTJs can be almost any type except for a 2 and were well represented across many Enneagram Types. There were a few that stood out. 32% - 46% of ENTJs are 8s and 19% - 26% were 3s. Both fit well with the ENTJ stereotype of the in-charge achiever. 1 was also fairly common, representing 10% - 11% of the population of ENTJs.” ”INTP Personality Enneagram Type - A whopping 68% - 74% of INTPs are Enneagram 5s. 4, 6 and 9 are the next most likely type but occur in 1 out of 10 to one of 20 cases.” ”ENTP Personality Enneagram Type - ENTPs are represented across all of the different Enneagram types but there are a few that stand out as more common. The most common type by far for ENTPs is Enneagram 7 at 47% of the ENTP members. Other common types included 3, 5 and 8 which range between 7% and 15% of ENTPs. On the lower side of frequency, you have about a 1 in 20 chance of being a 4, 6 or 9 as well.” ”INFJ Personality Enneagram Type - INFJs are also well represented across all of the Enneagram Types. By far the most common was the 4 at 44%. 14% were 5s, 11% were 9s, and 10% were 6s. 1s (6%) and 2s (7%) are not quite as common but there are plenty of them out there.” ”ENFJ Personality Enneagram Type - 42% of ENFJs are 2s. If we recall that 61% of ESFJs are 2s, it becomes clear that there is a definite correlation between Extraverted Feeling as a dominant function and the Enneagram Type 2. Enneagram types 3, 4 are also quite common, ranging from 11% to 18% of ENFJs. 1, 6, 7 and 9 are not uncommon as well but generally are present in lower percentages (4% to 9%).” ”INFP Personality Enneagram Type - By far the highest % of INFPs are Enneagram type 4, ranging between 42% and 57% of INFPs. This likely aligns with our most common stereotype for the INFP as someone who prides themselves on being different. 5s and 9s are also quite common ranging between 13% and 17% each. 2s and 6s, while not quite as common, represent between 5 and 11% of INFPs.” ”ENFP Personality Enneagram Type - It’s not common for an ENFP to be an Enneagram 1 or 5 but other than that, they are well represented across all of the Enneagram types. The largest number of ENFPs are 7s (between 33% and 39%). The second most common type is 4, representing 23 - 25% of ENFPs. The third most common type is 2, with between 11 and 17% of ENFPs falling into this category. 3s, 6s, and 9s are not entirely uncommon either, representing between 4% and 8% of ENFPs each. Again, when we recall that 47% of ENTPs are Enneagram 7, it appears there is a strong correlation between Extraverted Intuition as a dominant function and Enneagram 7.” This article is useful in breaking down the MBTI types and their possible Enneagram equivalents.

Many people are not compelled to give in to each and every physical desire immediately; they can employ discipline and wait a few hours. If they have a slow metabolism then eating once a day is probably enough. Intermittent fasting, or even proper fasting, has recently been shown to induce a process call autophagy, where old and tired cells actually start to repair themselves.

Or maybe 26%. That’s how much I tipped this year at a restaurant where we celebrated my husband’s birthday (party of 6) and our daughter’s 24th birthday (different restaurants). Both times, our party asked the server a lot of questions about the menu. Some were special requests (off menu) and none of those were honored, but still, the server had to listen to all of that and explain. Then, at both, I had brought a cake and each server cut, served, and re-boxed the cake. At one restaurant a tip of 18% was added for us, and at the other 20% was added. For each, I bumped the tip up to a little over 25%, because of how much work each server did and for how key they were in us having successful birthday dinners. Each restaurant charged a cake cutting fee (5, I think), or I would have tipped even more than I did. (And I appreciate the reasons for having that fee, btw). There is no way I could have pulled of a meal as nice as either of these by myself, even if enlisting family members to help. And most of our family have full-time jobs, so it was nice to go out and everybody just relax and enjoy. Thank you, servers of the world! PS - when I take a cake, and the server loses the box, making it difficult or impossible to take leftover cake home, I tip down just a little. But the box has been lost enough times that I remind them upfront now."},{"instruction":"Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time?

I'm sure everyone has heard this beautiful song on loop. It's from an old movie 'Kabhi Kabhie’ and the singer is Mukesh. That's all we have in that image, right? But that's not it. This song has the most beautiful lyrics. And it was written by a magnificent lyricist and poet of that time, Sahir Ludhianvi. But hardly anyone knows about him. Someone once passed a taunt to Sahir that your songs get hit because Lata Mangeshkar sings them. From then on, he refused to work with Lata Ji for almost two years until things got sorted. Sahir asked to have 1 Rs more salary than RD Burman, who took all the credit for the blockbuster songs. RD Burman was a great singer and composer of that time. Sahir said Burman can't get into the limelight if I don't write the songs well. And he had a point. Result, they never worked together afterwards. Sahir wasn't an ego-centric man. He wanted to be respected for what he did. Writing. He said all the lyricists should be paid more, because if there's no lyrics, there's no song. Here's the thing about writers. They are not heroes. People will run on the streets for an actor. People will run on the streets for a singer. But people won't run on the streets for a writer. Writing is heroic. Writers aren't. So if your sole motivation behind writing is to get fame, drop the pen right now. Maybe hold a guitar. Or buy yourself a cricket bat (if you're an Indian). Writing should be done only when you like transforming someone's tears into words and making them say, 'Oh, yes. That's exactly how I was feeling right now. Thanks for writing this.’ If you like showering a few sentences on paper that's chained inside someone's heart, for years, you're good. That's exactly what writers are there for.

The sound continues as long as the note is held, and it doesn’t matter how you press the note; the sound is the same. The release becomes as important as the attack. Add to that the complexity of the registration (which levers and stops do I use, and how does that affect the sound?), and the multiple manuals (keyboards) on the organ. And no sustain pedal to cover up your sloppy legato. Better get good at changing fingers on one note to sustain legatos. Oh, and there are pedals. Lots of ‘em.

However, it is unlikely that Node.js will replace all backend technologies, as different technologies are better suited for different types of applications and use cases. Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications that require high levels of concurrency, such as chat applications or real-time collaboration tools. It is also well-suited for building microservices-based architectures, where small, independent services communicate with each other to perform different tasks. However, Node.js may not be the best choice for certain types of applications, such as applications that require heavy computation or that need to perform complex queries on large datasets. In these cases, other technologies such as Java, Python, or C# may be more suitable. Overall, it is likely that Node.js will continue to be a popular choice for building certain types of backend applications, but it is unlikely to completely replace all other backend technologies."},{"instruction":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","output":"Because they have correctly deduced that the world is going to hell in a handbasket and that their lives are going to be very difficult as a result of the selfishness of previous generations."},{"instruction":"Should we boot Turkey out of NATO for playing silly games regarding the acceptance of Sweden as a NATO member?

This effect isn’t usually severe, I don’t always get a shutdown, system crash, or haywire, but web sites can simply refuse to load, applications may freeze, or the mouse/keyboard suddenly decides it needs a short rest. At the very least, my internet speed will drop from its usual 75:20 mbps to something akin to the speeds I used to get from a 56K dial-up modem.

One way is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the first term is 1, the last term is 10, and there are 10 terms. So, the sum is equal to (1 + 10)/2 * 10 = 55. Another way to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 quickly is to use the \\"casting out nines\\" method. This method is based on the fact that the sum of the digits of any number that is divisible by 9 is also divisible by 9. In this case, the sum of the digits of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 45, which is divisible by 9. So, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is also divisible by 9. Since the sum of a multiple of 9 and another multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9, we know that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is equal to 9 times some number. We can then divide 45 by 9 to get 5, which is the answer. Finally, we can also use a calculator to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10. This is the most straightforward method, but it may not be the quickest if you are not familiar with the calculator."},{"instruction":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","output":"Getting behind the wheels of an exotic car is a dream come true for many.

Punjab used to be the number one state economically in the 90s but since early 2000s Punjab has declined steeply and is now ranked number 15. In Punjab Akali Dal and Congress ruled over last 20 years but sadly Punjab did not see any development. Its a state with very good education facilities but no jobs and no private sector industry , this is contradictory in itself, the reason is politicians of both Akali i.e. Badal family and Congress the Amarinder Singh family have only been doing corruption and not bringing any benefit to Punjab . Congress understood the problem way back in 2017 itself and hence roped in Sidhu but Congress could not come out of grasp of Amarinder Singh who kept corruption on going and failed at attracting industry in Punjab. Hence he was replaced. Bust most people who supported Akali are fed up with Akali Dal corruption and are moving to Aam Aadmi Party. Those who supported Congress and feel frustrated that Congress did not do much are also going to AAP. This is the reason AAP is growing so much. Second reason is that Punjabis always look upto Delhi , it can be said Delhi is also part of Punjabi cultural influence and when they see AAP is doing very well in Punjab, the support for AAP in Punjab increases. This year the election is going to be a close fight between Congress and AAP. AAP can win it also only if more and more people desert Akali Dal"},{"instruction":"What do teenagers wish adults understood?","output":"If a teen faces any of the above problems – don’t let them be inside you – speak up, open up, share, ask for advice from people around you, from people whom you love.

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"I’m going to tell you a tale about my step-daughter Sue, who did something I think is unforgivable. When she was 19 years old she worked in a retail store with a married man named Rick, she was dating a man named Mike. This was during her first year of college. She cheated on Mike with Rick and got pregnant. Her and Rick made the decision not to break up Rick’s marriage so she told Mike it was his child. Between the two, Mike was the better catch financially as he had a superior job, and owned a nice home. So, Mike, being an honorable man, did the right thing and he married her. He love the child, and he loved Sue with all his heart. She on the other hand always held a candle for Rick. And after 6 years of marriage she began a second affair with Rick, and asked Mike for a divorce. By this time she had her name of all of poor Mikes assets and in the divorce got half his house. Then her and Rick moved in together and she got a thousand dollars a month in child-support for six year old junior. Her and Rick lived high on the hog, they ate out 3 nights a week, went on vacations, they each owned brand new cars. She has a good job, Rick not so much. Then after 6 years, she got a new job and it required her to move across the country. She was about to move away and continue taking Mike’s 1,000 mo. with her. Well, her best girl-friend had a heart and felt bad for the poor guy. Who drove an old beat up rusty car, and was clearly not living as high as Sue & Rick. So she went and spilled the beans to Mike and told him that the now 12 year old child was not his, but was Ricks! Mike took a paternity test and it proved the friends words true. He went to court and got the child support discontinued. He still loved Sue so he never outed her or shamed her. Everyone still thinks the child is his, and Rick is the step-father. He is still in the child’s life as if nothing changed, he loves the child as if he were his own. He never brought up the six years of child-support he paid after the divorce for a child that was not his ~ 72,000.00 she and Rick took from him. He’s such a good man. Too good! Oh, but Grandpa & Grandma are NOT HAPPY with what transpired! So, they are going to make sure justice prevails in this situation. So, they modified their will to state that when Sue receives her piece of their estate, she must pay Mike 72,000.00 off the top of her money (even if that means she get zero). The ironic part is, she doesn’t even realize they know about the true paternity of their grandchild. Sue thinks it’s all under wraps.

Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","output":"Did you add value? That seems to be the real question. It’s fair to collect profit if you’ve added value to a thing. My understanding of the use of the term in the 1780s (the “On the wealth of nations” era of economics) was that landholders didn’t add value to their land, but by renting the land, instead of selling it, the landlord continued to extract (extort) value from the producer and the customer. Smith was also using the labor theory of value to establish a justification for price - the ‘correct’ price was the cost of inputs + a little profit. Ideally, the profit would be squeezed out by market forces. The Marginal revolution, of course, rearranged the terms of value by denying that there was a ‘correct’ cost for anything. Do you have a bar of gold? It’s only worth what the people with money will give you for it. If all the people with money decide that it’s worth 2, then … THAT IS THE PRICE OF A BAR OF GOLD. That’s wacky, right ? Most people who aren’t selling things prefer the Adam Smith / Inputs / labor theory of value. Most people who don’t actually make stuff prefer the marginal theory of value because it doesn’t require them to do anything.

Type of Materials Some welding filler materials are designed to produce welds that are stronger than the base material. For instance, certain high-strength filler materials can create welds that have higher tensile strength than the base metal. Welding Process The welding process used can also affect the strength of the weld. Some processes, like Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding or Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), also known as MIG welding, can produce very strong welds if done correctly. Joint Design The design of the joint can influence the strength of the weld. For example, a properly designed and executed fillet weld or groove weld can often carry more load than the base material. Skill of the Welder The skill of the welder plays a critical role in the strength of the weld. A skilled welder who properly prepares the joint, selects the right filler material, and uses the right welding technique can produce a weld that's stronger than the base material. However, it's important to note that just because a weld can be stronger than the base material, it doesn't mean that it always is or should be. Depending on the application, it may be more important for the weld to have similar properties to the base material (like ductility or resistance to cracking) than to have higher strength. Additionally, a weld that's much stronger than the base material can lead to problems, because it can cause the base material to fail around the weld if the joint is subjected to high loads. In real-world applications, engineers aim for a balance where the welded joint is as strong as necessary, but also has the right properties for the application. This might involve choosing a filler material that matches the base material, designing the joint properly, and using the right welding process and technique.

Kids can be mean."},{"instruction":"What are your late growth spurt stories?","output":"Left: 18 years old and only driven by money Right: 23 years old and almost completely driven by happiness I honestly can’t believe that these two people are the same person. Not necessarily in appearance, but in the outlooks on life and the world in general. At age eighteen… My state in life when the first picture was taken was one where I was as ready as ever to get into real estate (I’d just finished my licensing exams when I was 17), and my mission in life was to make as much money as possible. My goals included trading in real estate both as an agent and an investor, buying expensive clothes just for the bragging rights, getting my hands on the most badass Cadillac Escalade, and living in a sprawling mansion somewhere in Rancho Santa Fe. Gordon Gekko was my role model, I’d never been outside of Canada and the US (and had no interest in going elsewhere), and having just gotten out of a relationship a few months earlier, had no belief in love and convinced myself that I’d be a regular sugar daddy to the “inevitable” swarm of women who would come to me as a rich guy. Kind of contrary to this, I lived a highly frugal life, trying to keep money together for the sake of “building a foundation” that I could become wealthy off of. I was conditioned to earning about 9.00 CAD per hour working in a call centre for most of ages 16 and 17. So I’d do crazy things to hoard money. Making coffee at home instead of buying it on my way to work. Not eating lunch. Having an extremely basic cell phone plan. My logic was “I’ll save for today so I can put it to the best use to be enjoyed in the future.” The biggest change in my thinking was my realization that “the future” is bullshit. It may or may not exist. But regardless, why am I sacrificing myself today to possibly enjoy myself later on? You only live once - and if you’re going to be making yourself miserable on purpose because you think that’s going to make you enjoy yourself some years from now, you’re not living. You’re giving up a good today to possibly have a good tomorrow. As soon as I realized that it’s fully within my capability to enjoy myself today, and sustainably keep that enjoyment going indefinitely, that is when I began to enjoy life. I’d buy coffee, I’d go out for lunch, I’d get my hair cut every 10 days because it makes me feel good, I’d travel places I couldn’t actually afford to because I want to see more of the world. Every day I live is a page in my story. Do I really want whole chapters of my story to be miserable because “I was hoping it would get better later”? Give me a break! In the five years that elapsed from the time that first photo was taken, a ridiculous amount of things changed. In summary, those include… Getting into and out of real estate, realizing I’d put far too much stock into embracing a line of work I actually knew very little about, and that the constant stress, perpetual involvement in deals, and the amount of liability that rests on my shoulders just isn’t a way for me to live my life.Meeting my first true love on Saturday, November 26th, 2011. We didn’t work out, but the magnitude of emotions I only knew how to feel because of her made me see everything differently. Up until that point, I didn’t believe in love. But because of her, love existed to me. Love made sense. Love was something I could feel and enjoy. And because of that, I knew that love was one of my goals. If I had to, I would have given up literally every single thing in my life for her - and I’d never felt that strong of a feeling before. Suddenly the wisdom of “love is more important than money” didn’t sound so hokey to me.Going back to school, despite leaving high school when I was 16. I went to college as a mature student, and then to university in the UK to finish off a BA. This exposed me to a lot of things and a lot of people, and got me into my first “real job”.Finding my desire for travel. At the time the second picture was taken, I’d been to 14 different countries and flown over 100,000 km. Much of this was inspired by living in Italy for a summer while I was in school, and then in England for my final year. That year consisted of many trips to many places that opened my eyes and grew my hunger to explore.Speaking of that “real job”, I got a sense of what traditional adult-ing is. For so many grads, the 9–5 job with salary, benefits, a desk, and your inner circle at the office is an absolute dream. For me, it was a nightmare. Waking up early, rush hour, office politics, and highly mundane work made me feel like nothing more than a resource with an employee number. Now, don’t get me wrong. I absolutely fancied getting over 1,200 after taxes deposited into my bank account every two weeks, considering how I earned less than 250 per week after taxes in my call centre job (just over a third of my “real job” income). But all it really was is selling part of my life for money. That is, I’ve got 168 hours in a week. I’ll take 40 of them and decide to sell them to my employer every week in exchange for x amount of dollars. It just made me wonder, “is this it?”. Is this what adults do with their lives? Sign away 40 hours per week plus your long-term freedom in exchange for x amount of dollars? What kind of life is that to live, whether you earn 1,200 every two weeks or 10,000 every two weeks? No matter how much you bring home at the end of the day, you’re a resource at worst, and a slave at best.I’d quit that job shortly before the second picture was taken. My outlook on life was very different, with the mentality that there’s so much more to be done with life than just working hard and getting paid.Above all, something that changed me was realizing what it’s like to make a LOT of money. I won’t say exactly what things I was doing, but I had gotten into a few ventures that ended up paying exceptionally well for me (multiples more than what a 20-something would typically be earning). By my money-hungry standards, I’d made it. But something was missing. No matter how many fancy garments I owned, or how much steak I ate, I just felt as though I wasn’t fully enjoying myself. Was I buying those clothes because I liked them? Was I eating steak because it’s my favourite thing? Or was I doing those things because it made me feel rich and superior? I lied to myself and tried to persuade myself that “only these brands will do”, and “of course steak is my favourite food”. But deep down, I knew the truth. There’s so much more to what life has to offer than the most expensive and the most glamorous. It all comes down to what makes you truly happy. My definition of this will never truly be “final”. But being able to afford literally anything I wanted taught me that money was not my ceiling of fulfillment. It’s something much deeper, much less finite, and much more qualitative. At age twenty three… At this point, the only extent to which I cared about money was one where it could sustain me and make me happy. What I was really after was along the lines of travel, experiences, general happiness, and a circle of friends to enjoy things with. That is where being interesting, nice, personable, and sociable comes into play. There’s a fixed amount of money in the world. But an unlimited amount of happiness. The only issue is that most happiness is hidden and invisible to people. I’m glad that I know how to see it now, and that I realize the importance so that I can be happy today, and continue to be happy in the future - if that time ever does come. As for what I’m doing now (which is basically the same thing as when the picture was taken, as I just turned 24 two weeks ago), I’m doing freelance work that does not compromise my freedoms and my ability to be happy. I’ll sleep in most days, go out for coffee most mornings with a notebook to just think, and either indulge in, or think of ways to indulge in various forms of happiness - whether myself, or with friends. I’m confident that I’m in a place now where I’d be just as happy with 0 in the bank, as I would be with 10 MM in the bank. That took a great many experiences to realize. But I’m glad that I can constantly feel as though I’m at my 100%, and not at the mercy of the force of greed that weighed me down for so long. With the mentality shift from “I don’t have what I need yet” to “I have everything I need and anything else is a bonus”, I think that the change in facial expressions explains itself. Back then, I felt empty, and it showed. But now, I’m as full as can be, and only getting fuller."},{"instruction":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey?

First of all, you would most likely notice the brake failure pretty quickly while backing out of the parking spot or driveway or at least before you get to a significant speed. Depending on the car, you will likely get a brake warning light on the dash too. I noticed that the brakes weren’t working a few feet after backing out of the parking spot at the apartment complex that this happened at and simply used the E brake to stop and pulled back into the parking spot. But let’s say somehow you didn’t notice that the brakes weren’t working until you are up to highway speeds. Definitely a scary situation, but remember that you still have the E brake and engine to stop you. Downshifting to the lowest gear you can without exceeding redline and continuing to downshift as you slow down while simultaneously using the E brake will actually typically stop a car at a decently short amount of time. Just remember to apply the E brake carefully and gradually because applying it too quickly and aggressively will lock up the rear wheels, possibly causing you to lose control. If the wheels lock up, hold the steering wheel straight and release the E brake a bit until the wheels are rolling again. The idea is to use the E brake as hard as possible without locking up the tires. Electronic parking brakes will often do this automatically, but manual parking/emergency brakes can lock the tires up if applied too hard. It’s actually a good idea to carefully practice engine braking and using the E brake to stop without using the brakes in a safe place (not a busy road) before you end up in a situation where you lose your brakes and have to quickly try to figure this out right then and there. Knowing how to downshift and about how hard you can apply the E brake without locking the tires up could save you and other drivers from serious injury and a lot of damage if your brakes ever fail. Just don’t use the E brake for more than about 5 seconds at a time while practicing because it can overheat and suffer damage if it’s overused."},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"There are few good options like Tata Punch and Mahindra XUV 300 are available in the market under 10 lakhs.

Here are ten common investment options to consider, but it's important to conduct thorough research and possibly consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions: Stock Market:[LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #UgpJr] Investing in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allows you to own a share of a company. Stocks have the potential for high returns, but they also carry higher risks.Bonds: Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations. They generally offer lower returns compared to stocks but are considered more stable. They are often used to diversify a portfolio and provide income.Mutual Funds: Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. They offer diversification without requiring extensive research on individual assets.Real Estate: Investing in real estate involves buying properties to generate rental income or capital appreciation. Real estate can provide steady income and potential tax benefits.Index Funds: These funds track a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. They offer broad market exposure and tend to have lower fees compared to actively managed funds.Retirement Accounts[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #tzQjt]: Contributing to retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs can provide tax advantages and help secure your financial future.Dividend Stocks: These are stocks that pay regular dividends to shareholders. They can provide a source of passive income while still benefiting from potential capital appreciation.Peer-to-Peer Lending: This involves lending money to individuals or businesses through online platforms. It can offer higher returns than traditional savings accounts but carries higher risk.Cryptocurrencies: Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained popularity as speculative investments. However, they are highly volatile and should be approached with caution.Commodities: Investing in commodities like gold, oil, or agricultural products can provide a hedge against inflation and diversify your portfolio. Remember, diversification is key to managing risk. It's wise to spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate the impact of any single investment's poor performance. Additionally, your investment choices should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor an investment strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

The soldier is the highest level. The very bottom of the pile, below even a unskilled labourer and begger is the gambler and then there is the trader. If they died there would be no change seen in the world. Their life means nothing. Market makers and money managers are up with the architects of society, but they ain’t traders.

This is somewhat simplified, but for the most part the moderates are much more willing to compromise and reach across the aisle (often agreeing to more spending that way), while conservatives are anxious about the deficit and try to cut federal funding. Moderates tend to make up the idea of the “establishment” (again, tend to - I’ll get to the glaring exception later), while conservatives are the firebrands going against the establishment. In the 1950s, conservative Republicans blew their stack when President Eisenhower (a moderate Republican) failed to balance the budget. Fiscal responsibility was a backbone to what Sen. Barry Goldwater stood for when he ran for president in 1964, lambasting the growing size of the federal government and federal economy under President Johnson - but Goldwater lost in a landslide. Nixon was a moderate, which is why his government was willing to spend more money on things such as environmental measures, but Reagan was a conservative (recall his famous speech in favor of Goldwater that launched his political career) and cut funding to many government programs. H.W. Bush was moderate, but tried to paint himself as conservative, ending with some wishy-washy “read-my-lips” fiscal stuff. In the 1990s, part of why the Republicans were able to take Congress for the first time in decades was an effort spearheaded by conservative Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich to paint President Clinton as someone who didn’t care about balancing the federal budget or ending the deficit. However, his union with the 1996 Republican Party standard bearer, Sen. Bob Dole, was always flimsy at best - Gingrich was a conservative, Dole was moderate. Perhaps if Gingrich had answered the calls to run for office, did so in 1996, and somehow beat Clinton, a hypothetical Gingrich administration would have made fiscal policy a big part of its to-do list. Either way, Dole lost. George W. Bush was a moderate, so, like Nixon, his administration did spend a lot of money - especially on the Iraq War and the military. It was the 2010, 2012, and 2014 midterm elections during Obama’s presidency where things really got interesting. Tea Party candidates were definitely more conservative than moderate and seemingly more concerned about the deficit than anyone. Think of Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Mike Lee, Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Mark Meadows, and many others. However, though some Tea Party candidates ran in 2016, a fiscal moderate won the Republican nomination. Yes, despite all of the rhetoric, and his anti-establishment credentials, Donald Trump is technically a moderate Republican, and his administration reflects this by spending billions on the military, global initiatives (like the ones in favor of decriminalizing homosexuality and promoting female leadership). This spending has been reflected in a big, fat, Obama-style price tag. So, TL;DR, at least since WWII, moderate Republicans (Eisenhower, Nixon, Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Trump) are less afraid to spend federal money than conservative Republicans (Goldwater, Reagan, Gingrich, Paul, Lee, Cruz) - but you’ll notice that the moderate Republicans tend to be the ones who run for/win the highest office in the land."},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"MASTURBATION : A DEEP INSIGHT TO THIS NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY. IMPORTANCE OF CELIBACY. Hello Everyone , Today I want to tell you about The Vice of Masturbation and the Importance of Celibacy. Brahmacharya lifestyle has become a necessity of today's generation because It is digging own grave by falling prey to lust. Masturbation has become a demon who is constantly consuming the time and energy of Today's Youth. I have done an extensive research on this topic. Therefore I can answer this question. But before knowing about Brahmacharya , let us begin with some knowledge Masturbation. We all are humans . We all have to obey the laws of nature . Kindly understand that Sex and Masturbation are two different activities. Their is a lot of difference between them. Sex is a natural activity while Masturbation is unnatural activity ( That is the reason you feel ashamed of yourself after masturbating) Nature has created each organ of our body with a specific purpose. The purpose of Penis is to be involved in coitus with a female in order to sustain life further through the process of Reproduction. The disastrous effects of Masturbation : Weak bones , Pains all over the body and loss of confidence and concentration.Weak eyesight. Inferiority complex and lack of will to enjoy life.Anxiety issues and depression. Excessive Sleeping habits develop as you start remaining tired.Back pain and leg pain become extremely common.Digestive system becomes weak and slowly your whole body becomes weak . You will have no Desire to work or study and life will start becoming a burden on you.Frequent nightfall will be a common phenomenon.Believe me , The more you Masturbate the more your lust will increase. You will be struck in this vicious circle and find no way out of coming through it. This will only lead to frustration and irritation.There are many more disastrous effects of Masturbation .Mentioning all of them isn't possible. Why this happens ? Kindly know About The Seminal energy Semen is the most precious element in our body .It takes 30 to 35 days for the formation of sperms .According to ayurveda It is the last dhatu formed from the food cycle . It is formed in the following way: Rasa~> Rakt~> Manss~> Medh ~>Asthi~> Majja~> Shukra (Semen) Hence It can be vividly deduced that how important is semen. That is why if it's wasted by the disastrous activity of Masturbation , the above mentioned results will be seen. Not Only this , the Knowledgeable sages have even warned against excessive sex. Leave aside Masturbation as it is extremely awful activity. Semen Retention or Brahmacharya : Lord Mahavira , the 24th Jain Tirthankar included Celibacy or Brahmacharya as the 5th Mahavrat in Jainism. The other four being Satya , Asteya , Ahinsa and Aparigraha. Kindly understand that Buddha and Mahavira were Enlightened People . This clearly indicates the importance of Celibacy in life. In our success , brahmacharya plays an important role . The seminal energy we save through celibacy is diverted towards our brain to become OJAS, the divine energy Which can even activate the 7 chakras if practised for 12 years. Persistent celibacy helps us to achieve our goals easily. Celibacy helps in the holistic development of Human beings. However, it is not possible for commoner to do this. So, one shall try to follow as much celibacy as possible. Today's Modern world in which we are living is full of materialistic things and we easily loose our focus and become easy prey to lust . The best solution for this is to follow as such Celibacy as possible. This is specifically extremely beneficial for Students and teenagers who are generally suffering from Hormonal disbalance. It will help them to focus on studies and their goals. Celibacy keeps the person happy, healthy ,boosts his intelligence and provides him divine wisdom. One remains calm and mirthful. And encounters all the trials and tribulations of life easily. How long to follow Celibacy to see a change ? After following 30 days of celibacy, Not much will change . But you will see a change in your concentration and excitement levels . You will become happier and relaxed. Real change will be observed after 6 months .This has also been my personal experience As I have practiced celibacy for 8 months and observed many positive changes such as increase in wisdom thought intellect and confidence. When you begin , Celibacy will be tough to maintain , however once you follow celibacy for 2 months it becomes easier further. Celibacy has the potential to change your lives both materially and spiritually.Although we all know that how we feel guilty after masturbation and how we become lethargic. Because we have wasted our super seminal energy. Hence one shall try to maintain and follow Brahmacharya lifestyle . Advantages of Celibacy : Increased concentration , boost in physical and mental health.Increase in valour and charm of the face , evergreen youth and glittering eyes.A boost in will power and you will be able to give your 100% to achieve your goal.Memory Power will increase. For students preparing for exams such has UPSC , you already know how important is memory.Peace of mind and happiness . Cheerful mood all the time . No excessive worry of future. No Anxiety issues.Improved digestive system and holistic development of health and mind.Rise in intellectual abilities. You will be able to understand nature and life deeply.The list is very long. So kindly spare me to add more. Nightfall: Nightfall happens during our Sleep due to dreams full of lust and sexual unions. It is nothing but the side effects of masturbation. Remember when you had your first Nightfall ! You must have masturbated some time back or day back before that ! May be it was your first mistake while discovering about Sex after Puberty. But Remember that Man is the one who learns from his mistakes done in the past. Start following Celibacy and Nightfall will stop by its own. Science vs Experience : I know Some people will consider this Article thrash as they haven't seen any side effects of Masturbation in their own body and Probably have a Scientific approach to life.Let me tell you that I am from Science Background . But please don't fall prey to those doctors who say Masturbation is perfectly healthy activity and Semen Retention will cause Prostrate cancer ! They don't even know what they are saying. Remember that Science works on experiment What will you do if after 10 years Scientists and Doctors start claiming that Masturbation is dangerous activity ? Then will you start crying? Ask any older family members about Masturbation ( Don't Shy away ) They will always advise you to never waste Seminal energy. Just Think that one drop of Semen Consists of millions of Sperm. Each Sperm is capable of giving birth to a new life. Swami Vivekananda , Dayanand Saraswati , Bhagat Singh , Paramhansa , Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak , Subhas Chandra Bose and all the noble souls were born from a single Sperm that had successfully fertilised the egg cell. You are sensible enough to Realise the importance of Seminal energy. Reason for Failure of Science to Gather Clear Proof : Their is a reason for this. Every body is built differently , Some have low body immunity and Some are naturally strong. It is possible that someone Masturbates frequently and doesn't experience too many side effects but in his heart of hearts he knows what he has lost ! While their are many people who have clearly mentioned that they have experienced the above mentioned effects of Masturbation and how this activity has Destroyed their life . I challenge everyone to follow Celibacy for 1 month and observe the changes in your physical and mental abilities. You will never regret it. Additional Information : You can start watching Manthan Hub YouTube channel to know deeply about Celibacy and the disastrous effects of Masturbation.( The channel has mentioned Scientific approach and experimental proof of Celibacy )Read Books about Brahmacharya . They are easily available on Internet. They are extremely good and provide deep insight about Celibacy.Getting up early in the morning and Practicing Meditation will help you in Following Celibacy. How to start doing Brahmacharya : Get up early morning before SunriseEat a balanced diet of sattvik foodEat less spicy food and Don't eat late at nightExercise daily.Drink water often.Keep yourself busy and involved.Do meditation.Focus on your Goal. I hope my penmanship has helped you in understanding the greatness of Celibacy . Talking about Celibacy in such brief way is impossible as it is a vast subject. You can message me if you need any help. THANKYOU.

However, to stand out to employers, they should be unique in their own way. Here are certain basic points you can use as a reference while drafting the best IIT resume. 1. Categorization A best IIT resume must have key qualifications and competencies categorized well into sections. Headlines may be like academic qualifications, scholastic achievements, internship and research projects, technical skills, work experience, extracurricular etc. Do not overload your resume by accommodating more information. Know that simple things gain more attention. So, format your resume accordingly. 2. Length of a resume It is okay if your resume is somewhat lengthy. Keeping things simple has nothing to do with having a 3-page resume. Just make sure that you do not describe a particular topic too much. If you have more experience working as an IITian or many essential skills that you cannot skip, then it is better to mention those points. The ideal number of pages of a resume should not exceed 2 pages but again, it varies from individual to individual. 3. Strategy to hide weak areas It is quite acceptable that you may have certain weak points in your resume. Disguising them is your task. You must present your resume in such a manner that only highlights your expertise and draws less attention to your weak spaces. Let's say, you have a poor GPA in a particular educational qualification, you can leave that part and instead display your activities, papers, awards etc. Alternatively, you can talk about your major GPA that may get the interviewer to overlook other minor GPAs. 4. Use some colours Using some colours like green or blue to get the headlines noticeable is one criterion of a good resume. This same rule also applies to IITians. Since there may be a lot of qualifications, achievements and awards, it becomes necessary to look out for ways that can grab attention. Using colours and different fonts will certainly make the resume appealing. However, do not use too many colours as you don't want to create a rainbow out of a resume. Other than white for the background, the secondary colour should be black and for emphasis, you can use blue or green. Also, use bold fonts where needed. Italics are also fine to break away from the monotonous font that is generally used. 5. Other interests You may choose to add to the \\"Other interests\\" section of your resume where you will be highlighting your hobbies or other recreational activities. Although it is a norm to include this section at the end of the resume, it is not the least that you can mention. This part helps connect with your recruiter on a personal level. Besides, your hobbies will be highly regarded if they coincide with promoting awareness and welfare like recycling items or working for animal rights etc. Apart from analytical traits, you can also show your creative abilities like painting, story writing etc through the \\"other interests\\" section. I hope this answer helps you in drafting the best resume as an IITian. Keep your fingers crossed as your interviewer might hire you based on the fact that your resume crafting skills are extraordinary."},{"instruction":"w often is a calculator used in pure math?","output":"I will turn to a Python interpreter or Wolfram Alpha before I turn to a calculator."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"Start a money-making blog in 4 steps If you have basic writing skills, a topic you love and the ability to work for a time without seeing any reward, blogging might be a good way to make money.

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have seen significant price appreciation since their creation, and have the potential to provide a hedge against inflation because their supply is limited. However, cryptocurrencies are also highly speculative and volatile investments, with prices that can fluctuate rapidly.

Additionally, it's a good idea to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market and to seek the advice of a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. They can provide guidance on whether investing in cryptocurrencies is appropriate for you and help you develop a well-diversified investment strategy."},{"instruction":"Why does it seem so many foreigners, particularly those of Asian decent, own nail salons?

Do you think it makes a big difference if you get Coke or Pepsi?","output":"In the UK it is because there is a criminal offence called “Passing off”, a type of fraud. It means that a customer asks for one thing, and you “pass something off” as that item when it is not. At the top end of the range it could be a cheap fake instead of a Gucci handbag. In pubs, restaurants etc it is normally soft drinks that are the risky areas as people will always ask for their favourite brand, ie Coke or Pepsi. If the waitress gave you Pepsi when you asked for Coke and you worked for Trading Standards (the people who check these sort of things) you could be liable to a fine for it, unless the person is told it is Pepsi and asked if that is ok. If you went to KFC and asked for a chicken burger meal, would you want to be given a McDonalds chicken burger meal instead?"},{"instruction":"Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu Kurdish?","output":"Yes he is , although he is an assimilated Kurd ."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"No, food cooked in a microwave oven is not necessarily bad for your health. Microwaving is a safe and efficient way to cook food, and the microwave radiation used in cooking does not make food radioactive or cause any long-term harm to human health. However, it is important to note that microwaving food can cause some changes in the food's nutritional value. For example, some nutrients such as vitamin C may break down when exposed to high temperatures, including those in a microwave. Additionally, microwaving food in plastic containers that are not microwave-safe can cause harmful chemicals to leach into the food. To ensure that food cooked in a microwave oven is safe and healthy, it is recommended to use microwave-safe containers, avoid heating food in plastic containers unless they are specifically designed for microwave use, and stir or rotate food while cooking to ensure even heating. Additionally, it is important to follow cooking instructions carefully and use a food thermometer to ensure that food is cooked to a safe temperature.

Price volatility, trade volume, technical indicators, and fundamental analysis are a few examples of such variables. Use a Stock Screener: Make use of a stock screener to filter stocks according to your selected criteria. The relative strength index (RSI), moving averages, or any other indicators relevant to your strategy. Set Filters for Swing Trading: When setting filters for swing trading, think about looking for equities with short-term price momentum and swing potential. Look for stocks that are approaching important support or resistance levels, have a history of price volatility, or all three. Set Filters for Positional Trading: When setting filters for positional trading, concentrate on identifying equities that have the potential for long-term trends and sustained price movement. Take into account criteria such as firms with solid fundamentals, increasing earnings, and technical indicators pointing to a longer-term bullish trend.

I even rejected promotions and company bonuses (sports car included!) because I wanted to keep coding, not to become a team leader or something else where you only see code with the telescope. I have worked for a subsidiary of Lockeed Martin for years and maintained several very large C / C++ enterprise applications of theirs. As of today, I develop 95% in PHP and feel “real enough” that I earn tangible money and my backends power enterprise AngularJS / Vue websites. Actually, since PHP 7 came out, it’s like a “PHP come back” and popular, complex and very respected (even by the “purists”) frameworks like Laravel keep improving and being updated."},{"instruction":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","output":"If you have the skills and industry contacts, by all means, repair the rental property yourself.

But I can tell you that approved drawings were needed anywhere I supervised the building of swimming pools both commercial and residential. Pool inspections were rigorous and there were many ways to fail one. Be careful on steps into the poole and pay particular attention to fencing and gate requirements. Every phase and stage of the construction and initial filling of the pool is inspected and all equipment will be inspected to make certain it complies with the approved drawings."},{"instruction":"w can I download magazines for free on the Internet?","output":"There are several reputable websites where you can find free books in various digital formats.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"According to the statistics, yes. Private schools are better than public schools in every regard except cost. People believe this because private schools provide better education than public schools, but they also provide social gatherings, club activities, and other social events that the students never get at their school. Public schools would do well to take some lessons from the private schools. Private schools in Malaysia come with a certain level of prestige and a few benefits your child will appreciate, but don't expect the luxuries of a 5-star hotel. A huge part of going to a private school is going to class. Compulsory school uniforms, strict rules regarding hair color, and strict attendance policies are common in private schools. Wealthier families will often pay for after-school activities such as sports or music lessons. Many schools have special contracts with local physicians and hospitals, which provides the convenience of ready access to specialists without paying costly medical bills. Private schools also organize a significant number of cultural events throughout. A private school education in K.L. will cost you a minimum of RM3,500 per month, while a public school education costs way less. But how much better is a private school? The general consensus is that it's worth paying extra for smaller class sizes and teachers who can spend more time with their students. How much value does an education add to your child's future earning potential, plus the perks of networking and international exposure? Private schools have always been associated with having better facilities, better teachers and higher academic standards than public schools. This is true since private schools usually employ highly trained and experienced teachers and often provide access to better facilities and accommodations."},{"instruction":"What are some recommended laptops for college?","output":"A cheap workhorse. Its going to get lugged around and likely to be in not the most secure places. And any half decent modern laptop will do the job. So I recommend buying a refurbished ex corporate ThinkPad. Cheap as chips, competent, rugged. They aren't pretty but who cares? It's a tool to get you through college. Buy a pretty one when you land a good job. My previous was a refurb ThinkPad x250. Cost only £250 and lasted for three years and then only because it's EOL and our security controls don't let me use it any more. It would still make a fine college laptop. Shit.

Whether it is publicly or privately owned it is there for the purpose of supplying water to Fire Fighting crews. You cannot block it. Period. It is a matter of Public Safety . Just pay the ticket and do not park there again. Also..the color of the Hydrant generally indicates the flow rate of the Hydrant to the Fire Crew.

However on a person by person basis Bangladesh is not far behind:- Pakistan GDP PPP: 1,060,569. Bangladesh GDP: 686,598. Pakistan GDP PPP Per Capita: 5,354. Bangladesh GDP PPP Per Capita: 4,207. But if you talk about other factors, I’d say yes. Put it this way, I have been to Bangladesh. More than once. But you couldn’t pay me 15.6 million PKR to live/work in Pakistan. But then maybe I am biased. I might well be a Caucasian Westerner but I have just been luckier and happier (in general) when meeting and dealing with Bengalis than with Pakistanis."},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"Once A Shepherd Girl, Became France's Education Minister Everybody dreams of making it big in life but very few determined souls really act upon it. The story of Najat Vallaud-Belkacem is a testament to this, who overcame all the obstacles life laid at her feet and carved her own destiny. Once a shepherd girl of four — who fetched water from the well — Najat moved to France with her family and faced the real world full of opportunities as well as struggles. The Moroccan girl who had no proficiency in French learnt the language by the end of her first year in college. Reported by The Guardian, while describing the cultural change in her life, Najat said: \\"The fact of leaving one’s country, one’s family, one’s root can be painful, my father had already found his place, but for us, for my mother, it was very difficult to get our bearings.\\" Najat inherited hard work and resourcefulness from her father who laid strict rules for his daughters - no boys and no nightclubs till the age of 18. As a result, the girls completely surrendered themselves to studies. Najat's sister, Fatiha, is a lawyer in Paris. While studying at the University of Amiens, Najat got the opportunity to pursue higher education with the prestigious Institut d’études politiques de (also known as Sciences Po). This set her on the path winding the political landscape in France. Najat worked two jobs to take the financial load off her parents while pursuing her Master's in Public Administration. It is during this time she met Boris Vallaud, a fellow student, and the two married in 2005. Najat's political career began with her joining the Socialist Party as an adviser to the mayor of Lyon. She later ran for elections and won the seat of the Councillor. In 2012, she was appointed as the Minister of Women’s Affairs by François Hollande, the then Socialist president. In 2014, she served as the Minister of Women’s Right, Minister of City Affairs, Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports. In a major cabinet shuffle, she was promoted to serve as the Minister of Education. While advising the youth who want to participate in the country's politics, Najat said, \\"I have always advised the youths to get involved in politics. The best way to be happy with your future is by playing a part in it. If you’re just a spectator of collective fate, you’re bound to feel frustrated.\\" Thanks for reading✨"},{"instruction":"As a Buddhist, how can I increase my level of compassion without being taken advantage of?","output":"Have you ever held an infant who cried, threw up on you, or poked your face hard enough to cause you pain? Did you get mad and slap him or her in rage? Or did you understand that they were acting out of ignorance, and try to address their pain? I hope the latter. Yes, you may have held that infant a little farther away from your face to avoid getting poked again, that’s just intelligent. You might have even deliberately caused them some discomfort to help condition them in a healthy way. (I understand that some American Indians would gently twist their babies’ nose to teach them not to cry.) But you don’t consider that infant to be horrible because they don’t have the wisdom to understand what’s going on. It may be helpful to remember that people are just infants who grew older and taller."},{"instruction":"What is the practical value of the bottom number in a time signature?

I am sure that they sell it in the U.S., or do they put some sugar loaded strawberry jam on their toast? But it doesn't seen common abroad. British style chocolate, allegedly better but not exported widely. British beer is so awful that it's not commonly exported except to where there's a large ex-pat community. Farmhouse scrumpy. Like cider except opaque. Blue/Green cheeses. Cheese with actual controlled mould in it. Our Chinese food is more chinglish than truly Chinese. Likewise our Indian food commonly has meat. Doner kebab. How is this not worldwide? What do you eat after a hard night drinking session? Chips. Totally different from fries. Preferably with plenty of salt and vinegar. If we have ketchup it goes on the side of the plate so we can dip our chips in it. We can replace ketchup with brown sauce in the UK. Worcestershire sauce is something totally different, and you must not use it in embalming fluid."},{"instruction":"What do clients look for in a financial advisor?","output":"Sincerity."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy in a real crisis?","output":"If we talk about fiscal front NDA government has succeeded in reducing the financial losses since last many years. It is hoped that this discipline will attract investors. International bodies also hoped that investment in India will increase , but our experience of last six years showed us that it rather decreased. In such situation many are demanding that the government should try to raise revenue by solving out the tax conflicts and giving them the charm of converting black money into white. But this step is just a band-aid in a situation that demands a surgery. Oil prices can go up due to America-Iran conflict. Our export will also get effected. Earth’s rising temperature has begun to show its effects in our country also in the form of disasters. In the absence of sufficient employment, people will protest more vigorously on Citizenship Ammendment Act or CAA. Reserve Bank is helpless. Tax deduction is neutral. One way to increase the demand is that government should raise its capital expenditure by giving up the ways to control economic losses. But we'll have to see that what would be the effect of these investments on a common man. Some investments are harmless. Improving the village roads is also an investment in basic infrastructure and it has positive effects on a common man. One more example is national waterways. Transport of coal and other things from Haldia to Varanasi via waterways can lead to savings but it will ruin the metier of small sailors and fishermen. Purchasing power of common man will drop. Instead, if we promote the transportation through small boats , it will still be an investment in basic infrastructure but will lead to positive effects on the purchasing power of a common man. Nowadays , markets are seeing drop in demands as we are investing in infrastructure like highways, waterways and cutting down of forests due to which the income of a common man is decreasing. If the government keeps aside the worries of economic losses and invests in those infrastructures that will raise the purchasing power of a common man , economy will revive. In the 2nd quarter of current financial year there was an overall 7•8% increase in private consumption , which was less than 14•4% which it was during the last year. Government consumption is at its normal pace but the private consumption is decreasing. When roads are constructed in a village, demand of cement-steel increases. On the other hand by increasing the salaries of government officials, demands of cars etc increase but this doesn't has a comprehensive benefit. In order to get over the present crisis , government should freeze the salary allowances of its workers so that the burden on government's expenses is reduced. Government should also think about the privatization of public banks' and other beneficial units. Furthermore, government should heavily invest in the creation and spread of new technology like online education so that our youth can get employment in these rising sectors. The basic idea is that the government should think about increasing the income of a common man."},{"instruction":"What are the pros/cons of using alcohol vs. marijuana?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: 7 Days to Drink Less] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/sevendaystodrinkless/home] Anything in excess will always cause harm.

It is obviously sexist, but I cannot see racist undertones in it.","output":"There’s nothing remotely racist or sexist in the poem. Anyone who finds the closing line to be sexist is trying wayyyy too hard to be offended. I’ll be the first to take up the fight against genuine sexism, but projecting all gendered concepts through all of history as sexism is both aggravating and counterproductive to gender equality. The objection, I suspect, is to Kipling himself. Kipling was a white Brit born in the mid-19th century to colonial parents in India. He was a product of the culture of casual imperialism so inherent to British society at the time, and he undoubtedly had racial and imperialist views that would seem outdated to us today. That said, I’m not familiar of any evidence that he was particularly racist by the standards of his time. In fact, he seems to have had a genuine affection for India and its people, and recognized some of the troubling aspects of European imperialism. Point is, even denouncing Kipling as a racist shows a total disregard for context or social realities. That kind of cheap offense can be used against pretty much any historical figure from whom we have significant writings: almost without exception, one of them will have said something that comes across as offensive to modern ears. But to go beyond that and say that a poem that never alludes to any issues of race is inherently racist because it was written by a 19th century European is utterly ridiculous. People who do so strike me as people who are less interesting in actually solving problems than they are in making clear how angry they are about whatever they’ve decided to be angry about this week."},{"instruction":"false surrendering a war crime?

Back then, education was unheard of, only selected few had any “education” at all, and these were the priests and religious leaders. How then, to explain Creation, but to SIMPLIFY it down, so that the average person and the masses could comprehend. Each “day” of Creation could have been a billion years or more in human terms, but how can the masses understand this, so boil it down to a “Day\\", to simplify it. God did not wave a magic wand and in 6 Days created the world with all it's physical laws, for life to exist. Therefore He conceived of Evolution as the science so that the earth and it's elements evolved and physical laws took shape to make life possible on earth. Imagine, for example, if there are no Physical Laws such as Laws of Gravity, Laws of Motion, etc, how can life exist on earth. Put up a structure or have physical motion and leave it to chance ?? Therefore, Darwin's Theory of Evolution, supports that a Creator, a Greater Being, conceived, and created the world so human life can exist.

Not surprisingly, Rudra came to be closely associated with the god of death, Yama; with the god of fire, Agni; and with the magical drink, soma.

Rudra Rudra in Vedas 1.1. The earliest mentions of Rudra occur in the Rig Veda, where three entire hymns are devoted to him. It is said that there are as many as seventy-five references to Rudra in the Rig-Veda Samhita. Most of those occur in the First and the Second Books. [For details please see Notes below@] Rudra is a divinity of the mid-sphere 2.1. Rig Veda mentions a set of thirty-three deities. According to Yaska-charya, the thirty-three gods are divided equally in three different planes of existence namely the celestial plane ( dyuloka ) the intermediate region ( antariksha-loka ) and the terrestrial region ( bhur-loka ) each plane having eleven gods. There is however a slight variation among the different traditions in naming the thirty-three most eminent deities ( trayastrimsati koti ) . According to the Shatapatha Brahmana , these thirty-three deities include eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, Dyaus, and Prithvi. aṣṭau vasavaḥ | ekādaśa rudrā dvādaśā-adityā ime eva dyāvā-pṛthivī trayastriṃśyau trayastriṃśadvai devāḥ – Sp.Br.4.5.7.2 While, Yaska-charya mentions: eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas and two Asvinis. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad the Rishi Yajnavalkya at one stage says “The eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, Indra and Prajapati are the thirty-three gods”. aṣṭau vasava ekādaśa rudrā dvādaś-ādityāḥ ta ekatriṃśad aindraś caiva prajāpatiś ca trayastriṃśāv iti || BrhUp_3,9.2 || 2.2.

Fat accumulation can be extremely stubborn and time-consuming to burn. Be it arms, legs or face, excess fat can make one appear unfit and make one unhappy with their appearance. Face fat is one of the most common concerns people often have. Face fat is also considered one of the most stubborn fats to burn. There are various misconceptions and spread of misinformation around how can face fat be reduced. In this article, we list the actual ways through which you can reduce your face fat. Do facial exercises Facial exercises can be used to improve facial appearance, combat aging, and improve muscle strength Anecdotal reports claim that adding facial exercises to your routine can also tone facial muscles, making your face look slimmer. Some of the most popular exercises involve puffing out your cheeks and pushing the air from side to side, puckering your lips on alternating sides, and holding a smile while clenching your teeth for several seconds at a time. Although evidence is limited, one review reported that facial exercises may build muscle tone in your face Another study showed that performing facial muscle exercises twice per day for 8 weeks increased muscle thickness and improved facial rejuvenation Keep in mind that research is lacking on the effectiveness of facial exercises for fat loss specifically. More studies are needed to evaluate how these exercises may affect facial fat in humans. Add cardio to your routine Often, extra fat in your face is the result of excess body fat. Losing weight can contribute to fat loss and help slim down your body and face. Cardio, or aerobic exercise, is any type of physical activity that increases your heart rate. It’s widely considered a highly effective method for weight loss. Multiple studies have found that cardio can help promote fat burning and increase fat loss What’s more, one study found that women with obesity experienced greater fat loss when they engaged in more cardio exercise Try to get 150–300 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each week, which translates to 20–40 minutes of cardio per day Some common examples of cardio exercise include running, dancing, walking, biking, and swimming. Drink more water Drinking water is crucial for your overall health and can be especially important if you’re looking to lose facial fat. Studies suggest that water can keep you feeling full and enhance weight loss. In fact, one small study found that drinking water before a meal significantly decreased the number of calories consumed during the meal Other research suggests that drinking water may temporarily increase your metabolism. Increasing the number of calories you burn over the course of the day can help boost weight loss Limit alcohol consumption Enjoying the occasional glass of wine with dinner is fine, but excessive alcohol intake can be one of the biggest contributors to fat accumulation and bloating. Alcohol contains mostly empty calories, meaning that it is high in calories but lacking in important nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals It also acts as a diuretic — a substance that increases the production of urine. This can lead to dehydration and water retention Some research also suggests that alcohol could influence levels of certain hormones that affect hunger and appetite. For example, it may reduce levels of leptin, a hormone that promotes feelings of fullness What’s more, studies show that heavy drinking could increase inflammation and may be associated with an increased risk of weight gain, increased belly fat, and obesity Keeping your alcohol consumption in check is the best way to avoid alcohol-induced bloating and weight gain. According to the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defined as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women Cut back on refined carbs Foods containing refined carbs, such as cookies, crackers, and pasta, are common culprits of weight gain and increased fat storage. These carbs have been heavily processed, which strips them of their beneficial nutrients and fiber and leaves little behind besides sugar and calories. Because they contain very little fiber, your body digests them rapidly. This leads to spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels and may make you more likely to overeat One study in 277 women showed that a higher intake of refined carbs was associated with a higher risk of obesity and greater amount of belly fat No studies have looked directly at refined carbs’ effects on facial fat. However, replacing refined carbs with whole grains may help increase overall weight loss, which may also aid facial fat loss Get enough sleep Catching up on sleep is an important overall weight loss strategy. It may also help you lose facial fat. Sleep deprivation can cause an increase in levels of the stress hormone cortisol. High cortisol levels come with a long list of potential side effects, including weight gain Studies have shown that high cortisol levels can increase appetite and alter metabolism, resulting in increased fat storage Furthermore, squeezing in more sleep may help you shed extra pounds. One study found that better sleep quality was associated with successful maintenance of weight loss Conversely, studies show that sleep deprivation can lead to increased food intake, weight gain, and decreased metabolism Ideally, aim for at least 8 hours of sleep per night to aid weight management and facial fat loss. Watch your sodium intake The main source of sodium in most people’s diets is table salt. You might add it to food from a shaker, but you may also consume it passively as part of processed or premade foods, sauces, and other everyday condiments. One trademark symptom of excess sodium intake is bloating, which may contribute to facial puffiness and swelling. That’s because sodium causes your body to hold on to extra water — this is called fluid retention Several studies have shown that a higher intake of sodium can increase fluid retention, especially in people who are more sensitive to the effects of salt Processed foods account for more than 75% of sodium intake in the average diet, so cutting out convenience foods, savory snacks, and processed meats can be an effective way to reduce your sodium intake [LINKED_TEXT: I lost 57 lbs weight just 5 weeksI lost 57 lbs weight just 5 weeks \\"I've never seen the weight come off like this.

Eat more fiber One of the most popular recommendations for slimming your face and losing cheek fat is to increase your intake of fiber. Fiber is a substance in plant foods that your body doesn’t absorb after you consume it. Instead, it moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling fuller for longer. In this way, it can help curb cravings and decrease appetite In one study in 345 people with overweight and obesity, higher fiber intake was associated with increased weight loss and helped people stick to a low calorie diet Another review of 62 studies suggested that eating more soluble fiber may reduce both body weight and waist circumference, even if you don’t restrict your calorie intake Soluble fiber is a type of fiber that forms a gel when mixed with water. One common type of soluble fiber in the diet is beta glucan, which is found in oatmeal, barley, and other cereals. Fiber is naturally found in a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes. Ideally, you should aim to consume at least 25–38 grams of fiber per day from these food sources Improve overall diet Diets high in processed foods, including refined carbohydrates, may increaseTrusted Source the risk of weight gain and obesity. Processed foods tend to contain more calories, salt, and sugar than whole foods. Refined carbohydrates are a group of highly processed, grain-based foods. During processing, these foods lose fiber and nutrients. As a result, they are high in empty calories. Refined carbohydrates can also cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, which may encourage a person to overeat. Examples of refined carbohydrate foods include: pastawhite ricewhite breadsucrosesyrups and frostingsmost breakfast cerealsreduced-fat products In most cases, people can find reasonable replacements for overly processed foods and refined carbohydrates. A person can decrease their caloric intake and increase the amount of nutrients they consume by eating fresh whole foods. When combined with exercise, a healthy, balanced diet may help people lose excess fat in the face and body. Frequently asked questions Here are some common questions about reducing facial fat. How can I lose face fat in a week? Reducing alcohol consumption, getting plenty of sleep, staying hydrated, and limiting salt intake are a few simple ways to reduce swelling and fluid retention, which may make the face appear slimmer. What foods make the face fat? There are no specific foods that can increase facial fat.

Want to tap into the potential of Affiliate Marketing, but not sure where to start? Well, listen up, because I'm about to drop some truth bombs that will set you on the path to success! 1. Knowledge is power: If you want to make serious money in Affiliate Marketing, you need to know your stuff. Don't be one of those half-knowledged amateurs trying to fool people with empty claims. Dive deep into your niche, learn the ins and outs, and become an expert. Providing value through well-informed product/service reviews is the key to winning the trust of your audience. 2. Follow your passion: One of the biggest advantages of Affiliate Marketing is that you can choose what you promote. Don't fall into the trap of picking a niche solely based on conversion rates. Instead, choose a niche that you genuinely enjoy and have a passion for. By aligning your interests with your marketing efforts, you'll not only create better content but also enjoy the journey towards success. 3. Keywords matter, but competition can crush you: Sure, targeting the best keywords in your niche might seem like the Holy Grail. But trust me, those keywords are often fiercely competitive. Instead of getting tangled up in the struggle, focus on finding keywords with lower competition but still high intent. To do this, explore new and upcoming products in your niche, rather than going head-to-head with established players. It's all about carving your niche in a smart and strategic way. 4. Choose your partners wisely: Not all brands are created equal. Before diving into a partnership, do your due diligence.

This has resulted in a decrease in profits for many of the smaller, regional carriers who can't compete with the larger airline's resources. Additionally, some of these smaller carriers feel that Emirates is taking away their customers by offering lower fares and more amenities than what they can provide. Ultimately, this has caused tension between the two groups as each tries to gain an edge over one another in order to remain profitable."},{"instruction":"What coins were in use in Italy in the 6th century A.D. and what was their value?","output":"I'm no expert on the Late Anitquity's numismatics but I know the Ostrogoths did mint their own coinage, and obviously Roman coinage would probably still be in wide circulation (especially in Byzantine controlled Exarchate of Ravenna), and certainly some Frankish coinage would be found closer to France.

And I really mean ALL KINDS of these things. I don't want to diminish anyone's problems with allergies, they can really be a pain, but I must say that I had a hard time believing that he was allergic to all these things. That's about 80% of all food there is… EDIT; I'm getting more and more people commenting that this might very well be possible. I admit defeat; he might have had all those allergies and I was just being ignorant. If you ever read this, E; I'm sorry! (To clarify; I'm pretty sure I saw him eat the things he was allergic to on some occasions. It could ofc be a mild allergy, but that's what mainly caused my suspicion to grow) If the person who asked the question wants this to be removed (as it's a bit ot) say the word and I'll delete it."},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter. Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"In the situation you described, it appears that you are being asked to resign from your position, which means you are technically quitting rather than being fired. Your manager expressed that they are unable to retain your position, and by asking for a resignation letter, they are requesting you to voluntarily step down from your role. In such cases, employers may ask for a resignation letter to document the employee's decision to leave the company voluntarily. This can have implications for things like final pay, benefits, and the terms of your departure. It's important to carefully consider your options before submitting a resignation letter. If you feel uncomfortable or uncertain about the situation, you may want to seek legal advice or speak with HR to understand your rights and the implications of resigning. Resigning voluntarily can have different implications than being terminated, so it's crucial to be informed and make a [LINKED_TEXT: decision that aligns with your best interests.] [URL: https://academiaxperts.in/]"},{"instruction":"Why is blue the most used color on the internet?","output":"Because blue is most people's favorite color, by a wide margin.

People like blue."},{"instruction":"it safe to give your dog toothpaste for bad breath?","output":"It can be safe to give your dog toothpaste for bad breath, but it's important to choose a toothpaste specifically formulated for dogs. Human toothpaste often contains ingredients that can be harmful to dogs, such as xylitol, which is toxic to them. Dog toothpaste usually has a more appealing flavor to dogs and is designed to be swallowed. Additionally, it's important to introduce tooth brushing to your dog gradually, as some dogs may not be comfortable with the process. Start with letting your dog sniff and lick the toothpaste before progressing to brushing their teeth. You can also use other dental products, such as dental chews or water additives, to help keep your dog's mouth healthy and fresh. However, if your dog has persistent bad breath, it could be a sign of dental problems or other health issues. It's recommended to take your dog to the vet for a checkup and professional dental cleaning if needed. Overall, while giving your dog toothpaste for bad breath can be safe and beneficial, proper care and attention to their dental health are crucial for their overall well-being.

That is: If the HOA actually exists (and some blowhard isn’t making up a story), then you’re in the HOA and subject to its rules and regulations. You can’t get out of it. Check with an attorney to determine what recourse, if any, against the title company. They’ve got insurance (errors and omissions insurance) to cover situations in which they screw up. But the question is showing what damages you have or will experience . . . and how much it’ll cost you to pursue that."},{"instruction":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","output":"This Brit thinks you have stepped back into the 18th century."},{"instruction":"Why did Dr B.R.

When they learn how difficult Huskies can be, the Husky is often abandoned."},{"instruction":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","output":"I voted for Donald Trump, a big mistake."},{"instruction":"Why do some gun control opponents feel that the second amendment guarantees the right to own any type of gun whatsoever?","output":"Because it does. Clearly and unmistakably it is expressed as the right to arms. The applicable limitation is to keep and bear. Do you possibly have a comprehension problem or is it fear induced disbelief? The founders were of the correct mind that the right to arms was to secure all rights. What do you suggest citizens use, pepper spray or baseball bats when the greatest danger will always come from government. You are wrong. It is the proponents of oppression, slavery and human suffering that demand citizens give up their right so such aberrants and rejects of society can do as they wish."},{"instruction":"What is jazz?","output":"Music theory alone does not define jazz nor any other style of music. This is an extremely hard question to define, and every single answer you will get can be easily countered or challenged by another opinion. This is even more true if you're asking just musicians to respond to the question. The one small thing that everybody could probably agree on is that improvisation is perhaps the most important part of the tradition of the music. Without improv, it is not jazz. Typically, any music being read from sheet music will not be extremely detailed in terms of notation and by definition leaves much open to interpretation by the performers. That interpretation may be guided with a lot, a little, or sparse chord changes/forms/instructions. To give you some further scope on how much this question is avoided and debatable by many artists, I can tell you that I have applied for grants with Chamber Music America who provide composition grants for both classical and jazz composers. I remember at one of the information sessions a composer asked how CMA defined jazz for the purposes of the grants, so that the composer knew whether to apply for the classical or jazz application given the crossover nature of his work. CMA told the artist that it was up to them to figure out the definition of their music and which one it belonged in. They refused to try to put a definition on what jazz is or is not!"},{"instruction":"What are easy recipes to learn if I don't know how to cook or even prepare basic dishes?","output":"I think understanding the purpose of cooking will help you learn how to cook.

Layer Experience The richer the internal layers (including touch, chewing, taste) and external layers (ingredient color, aroma), the better the dining experience. Since the extra layers only play a complementary role in the one-time dining experience, the decisive factor accounts for less than 2%, except for the emotional fluctuations that can affect the dining experience are not worth mentioning, and they play the premise is always in the tongue-based sensory experience of taste, so do not require too much. # Layer sense pattern Progressive, seemingly rhythmic fluctuations # Sensory enhancement experience Explode the juice, melting, outflow, jumping, Inflating, crunching, etc. # Linking Experience A linking experience of chewing and taste experience 1. Flavor comes out Flavor follow-through. For dishes that require chewing to stimulate the flavor of the ingredients themselves, the shorter the process from chewing to stimulating the original flavor of the ingredients, the better the follow-through, and the better the experience. 2. After-taste Taste retention. The longer it takes for the original flavor of the ingredients to disappear after chewing stops, the better taste retention and the better the experience. A linking experience of temperature and taste 1. Sensitivity enhancement The higher the temperature, the more likely it is to stimulate sensitivity to spicy flavors. The lower the temperature, the more likely it is to stimulate sensitivity to sweet flavors."},{"instruction":"What are your tricks and ways to make instant ramen noodles taste better and different?","output":"What are some things you can add to Ramen to make it taste better?

It sounds counterintuitive, right? Well, let me explain. Research has shown that when people use larger forks while eating, they tend to consume less food compared to those using smaller forks. It's like a magic trick for portion control! The reason behind this phenomenon is quite fascinating. Our brains rely on visual cues to determine how much we've eaten. When we see a smaller portion on a large fork, it appears more significant, tricking our brains into thinking we've had enough food. As a result, we feel satisfied with less. On the other hand, if we use a small fork and take smaller bites, it may not register the same way in our minds. We might perceive the smaller portions as insufficient, leading us to eat more to feel satisfied. So, if you're looking to manage your food intake or practice portion control, using a bigger fork might just do the trick. It's a simple yet mind-blowing way to hack your brain and potentially eat less without feeling deprived. Who would have thought that the size of our cutlery could impact our eating habits?"},{"instruction":"w do I unlock a SIM card on my son's phone?","output":"I had been facing a frustrating issue with the carrier lock on my phone for quite some time.

Have you ever thought about how do bats hunt during night times…..?? Here the answer….. Bats..we all know that bats will be active at night times rather than daytime's for their pray. This is because most of the insects and other birds can't escape in dark and they can't see clearly their surroundings..Bats also unable see clearly during night times but here the concept of echolocation and Doppler effect comes… Bats produces sound waves with high pitch and frequency that beyond the human rangee.These waves as echos travel in the air and hit and finnaly hits the target and returns to the source(bat) this principle is called echolocation. the echolocation sound has an extremely high pitch so high that it is beyond the human hearing range. But the sound behaves the same way as the sound of your shout. It travels through the air as a wave, and the energy of this wave bounces off any object it comes across. A bat emits a sound wave and listens carefully to the echoes that return to it. Image: Google source… A bat can tell how big an insect is based on the intensity of the echo. The­ bat can sense in which direction the insect is moving based on the pitch of the echo. If the insect is moving away from the bat, the returning echo will have a lower pitch than the original sound, while the echo from an insect moving toward the bat will have a higher pitch. This difference is due to the Doppler effect. Thanks for reading… Koushik: )"},{"instruction":"Why does this generation have a lot of depressed people?","output":"Hi!

One major reason not to would be that it might be booby trapped! We tend not to have pitched battles in modern warfare so it's not often you'd see a lot of enemy weapons on the ground. Mostly with hit and bugger off tactics the enemy takes their weapons with them when they have had enough of playing real soldiers as they might not have an abundance of firearms back at base. If you got to the point of needing the enemies weapons to carry on fighting something has gone very wrong and you'd have bigger issues to deal with than no weapon. Being able to use the enemies weapons also relies upon there being ammo for them as well. You can't take your NATO 5.56s and pop them in an AK!!"},{"instruction":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","output":"GATE is a very important milestone in your life.You just have to start preparation for GATE, As soon as possible.

How do you beat a slot machine with skill? You could weight your bets, but you would never come close to overcoming the preset odds. The only games of true skill are card games. But be forewarned, any skill beyond your organic brain is cheating in the eyes of the casino. If you experience consistent success, the casino takes notice of everything you do on 3,200 cameras in the casino. So you can count cards, with a friend, and a handy little computer strapped to your leg. It's been done, and caught. Card counters can make a modest income, for awhile, but remember, casinos have full time staff looking just for you. Eventually, you will get caught and blacklisted from every casino in Nevada and New Jersey with photographs and fingerprints to lock you out of casinos for life.Also, some casinos have card rooms. It's just a friendly game with random individuals who showed up in the card room, right? No, most of the card players you see in the card room are hired hands of the casino; their only job is to relieve you of your money and they are cooperating with one another to do it. Is there any way to win more than you lose at a casino? Yes. A very small percentage of people have done it and continue to do it for a living. It's sports betting. The house always has the advantage by 10% minimum on sports booking. But could you overcome that 10% with your tactical and strategic knowledge of a given sport? Yes, but you won't do it with mathematics. It's done with wisdom. Countless hotshots with Ph D' s galore have teamed up to build algorithms to beat the sports book, and they fail. The people who do win more than they lose do it through wisdom. It takes a special kind of brain to recognize when to wager and when to not. Over the long run, how do I win more than I lose? You never take a wager that is not in your favor. The sports book line is set based on the aggregate pool and the casino has to move the line to accommodate how much money is moving one way or another. The people who recognize a sports book line in their favor make a bet. If the line never moves to your favor, you just don't place a bet. There's no end to the number of MIT and Harvard hotshots who believe, surely with my superior mathematical knowledge, I can beat the house and the public. But they don't. For the very small number of gamblers who win more than they lose, which is less than 1% of the total, they do it through wisdom. Sure, good math is important, but math doesn't put you over the top. A few people have built algorithms to win more than they lose at horse racing. But in horse racing, you are not betting against the house. In horse racing, the house wins on every single bet, all of them. Because horse racing is pari-mutuel. The house gets a percentage of every single bet made. They don't care if you win every time, because they are winning everytime. In horse racing you are betting against the other betters, after the takeout percentage. There is a saying in horse racing: 98% of people consistently lose, 1% consistently break even, and one golden unbelievable percent turn a profit. To be in that 1% to turn a profit, it takes way more than mathematical and statistical knowledge. There was a very famous pair of guys who did it in Hong Kong in the 80's and 90's. But know this, every day guys go to work and punch a clock churning out the statistical data that horse players will use to evaluate their bets. If it were simply a matter of superior statistical ability, why are the guys who prepare the statistics still punching a clock? They could make a mint if they kept their statistics private, and hold an advantage over the public in numbers. Any successful algorithm must include wisdom to overcome the takeout rate. That's something the hotshot PhD's don't have. In common language it's horse knowledge. Las Vegas does not play games that do not make them a winner. All of their games are designed to relieve people of their money through greed, wanting to walk out with more than they walked in. If you somehow found a way to consistently beat the casino through skill at any of their games, you would stick out like nobody's business and they would be on to you very fast and shut you down for life. Of the people who turn a profit at sports betting, many are banned, but they make bets by proxy, hiring people to walk in and place bets in the casino on their behalf. That number is so small however, that the casino has no problem holding their preplanned statistical advantage in the game. If beating a casino consistently through mathematical skill was possible, there would be a continuous stream of Ph D bettors showing up a the casino to beat them. Simply put, it cannot be done according to the rules of math. In the rare circumstances where it can be done, sports betting, it's done through wisdom."},{"instruction":"What are the best GRE coaching centres in Delhi, especially for maths?","output":"Look, if Math is not your forte then I would say you need formal coaching for GRE since quant can be really hard without a clear idea of your math concepts.

It is quite popular in many parts of Nepal. In most Nepalese households, the day is usually started with few sips of tea and tasty bites of selroti.

It's quite popular during Chath festival. It's sweet in taste and truly mouthwatering. At last, I wanted to say that breakfast culture is still not a norm in many households.

Research shows us that the number one variable, other than poverty, is the education level of the student’s mother.

Injuries and general wear and tear on his left arm ended his career at the age of 30. 12 years just barely qualifies for HOF admission (10 year minimum). I’m guessing there was a lot of projecting going on in voters’ minds (“If he hadn’t gotten hurt, he’d have won at least 100 more games and had 1,000 more strikeouts”), but I know that, at the time, the perception of everyone, from the casual fan to the media to the players, was that Koufax was the greatest ever, based on those final 4 years.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","output":"I think Babasaheb hated Hinduism because at that time and even now to some extent what Hindus practice in the name of Hinduism is actually Brahmanism, I have some knowledge as my fiance is a Sanskrit Master Degree Holder and I get to know some information from her, she said that in the Vedas there are no mention of birth based caste, rather it was Varnashrama in which people had to go through Chaturashrama's Brahmacharyashrama which is actually meant schooling in which anyone and everyone could join and when the study ends you get your Varna according to your skill and work, the Varnas were Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishaya and Shudra, those who dealt with knowledge were given Brahman Varna, those who dealt with weapons were given Kshatriya Varna, those who dealt with economy were given Vaishya Varna anf those who failed to learn any skill were given Shudra Varna, Shudra meant labor, the first 3 Varnas were called Dwij means twice born and had to go through a Upanayan ceremony like Graduating Ceremony where they all were given Janeu to wear irrespective of the Gender, people were able to change their Varna within their life span for example, Ratnakar became Valmiki, prostitute's son Satyakam became Rishi Satyakam, then there are Apala, Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi like women philosophers, then there was different ways of worship debated, Hindu denominations have different conceptions of God, including henotheism, monotheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and sometimes atheism or non-theism are found in a minority of Hindu denominations. so its will be injustice to say Hinduism which is more than religion, a civilization, a Jivan Dhara, a way of life is inherently inequal, actually I find it more equal, liberal that civilization at that time in case of sexuality, women empowerment, now ManuSmriti is relatively new and written 300+ people started nearly 2200 years ago and it brought in Birth Based Caste instead of Skill and Work based Varnashrama, spread more idol worship thus strengthened the hold of so called Brahmans in the society, destroyed our unity, paved way for Islamic invasion, birth based caste system started 1900 years, [LINKED_TEXT: When Did Indians Start Dividing Themselves Into Castes?] [URL: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/08/20/origins_of_india_s_caste_system_genetic_research_suggests_the_country_s.html] and Aryan Invasion never happened [LINKED_TEXT: Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study - Times of India] [URL: http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms] so nearly 2000 years ago we were living in a mostly equal society but we are not following those ideals today, Birth based Caste system is a worst anomaly in our great civilization and Babasaheb knew that as Hinduism so it is natural for him to hate Hindusim, now we are wise and must finish off the social evils like Babasaheb, Raja Rammohan, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar did!!"},{"instruction":"What are tips on building customer loyalty in a local business?","output":"8 Ways to Create Real Customer Loyalty Set up ways to communicate with your customers.Provide extra perks for your most loyal customers.Consider different payment plans.Provide great customer service.Don't rely too much on technology.Offer a head start.Don't forget to smile.Give customers a reason to be loyal."},{"instruction":"Does Pink Floyd’s Dark side of the Moon album still have impact on today’s culture?","output":"Depends on what you mean. Are people still discovering new things in it? Well, no, cause it’s already been so thoroughly explored. But is its impact still felt? Yes, and it always will be because it changed the trajectory of western popular music. First off, DSOM was the first record intentionally engineered for headphones. It doesn’t have to be experienced that way, of course, but it was designed with that experience in mind. When you listen to it with cans on, the music doesn’t seem to be coming at you from a stage in front of you, which is how engineers at the time thought of the listener space, but rather it seems to exist all around you, and even to run through your head at times. This was an extension of the Floyd stage show, which was famous for tricks like making it sound like water was flowing down the aisles and other such outlandish effects. DSOM changed how everybody thought about making records. The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is often cited for its use of sound effects, orchestra, seamless segues, and psychedelic lyrics and soundscapes (much of it inspired by the work of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys) but not many people are aware that another band, Pink Floyd, were producing much weirder stuff at Abbey Road at the same time, and band members sometimes popped in on each other’s sessions. The groups were mutual fans, and John was first introduced to Yoko at a Floyd show at the UFO club. DSOM took all of that and pushed it harder than the Beatles or Brian Wilson had done while keeping the music mainstream. That album demonstrated that unapologetic psych/prog rock could not only be commercially viable, but could be a monster hit. We live in a post-DSOM world now. You can hear its influence in everything from rock to rap. There’s no way to wash it out of our clothes anymore. It will always be influential."},{"instruction":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","output":"One of the shrewdest and smartest maneuvers in business history is Apple's launch of the iPod and iTunes in 2001. At the time, the music industry was facing challenges from digital piracy and illegal file sharing. Apple's co-founder, Steve Jobs, recognized this as an opportunity and came up with a brilliant strategy to revolutionize the way music was consumed and purchased. Apple introduced the iPod, a sleek and user-friendly portable music player, and complemented it with iTunes, a digital music store where users could legally purchase and download songs for a nominal fee. The genius of this move was not just the innovative product itself, but also the way Apple approached the music industry. Jobs negotiated with major record labels to secure the rights to sell their music on iTunes, ensuring a wide selection of popular songs. He also convinced the labels to adopt a \\"single-track\\" pricing model, allowing customers to purchase individual songs instead of being forced to buy entire albums. This move addressed consumer demands for flexibility and affordability. By creating a seamless ecosystem of hardware, software, and content, Apple changed the music industry's landscape and established the dominance of legal digital music distribution. The iPod and iTunes became a massive success, revolutionizing how people consumed music and propelling Apple to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. This maneuver showcased the shrewdness and foresight of Apple's leadership team, who capitalized on the changing market dynamics to create a revolutionary product and business model that left a lasting impact on the music industry and beyond."},{"instruction":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","output":"I don’t think so.

Whereas other non Big 4 firms are far less strict and regimented about how you get the work done as long as it gets done. In the Big 4 you have compliance training requirements throughout the entire year, have to disclose all of your investments, the dress code is more formal etc. Basically it is much more strict and corporate. They also tend to pay slightly better than other firms at the manager level and above due to their huge profit margins and ability to up-sell their work."},{"instruction":"What are some first date tips?","output":"Here are some first date tips to help make your experience enjoyable and successful: Be Yourself: Authenticity is key.

Ask follow-up questions and engage in meaningful conversation.Avoid Controversial Topics: While open discussions are good, it's better to steer clear of highly controversial or sensitive subjects on the first date.Keep the Conversation Light: Share interesting stories, hobbies, and experiences without delving too deeply into personal matters.Mind Your Body Language: Maintain eye contact, smile, and use open body language to signal that you're engaged and interested.Offer Compliments: Compliments can help break the ice and create a positive atmosphere, but keep them sincere and appropriate.Put Away Your Phone: Focus on your date rather than your phone.

If they seem uncomfortable or disinterested, it might be time to change the topic or wrap up the date.Keep It Relatively Short: Aim for a relatively shorter first date, like grabbing coffee or having lunch, so that there's no pressure to spend too much time if things aren't clicking.Express Gratitude: Regardless of how the date goes, thank your date for their time and company.Leave Room for a Follow-up: If you're interested in seeing them again, express it in a positive way and suggest a future activity.Trust Your Instincts: If something doesn't feel right, it's okay to end the date early or decline a second date.Stay Safe: Meet in a public place and let a friend or family member know where you'll be.

Take Rahul Dravid for example. He is hardly seen in the media and rarely in the news for any reason. He knows what he is capable of and so do his fans and cricket followers, but no one shows it off. It is the same case with most other locals. They are brilliant, but not many outsiders know about them because they are hardly interested in publicising or marketing their skills by themselves. How many know Sir M Vishweshwaraya? Except a few engineering students in Karnataka, most don't even know his name, even though his contributions are as huge as say CV Raman! Even most of the common people are very humble, welcoming and most importantly feel secure without feeling threatened by external factors. Sometimes it can backfire, but since they have greatest pride in their culture, they don't need to worry about losing their identity. Having been in Bangalore for more than 15 years, I have seen the changes all these years and even though there were some extremist groups that tried to play the role of the proverbial bad apples, they are just fringe groups and the society has remained peaceful and safe from the external bad influences.

North Korea has succeeded. There are no Chinese characters in their language. Their language is different than the Korean in South Korea. In South Korea the Chinese characters are referred to as Hanja. Jecond the Great in 1346 revised the Chinese they were using and devised an alphabet of 10 vowels and 14 consonants. Korean became an alphabetical language and was written in syllabic bundles with one consonant and one vowel in each bundle. The Vietnamese didn't become involved with the Chinese language. When Confuscious had his greatest influence in China the Vietnemese were pulling away so they have few Chinese influences in their language. The advantages of this shift are more independence from a bigger country who may be after your resources but less help from that same country if someone else is picking on you and you need his help."},{"instruction":"Can you use a CB magnet antenna without a whip?","output":"No. The only purpose of the magnet is to hold the whip perpendicular to the roof of a car; the roff provides the ‘ground-plane” needed for the whip to work properly.

However, I think the USP of OnePlus of delivering a premium phone at a competitive price point makes it stand out among all other brands.

Indonesian migrant workers or those who qualify to work abroad mainly return home and do not look forward to stay permanently in their host countries. We also did not have civil war or got invaded by foreign powers in recent times. In this case, it is not always up to the host countries, it is up to Indonesians. We are known as happy-go-lucky people. We are not the richest country but most of us are quite content with our situation. Our country is not perfect but home is always home.

LOL LMAO When you walk past a worm on the street, do you stop and wonder what that worm is thinking about? Conversely, to the worm you are just a thing that passed by. The worm does NOT see you as being intelligent. There may be far more intelligent beings everywhere that just don’t care to be bothered with us and who we cannot even recognize as being intelligent because they are so far ahead of us.We have existed on this planet for a VERY long time and we cannot communicate with ANY of the lifeforms here yet. We can’t have a conversation with a monkey and monkeys are very close to humans genetically. Why do we assume we would be able to communicate with an alien life form?The very concept of ‘Intelligence’ is something WE invented to describe the difference between ourselves and the other lifeforms on the planet. It is specifically designed to flatter humans and may very well have no real substance whatsoever. Humans are ‘Intelligent’ because we characterize ourselves as being ‘Intelligent’. Without ever meeting a more ‘Intelligent’ being we simply cannot quantify our own ‘Intelligence’. We may very well be classified among the dumbest creatures in the universe.Snakes would be far more interesting to aliens than humans. Think about it, an alien visits the Earth and sees a snake, then he goes home ‘It sees in infrared, eats thing twice the size of it’s head and can move around with no arms or legs!’ Humans aren’t even the best designed creatures on Earth. You NEVER see an ant trip and fall like a klutz AND an ant can lift up to 800 times it’s own body weight without going ever to the gym. Or maybe there are ant gyms and we’re just too stupid to realize what they are.Part of our general justification for our ‘Intelligence’ is our ability to adapt and survive. There are organisms that have been on Earth for far longer than we can ever even begin to hope to survive. The Sun will die and kill us all and they will probably still be here for a while after we are gone. We did what was obviously needed to survive. These things were required by nature.Ancient Romans were every bit as ‘Intelligent’ as we are. They just had to follow the steps that lead to where we are today. People needed to invent the wheel, housing and things of that nature BEFORE they invented computers. An ‘Intelligent’ alien might not have a radio yet.Humans are pretty much the only creatures on the Earth ACTIVELY engaged in destroying their own habitat. I guess viruses do that as well but that’s NOT very ‘Intelligent’. Or, maybe it is. Maybe EVERY ‘Intelligent’ species destroys itself. Maybe that’s how the universe deals with ‘Intelligence’.We KNOW there are places we CAN’T go. There are galaxies that are BILLIONS of light years away. That means that, if you’re traveling at the speed of light, it will take you BILLIONS of years to get there. Even if we could travel that fast, we would STILL die before we got there.We lie to each other about science. There’s a huge you tube commercial campaign which talks about ‘uploading your consciousness to a mechanical body’ or some such nonsense. When you upload something, you don’t move it. You create a copy. The original file is still on your device. You would still die if somebody tried to ‘upload your consciousness’. And, yeah, there’s the old ‘we’ll figure it out’ excuse. But how? How would you know definitively that the consciousness you uploaded was the original? Maybe the process killed the original consciousness.

How do I find a place that could knit hats for me?","output":"Hmm. You might be able to find someone to do this through your local yarn shop. Some yarn shops are involved in charity knitting for premature babies or cancer patients, and they often sell their customers’ work on spec. However, you should expect it to cost you quite a lot more, and/or to receive a much higher- or lower-quality finished item than elsewhere. Personally, I do not knit for sale. I design patterns for other people to knit. For a hat pattern in 3 sizes, I would expect to receive £200–400 for the written instructions and charts,sufficient free-to-me yarn to produce one sample for photography, the sample to be returned to me, andreturn to me of full publishing rights within 4 months to 2 years, and I’m cheap. You should see what the Big Designers get. I do sometimes sell samples, but usually I keep them for talks and workshops.

They have a code of conduct like any medical professional. If she is throwing up and peeing everywhere she is in distress and she needs to see a vet right away. That is definitely the first step and don’t worry, the vet won’t kill your cat in front of you. her distress could be physical but it could psychological. She may feel threatened by a family that wants to kill her. . Perhaps you need to see what is wrong with the cat first and then have a talk with your family, and explain that vets will not put a cat down unless it is suffering horribly and that you will be very upset and angry if they harm the cat. But please do not take her to the humane society if you can find another option because there are so many abandoned cats.

Pfizer originally intended the medicine to help people with high blood pressure but it caused one side effect on people suffering from erectile dysfunction by causing stronger and lasting erections. Erectile dysfunction had been a known issue then but there wasn’t a cure developed for it. So, Pfizer realized that they had solved a major problem prevalent not just in North America but all over the world. So to market this product, they went to several media houses who weren’t very willing to be open about this issue on their covers and front pages considering the taboo that surrounded erectile dysfunction due to the country still being conservative at that time. So Pfizer decided to have a press conference where the presenter started to strip down naked and then proceeded to swallow one of the Viagra pills to publicly demonstrate the effect of the medicine by showing their erection to the people present there. Naturally, this became a huge headline and almost every media house and newspaper covered this story and criticized Pfizer and Viagra on how this is not the right way to go about things but this helped people notice and know that Viagra as a solution exists considering the sizeable number of people suffering from this illness and that they could easily acquire it from their nearby chemists, this was one of the reasons why Pfizer grew really fast in the subsequent years.

The skilled migration program, for example, provides opportunities for skilled individuals to obtain permanent residency based on their qualifications, work experience, and other criteria. Australia is also known for its multicultural society, and immigrants have played a significant role in shaping the country's cultural diversity. The Australian government has implemented various initiatives to support the settlement and integration of immigrants, including providing resources for language learning, employment support, and community programs. It's important to note that individual experiences as an immigrant can vary greatly depending on personal circumstances, cultural background, and other factors. While many immigrants have positive experiences and find Australia to be welcoming, others may face challenges during the settlement process. It's always recommended to research and understand the specific immigration programs, policies, and support services available before considering immigration to any country, including Australia."},{"instruction":"What are the six types of crystal shapes?","output":"There are 47 different crystal forms (form is the name given to a collection of identical faces related by symmetry operations) generated by the 32 possible combinations of symmetry operations (rotation, reflection, inversion and rotoinversion) that define the crystal classes (or point groups). These 32 crystal classes are grouped in the 6 main systems named in one of the other answers. The first row, in the table below, is the cross section of the pyramid, dipyramid or prism shown in the rows that follow. This is why the numbering starts with the shapes of the 2nd row. (This table appears in International Tables for Crystallography (2016). Vol. A, Section 3.2.1, pp. 720–737, where credit is given to Shubnikov & Koptsik, 1974, p. 74.) Each form has a name. The class notes posted by professor Nelson from Tulane University give the individual names (though not in the order of their numbering above) at [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/forms_zones_habit.htm] [URL: https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/forms_zones_habit.htm]When a crystal is well developed, it may display more than one type of form, or several variations of the same form (e.g. dipyramids that are more or less acute, and a prism). Therefore, a single form name may not describe entirely a given crystal shape. Mineralogists and crystallographers use a system of numerical indices (Miller indices) to refer to the faces because it is a comact notation that describes the relative position of the “planes” (faces) relative to a set of axes consistent with the symmetry of each crystal system. So the 47 kinds of forms, even though some cannot be found combined on the same crystal, give you a LOT of possible crystal shapes…"},{"instruction":"f Kurds are liberal, why don't they keep dogs like Turks?","output":"Is this an AI generated question? A) Kurds are human and they are plenty, 15 million many in Turkiye. Are there any population who are 15 million strong and none of them liberal? Ofcourse many of Kurds of Turkiye are liberal, where are these nonesense gossips coming from? B) Who told Turks keep dogs? What does keeping a dog means? Owning a dog as a pet or like putting dogs in chain to guard a village villa? All kinds of keeping a dog works? If you are talking about having a dog as a pet in homes, only city dwelling modern people do that in Turkiye. That is equal among Turks and Kurds as both ethnicities are populating cities mostly. C) What is the relationship between being liberal and having dogs? Since when having a pet was a symptom of liberalism? I never read that anywhere. Seriously, are people who dislike dogs count as nonliberal? Pet owning sociologically is about having small families or not even having any. Thus is the modern western capitalist post industrialized sense, people lost their villages where they lived as big/grand families for education and jobs in cities. And birthrates fall in this competitive system. Yet human seek friendship and family. So more people own cats and dogs in modern cities than rural, oldschool villages and town. This has nothing to do with ethnicities though.

Both sound the same to me as they both provide the environment to run a specific software.","output":"Emulators emulate conditions (usually hardware) To run software in. They take a piece of software which could not run on the current system and create a sandbox for it to run in. Docker containers take your current core OS (Linux for example) and build abstraction layers on top of it to run an application in a notionally different, but reproducible , system. It can not emulate different hardware or infrastructure than your system. It simply allows you to say, “given my current known starting point give me a sandbox with the following things installed, then run my app”. The tools solve different problems. Emulators are solving the “I can’t possibly run this application, no matter what prerequisite I install, on my current system” problem. Docker solves the “I either want a reproducible way to run my application given my current system or don’t want the prerequisites installed on my host machine” problem. If anything confusing VMs and Docker containers make more sense, as at least they solve similar problems with slightly different benefits. For a solid example: I would use an emulator to run a Nintendo game on a win32 machine or a windows application on Linux or Mac. These systems simply CANT natively run the applications without an emulator. I would run a Linux microservice in a Linux Docker container, if I wanted to be able to bundle the prereqs as a part of the build, make t reproducible for other people, or simply didn’t want to bother with installing a complicated prerequisite (like odbc drivers) onto my host machine. In this case I totally could run the app locally but don’t to solve a different pain point.

I’ve focused on the New Zealand part of the book, but it gives a taste of just how dodgy the whole publication is. Zheng He is not a name that is well known in the west. However, his seven voyages from China, through the Indian Ocean to Africa between 1405 and 1435 would place him among the world’s great explorers. Yet retired submarine captain Gavin Menzies is convinced Zheng He’s feats were even greater. He believes a massive Chinese fleet conducted four simultaneous circumnavigations of the world between 1421 and 1423, during which they discovered the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, even Antarctica. But while they were away, the Chinese emperor turned his back on the outside world and, when the ships returned, had all mention of them erased. Why the records of Zheng He’s other expeditions were kept, Menzies does not explain. As Menzies tells it, he was set on his own personal voyage after viewing some early European maps. He claims these have details that could not have been known to Europeans at the time, and concludes only the Chinese could have mounted expeditions to map these areas. The Europeans then copied the Chinese charts. One is the Piri Reis map, which Erich von Däniken made so much of, with different conclusions. Another, the Jean Rotz map, shows land stretching to the south and east of Australia. Menzies argues this was solid ice stretching from Tasmania to the Auckland and Campbell Islands. What appear on the map to be rivers, Menzies interprets as harbours on these islands, which were, he claims, “at the normal limit of the pack ice that links them in midwinter.” Of course, they’re actually ice-free year round. After mapping this region, Menzies says the Chinese sailed north to New Zealand, pausing in Fjordland (sic) to drop off some giant ground sloths (which have been extinct for 10,000 years), collected in South America. A teak ship was then wrecked on Ruapuke Beach, south of Raglan, “near the mouth of the Torei Palma River” [I later figured out that this “river” must be the outlet drain from the Toreparu Wetland - at normal flows you can easily jump across it.] Further evidence cited includes a brass bell found in the area which bears a Tamil inscription (a Tamil ship must have joined the fleet for trading purposes, he says), some rocks with Tamil inscriptions on them, and a carved stone duck which resembles a Chinese votive offering. European cartographers then somehow got hold of the charts drawn by the expedition before the Chinese authorities destroyed them, and copied down the ice sheet to the south of Australia, but left out New Zealand, and, for that matter, most of China itself. It doesn’t take much research (using the same sources that Menzies consulted) to establish that the Ruapuke wreck (which originally came to light in the 1870s) was actually made from totara, the bell was found in the central North Island, the rock inscriptions are Maori, and the duck’s provenance is dubious, but unlikely to be Chinese. The whole book is like this. There is no logic whatever as he leaps from one piece of “incontrovertible” evidence to the next. The only mystery is how a reputable publisher could lavish such attention (the book is beautifully produced) on the kind of writing that is usually found in cheap pulp paperbacks. There’s talk of a TV series too."},{"instruction":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","output":"It is important to remember that your son may have a passion for music and it is important to respect that.

Then a Target opened in my city (which, btw, is emphatically not close to the US border so I had no experience with American Target). The stuff was just trash. It was obviously really poor quality, and there wasn’t a ton of selection; and while the prices were not super expensive, they were still more than what I thought the stuff was worth. And given that you could very easily go to say, Walmart, and get a similar (or better) quality item for a better price, why go to Target? It was honestly slightly insulting. Given the big fanfare over Target, to see them sell such junk there, it was like they thought they could stock their stores with whatever and we’d just swallow it down cos we’d be so happy to have the chance to finally shop there. I know a few people who felt that way, anyway. The weird thing is, being in Australia now, Target’s stuff here is way better than it was in Canada. I have bought a few things there, whereas despite a few trips to Canadian Target, I never bought a thing there - never even tried anything on, and not even when they had their closing sales."},{"instruction":"What does a psychotic episode look like?","output":"A person is confused and their behaviour is erratic and irrational."},{"instruction":"there a right way which finger to use when reading sheet music?

Firstly, the body can adapt to a certain eating pattern over time. When someone consistently eats only once or twice a day, their body can adjust and become accustomed to this routine. This means that the person may not experience hunger pangs or cravings during the times when they are not eating. Secondly, the type of food that someone eats can affect their hunger levels. Foods that are high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats can help to keep a person feeling full for longer periods. This means that someone who eats a meal that is rich in these nutrients may not feel hungry for several hours afterward. Thirdly, hydration can play a role in managing hunger. Sometimes, what feels like hunger pangs can be a sign of dehydration. Drinking water or other fluids can help to keep the body hydrated and reduce feelings of hunger. Lastly, some people may simply have a lower appetite or slower metabolism, which means they can go for longer periods without feeling hungry. It's important to note that while some people may choose to eat only once or twice a day, this eating pattern may not be suitable for everyone.

This image is one in a series, you can see the atoms in strands, though this is only a fraction of what the human eye is capable of or can detect and resolve.

This one is taken in less than a second from the last, the atoms undergoing energy absorptions, spectrally glowing as they become electromagnetically charged and altered.

The Guards division is a historic one, they’re the oldest regiments in the British Army and date back to when it first became professional in the 16th-17th centuries, mostly. During that time they were the ones who performed the guarding of the royal household. They, for centuries, have also fought the country’s wars, from the civil war to the Napoleon Wars, the World Wars, Falklands and recently deployed on multiple occasions to Afghanistan and Iraq. However, they’re no more trained as an infantry soldiers than any other infantry unit than any other line regiment in the British Army, The role they play at the palaces is merely ceremonial one that’s born of tradition, something the British military is steeped in. They are not there to actually guard anything, Armed Police and security officers are there to do that. Trust me, nobody standing with parade like stillness has any sense of what’s going on in their peripheries. If they were actually guarding something they wouldn’t be so rigid.

Indeed, both Denmark and Canada have flirted with banning it because of certain food additives used in its production. It was once used as the ‘mystery ingredient’ that had to be included on an American cookery programme. None of the contestants had any idea of how strong the flavour is and were dolloping it into their creations by the ladleful (ok, slight exaggeration…). The results were all totally inedible. The trick to enjoying it is to use it very sparingly in order to appreciate its savoury qualities. I usually mix a teaspoon with half a pound of butter and keep it in the fridge to spread on my toast. Any stronger and I can feel the surface of my tongue being stripped back to a Teflon-like smoothness. The flavoured butter is also great for frying bacon, mushrooms and steak.

Along with this, the role also focuses on client needs and expectations from a business in the digital era, i.e., on the online platform. The main role of a BA is to understand the requirements of the stakeholders from the organisation and to analyse and implement these changes by forming strategies by means of data collection and analysis of the current market situation. The same applies to a digital business analyst but a digital business analyst is more centric towards the online market analysis and data orientation than the traditional BA. In short, a digital business analyst pitches the organisation about the digital transformation while keeping both the business and customer satisfaction in mind. Why did the role of business analysts shift digital? The reasons are pretty simple. Even though businesses expect pretty much the same outputs from a BA, they have a more centric approach to the functioning of these professionals. With the transformations happening so rapidly in technology, businesses have adapted to this atmosphere and shifted online too. Businesses want their digital dominance to compete and stand out from others. Therefore, the role of business analysts has shifted from offline to online. The two most important factors which contributed towards the drastic shift could be: • Technological Advancements: With technology growing and advancing every day, businesses have changed their platforms from offline to online. A need for establishing an online presence has become a necessity. Thus, businesses are now demanding business analysts who have knowledge about technical analysis along with non-technical skills.• Customer Predominance: As the world is growing online, so is the market. A lot of people who own business in similar fields now have an option to expose their business online. Due to this, the need for changing towards online markets and targeting their desired audience has become a need for the hour for most of the business. With so many options available and with an increase in competition, the customer has become the king. The need to understand the customer behaviour on the online platform is the most important goal for any business. By understanding their needs and the current market trends on the digital platform, organisations are trying to keep up with the changing times. What are the skills required for a Digital Business Analyst? The interpersonal skills which a digital business analyst requires are more or less the same as any other business analysts. To name a few we could list- • Interpersonal skills• Problem-solving skills• Analytical and decision-making skills• Strong Presentation skills All these skills are shifted online. To be more precise, the skills are used for the promotions, presence and profit making of the business on a digital platform. The other technical skills include- • Web development• Social media strategy planning• Programming languages• Data analysis and Design thinking• Statistical analysis and critical thinking• In-depth Domain knowledge• Customer behaviour• SEM• PPC• SEO• Advance Excel• Tableau• SQL By possessing the knowledge about these technical and non-technical skills, a digital business analyst improves his chance of getting hired than others. Why is Digital [LINKED_TEXT: Business Analytics ] [URL: https://businesstoys.in/programs/business-analyst-certification-program/]a preferred career option? The industry is now looking for professionals who have great digital knowledge of business analytics over traditional business analysts. As we mentioned about the changing business trends, an organisation prefers a digital business analyst to meet the right organisational goals along with profits. Thus, a digital business analyst plays an important role in the changing and fast-moving technical world: By implementing the current need of the market, the digital business analyst would be the perfect choice for the candidates who wish to pursue a career in the same field. What should the ideal learning pattern for a business analyst look like? • The right digital business analytic guidance is the one that offers a learning pattern including technical and non-technical skills.• It should cover all the key highlights that are important for a business analyst starting with the basics of business analytics and climbing up the staircase to advanced topics. These include the use of tools like SQL and Tableau and programming languages as well.• Working on live projects is a part of the curriculum. So, look for the course that offers you workshops about real-time projects in the field of digital business analytics.• The most important thing to look at before enrolling for a course in business analytics is to check if the certification offered by them is recognised and accepted in the industry.• Along with this, it is important to check if the certificate offered by the institute is valid.• The next important thing to make sure about is the placements offered.

If there were a legitimate and/ or logical arguement in favor of gun control, it would have been presented long ago. For lack of a viable case, the anti- gun community only has emotion and ad hominem attacks. Now to convince you that gun regulation isn't a good thing. Historically, when governments have restricted or removed guns from their people it goes badly for the people as criminals already don't care about laws so they will remain armed. King George attempted to take the people's guns which is part of the reason the people wanted the right to bare arms be protected. (i.e. the 2nd Amendment). Every major city in America has high gun violence numbers and the more gun control legislation/ laws put in place, the higher the gun violence per capita. This isn't a mystery, just facts that people like to ignore.

How big is a big cat? Adult snow leopards are the smallest species of Big Cats, with adult snow leopards usually weigh 22 to 55 kg (49 to 121 lb), with an exceptional specimen reaching 75 kg (165 lb). When it comes to size the Dire Wolf was larger than the Gray Wolf (and about twice the size of the snow leopard), averaging about 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and weighing between 50 kilograms (110 lbs) and more than 79 kilograms (174 lbs). So in terms of size the Dire Wolf was a Big Dog. The Gray Wolf is still around and they get to about 80 kg. Still much larger than the smallest Big Cat. So in terms of size as defined by the size range of Big Cats there are Big Dogs. But what makes a Big Cat a Big Cat is their ability to roar. Dogs as far as we know have never roared so they can’t be called Big Dogs if that is part of the definition. So either size defines a Big Cat, in which case there are Big Dogs, or the ability to roar defines a Big Cat, and there can’t be a Big Dog because they can’t roar. If that is the case there are no Big Dogs because of their larynx being wrong for producing a roaring sound."},{"instruction":"f you and your wife were laying in bed and you both hear a noise downstairs at 3 AM, do you believe that it is your duty as a man to investigate the noise and put yourself at potential risk to protect you and your wife?

The Other woman I will neither divorce my husband nor let him take another wife, she said holding his hand tightly. He is my man. First time since last one month he felt relieved. It sounds so good to hear my man from her mouth. It feels, so better thinking she is by his side now. How fool I was to act so childishly? He thought while looking at her. She looks so radiant. The dark circle under her eye made him feel guilty, guilty of making her go through all that mess. And he promised himself that he will never hurt her again. Aakash, Aakash a voice screamed. That was Sonal screaming on top of her voice. Did you just hear what she said? How can she do that to us? Why aren’t you saying anything? He looked at Sonal, a beautiful girl in her late twenties. With those beautiful black eyes and slender face, that can make any guy fall for her. She was a beauty, flawless skin, straight nose, long curly jet black hair. She turned red in anger. How can you do that to us? He is mine, said Sonal, and I am going to fight till the end for my love. Aakash why aren’t you saying anything? Please tell her how much we love each other? Tell her that you can’t live without me. Sorry Sonal, his first words, since last one hour. I was wrong. I was wrong to think that I am in love with you. I can’t be. I can’t be in love with you. What the hell are you saying? Rohan, Sonal’s brother. 6 feet tall, well build Rohan was holding his anger till now, but couldn’t hold his anger now, said furiously. What the hell are you saying? After going around with my sister since last six months. Now realized that you don’t love her anymore? You are playing with her life. I will not leave you. Sonal was shocked to hear these words from Aakash. What is the problem darling? Is your wife threatening you? Tell me? Don’t you worry about her? We will take care of her. No Sonal, you heard me clearly I am not going to divorce her – Aakash And no, it is my decision to stay in this marriage. I know I have made a mistake. Mistake? You call it a mistake? You call my love a mistake? Those beautiful moments we spent together? Those cosy nights that we spent in each other arms you call it a mistake? For the first time during the last few hours, she felt uncomfortable thinking about those nights. But then she took hold of herself and pushed away all those thoughts. No, not now she said to her thoughts. Three nights, to be precise, she said calmly. He couldn’t dare to look at her. How can he? Sonal said, No, I am not going to leave you like this. I will teach you a lesson, a lesson that you will never forget in your entire life. I am going to go to police and the media. I am going to register a case. I am going to tell the world how you used me. I am going to lodge a complaint that you raped me under a false promise to marry me and now you are not honoring you promise. You are free to do what pleases you. But let me tell you before you register an FIR. I have already registered a case against you, she said. What? Sonal, Case against me? On what ground? You were trying to steal my husband. You lure him in your love and were blackmailing him – She What the hell? Sonal Yes. You lured him. You knew very well he is married and has two kids. Still, you got close to him. Didn’t you know he was married? When you guys first met in the gym? Didn’t you know he has two kids while you slept with him? In spite of knowing all this if you still choose to sleep with him, what does it mean? By this time Rohan and Sonal realized, she is a tough nut. It is not going to be that easy. Yes. I was aware. But I never decided to fall in love. It just happened – Sonal. No. It was pre-planned. You changed your gym timing every time to match his timings. You changed your office shift time to match his. You deliberately used to miss your pick up van so that you can take a lift from him. You must be a fool to think I didn’t notice all this, she said. Aakash thought for a moment were she really aware of all this or this is just her homework? He knew very well what his wife is capable of? If it comes to investigating something she can bet the CBI. She has an eye for detail. If she decides anything she will move a mountain from here to there. She was really a tough lady. Your bank transaction can very well prove that you were blackmailing him, Oh ho one more thing, I happen to meet Mrs. Gupta last week. Mrs. Gupta sister of your previous landlord Mr. Arora. Mr. Arora has expressed his interest to be my witness if need be. By now both brother and sister realized now the time has come to wrap up. Otherwise, the situation will be out of control. Don’t you get my sister’s character in between? We also have many things to talk about Mr. Arora. But I don’t want to go down to that level. He added if you want all this to end and don’t want any embarrassment, then pay us 5 Lakh and will not go to the media. 5 Lakh for what? For sleeping with my husband? She said. Mind your language? Said Sonal, I am not a prostitute. I don’t sleep with people for money. Oh ho but your brother just suggested that we should pay your 5 lakh. And we take money in exchange for either service… Sonal interrupted, We are asking for compensation, compensation for the mental and physical harassment that I went through since last six months. But a few minutes back you were talking about Love, and beautiful moments, cozy nights and now you are saying all that was harassment,she said. Rohan, see Mam (trying to be as polite as possible), there is no point in stretching the matter, let us close it matter on 2.5 Lakh No, she said. There was silence for a few minutes. I will pay you 1 Lakh, not a rupee more or rupee less. This is all I can do and any more word from you this amount will reduce to 0 (zero). Both sister and brother said at the same time We agree. I will have it deposited in your account by tomorrow evening. And if you try to act any smart you know whom are you dealing with –She They both looked at each other and acknowledge that never in future then will come ever closer to Aakash. She is a tough lady Rohan said to Sonal while entering in the lift. Aakash closing the door behind. By this time she went into the kitchen to prepare dinner. It was a long day. Why are we paying 1 lakh to them he asked She offered you her services for six months. I mean she entertained you for six months, she needs to be paid well. Don’t you think so? she said He looked away. I am sorry, he said. He meant. I will never.. She interrupted if you don’t mind, can you get rice from the general store. We are running out of rice. He realized she wanted to be left alone. He went to get the rice. Leaning against the dining table, she couldn’t control her tears. The thought of he choosing younger women over her was killing her from inside. Maybe it was her ego. Why are you doing this? If it is hurting you so badly? Why? Why? She sister over the phone last week. Because I want to see him alive, she said. What do you mean? Her sister He tried to commit suicide. Twice, she said. What? Her sister Yes, and a second time it was very close to death. Had it been delayed for a few minutes he would have been dead. When he gained consciousness, all that he said was “Save me only if you are coming back to me”. Babu, I can’t live without you. I know I have made a mistake. But only god knows it was not Sonal it was you, for me. Even then, even now. The face was that of Sonal but it was you that I was falling for. I was looking for you in her. I made a mistake to look for you outside of you. Please don’t go. If you leave me, I will leave this world. Please take me back. Hmm.. Her sister, that was a brave decision, but you must remember once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast. She repeated her sister’s last line to herself. And then the doorbell rang. It was him. She opened the door. Looking deep into his eyes, she smiled from the bottom of her heart. And he knew he got her back. She hugged him tightly."},{"instruction":"w do you calculate","output":"To quickly calculate the sum of consecutive numbers like 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10, you can use a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is given by: Sn = (n/2)(a + l), where Sn is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, the first term is 1 and the last term is 10. We can plug these values into the formula: Sn = (10/2)(1 + 10) = (5)(11) = 55.

Even given that explanation after abandoning the chaos theory claim, the casino refused to pay up. Corriveau took them to court and won his winnings.

He realized if he saw that pattern there was a 95% chance the ticket was a winner. It gave him no information about the size of the win. It could be a free play. It could be 2. It could be 200. Instead of mortgaging his home and buying every Tic Tac Toe scratcher he could get his hands on, he called the Ontario Lottery to warn them. They treated him as a bit of a crank. Now, in fairness, I’m sure lotteries get such crank calls all the time. “I figured out a way to beat your lottery. Pay me now or I’ll reveal it to the world!” Undeterred by the lottery official’s blow off, Srivastava did his civic duty and persisted. He bought a stack of tickets he knew would be winners. And he bought a stack that lacked the pattern. He sent both stacks (unscratched) via mail to the lottery head office. He wrote on a note “Stack A is 95% winners. Stack B is losers. Test it yourself. Want to know how I did it? Call me.” They did.

Though I am not a dedicated blogger, I have published a few articles and believe I can contribute my expertise. Since 2018, Target Internet has visited 10 of the world's highest-earning blogs once a year. Using a list based on Forbes' list of the world's highest-earning bloggers, we evaluated some of the factors driving each big blogger's success. Consider Digital Vidya's Certified Digital Marketing Master's Course if you want to learn how to start your own blog. Blogging has recently evolved into many other forms, ranging from conventional, proprietary blogs (such as the one you're reading) to blogging on third-party platforms like Quora, Medium and LinkedIn Pulse, and micro-blogging in social media captions. The blogging sector has been further divided into bloggers and social media influencers. Many people who would have become bloggers are now pursuing jobs as influencers. These shifts have given independent online content creators additional commercial and artistic options. The disadvantage is that blogging has grown more difficult to identify, and hence more difficult to report on as an industry. This influence has been so strong that the term \\"blogging\\" appears to be losing favor. According to Google Trends, global search traffic for 'blogging' and associated terms reached its lowest point on record in June 2019, and has been nearly flat since. As a result of these shifts, it is no longer simple to obtain reliable figures on bloggers' salaries from respectable sources, as publications such as Forbes have refocused on trendy topics such as Instagrammers and YouTubers. This may have been the clue to quit analyzing the performance of top compensated bloggers. Let's take a close look at each prominent blog's position in 2020.

He studied contemporary dance for years and due to BTS’s style of dance he usually doesn’t get to showcase it too much so when he gets to do his solos he really gets to show who he is individually as an artist. That’s why I love solo sets, even though BTS is a seven member group… in a sense they are seven individual artists with unique voices and artistic ways of expressing themselves, so during a solo set you really get to see a better view of who that individual artist is. Again, with Filter he really showed his style of dance and really embodied his song and the meaning of this song as he’s explained it before. By changing out his outfits and trying on different clothes during his performance he’s showing these different filters we put on based on who we are tryin to impress, interacting with or just to fit in to society. He also did a sensual contemporary, Latin inspired dance style which fit the song perfectly. He is the one member too, and this is common in contemporary not hip hop style, who really used his back up dancers to tell a story. Whether its through lifting him up or having them help him dress and undress he fully utilizes all the dancers on the stage while most artists just have them in the background. And obviously the man seriously looked LETHAL. He knew dang well what he was doing in the red and purple suit and doing some of those “movements”. He is a dancer, like Taemin, who is able to really be sensual without showing any skin (not that there’s anything wrong with that). As people famously say “to the demon who possesses Park Jimin on stage, thank you”. I’ll leave this answer with a gif of fully possessed Jimin."},{"instruction":"The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws. What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"No state can “void” a federal law, but they also cannot be compelled to enforce it or to cooperate with federal officials trying to enforce it. Just as some cities refuse to enforce or cooperate with immigration law, states and cities can do the same in regard to gun laws. In cases where states refuse to cooperate with federal law, there’s nothing the government can do. There’s no law that requires states to enforce federal statutes."},{"instruction":"Does Orthodox Judaism hold that Lucifer is not evil and is in fact YHWH’s servant?","output":"There is no “Lucifer” in Judaism. The whole “war in heaven” and battle between the angels is part of Christian teaching but simply does not feature in Judaism at all. There is an angel, or possibly a group of angels, traditionally referred to as “the Satan”. Angels have no free will and can only do as they are told to do by the divine will in Jewish teaching, so these beings are not evil- their job is, in traditional stories, to do quality control on humanity and report back their findings. They are no more “evil” than someone in a factory performing stress tests on a new product. But they do try to tempt humans to do evil. That’s their job- to test people out and see how they respond to the temptation to do bad things. They aren’t that invested in the out come though- they don’t get the souls to play with in hell or anything, they just expose the flaws in creation and find the weak spots."},{"instruction":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","output":"Kippers in custard. Really."},{"instruction":"My mom refuses to give my dad my passport and other documents. What can my dad do (he's my biological, but his name isn't on my birth certificate)?","output":"If your dad raised you, he has parental rights in most states regardless of biology so it doesn't matter if he is on your birth certificate. He can go to court and get his parental rights validated and the judge will deal with the passport issue. If your biological father did not raise you then he needs to go to Family Law Court with the DNA proof and establish himself as your father. The court will usually grant a visitation schedule for the additional family member (the court does this with grandparents also) and if your father wants to take you traveling (in or out of the country) he can request that the court allow for this. If the court approves the travel, then your mother will be forced to give him your passport. Or, you can wait until you're 18 and travel with your father as a young adult. Please remember that your mother knew your father as an adult before you were born (obviously). She may have reason to hold back your passport. She may be trying to protect you, so her stubborn refusal may have very good intentions. Non-custodial parents leaving the country and not returning with their children is an ongoing problem in Family Law Courts and a horrible, living nightmare for the parent left behind. It is nearly impossible to get children back to the U.S. from certain countries, even if the children want to return. For this reason, all parents who are not married and want to travel internationally with their children must go through channels to prove that they will return with their children. Your father is no exception. Lawyers are not required to appear in Family Law Court, neither is U.S. citizenship. There is a self help desk at the courthouse that will help your father go to court to get a judge to decide about the passport. It will be a good test for him to see if he is willing to go through the process or if he is just trying to take you away from your mother to live with his family. It is best for you to have all of the people who love you in your life. I hope that your parents will work together (and let the court assist them) to make this happen."},{"instruction":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","output":"Just open with MS office word 2010 or later version and choose pdf format at the time of saving"},{"instruction":"What are the three components of the cell theory?","output":"The universe is assessed to contain somewhere in the range of 100 and 200 billion worlds.

It had never occurred to me that resumes are being combed through by someone other than the person doing the hiring. Here is my experience though: During the Great Recession I applied at Macy’s for a seasonal Christmas job in 2009. I was overqualified for this retail position of stocking shelves or operating a cash register, but I felt I needed to apply to anything out there. They could see my job experience on my resume but I was called in for an interview. I sat before a girl half my age and she told me that the job was already filled. If this were true, then why would they not have called to cancel the interview? I felt that they were screening out people that were “too old”. The next year 2010 I was STILL unemployed and now I am feeling desperate since there had been no openings in my field. Again, I saw the ad for Macy’s seasonal help and I applied again. It was like deja vu. I was called in for an interview, I came in and sat before someone half my age, and again was told the position had been filled. While I was uncertain the year before that Macy’s would screen out people based on age, now I was certain they do. Fortunately after New Years 2011, I was able to get employment in my field. If there are any Macy’s executives out there reading this, shame on you. You have terrible employment practices. I boycott your store and I hope others do as well. UPDATE: IN 2018 the local Macy’s store closed it’s doors for good. I guess boycotting stores with bad business practices works."},{"instruction":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","output":"Not the US government, it was the British government, when the USA was still a group of colonies. Here are some of the big reasons. But if you want to know why the USA is the way it is, read the declaration of Independence. The governor's of the colonies were unable to pass laws of “great local importance” in the colonies without assent from the king. The king refused to pass laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless the people gave up their right of representation in the legislature. The king called legislative bodies together at odd unusual and distant locations. The king routinely dissolved legislative bodies in the colonies. After the dissolution of those bodies the king stalled elections to reelect new bodies The king obstructed the creation of laws to implement judiciary bodies in the colonies Judges were dependent on the king's will for tenure of their offices and salary Armies were stationed in the colonies in times of peace without concent of the colonies The cost of those unwanted standing armies was charged to the colonies.

What do I do?","output":"Things to Do Differently If You’re Working Out Regularly but Not Seeing the Workout Results You Want 1. Make small but meaningful changes to your current routine. Sometimes tweaking your go-to workout (as well as adding some completely new exercises) can make a difference. \\"For example, at Flywheel where I teach, if you do the same RPM [or speed] but increase intensity, it’s a different workout,\\" celebrity trainer Lacey Stone, tells SELF. \\"If you increase the speed on the treadmill by one or two [miles per hour], it’s a different workout.\\" Lifting heavier than normal, or working out for longer, can both be helpful changes, too. Aguiar adds, \\"Make sure you’re only changing one thing at a time, and be very specific.\\" If you're increasing the weight you're lifting, don't also add reps. \\"Pick one thing—duration, intensity, or load. 2. Take active recovery days. Active recovery is any workout that gets you moving but still lets your muscles recover fully—which is important so your body can reap the benefits of exercise without getting too burned out. A slow run, long walk, and yoga are all great forms of active recovery. This is a great way to keep your body moving (and burning more calories than you would if you took a full-on rest day) while still giving your body and mind a much-needed break from strenuous activity. 3. Watch portion sizes. There are several problems with counting calories for weight loss. For one, it can be annoying and time-consuming to track every single bite. In addition, calculating how many calories you need is incredibly complicated, and most formulas are inaccurate. A better solution for many people is to be mindful of portion sizes. To be honest, it can be really hard to control portion sizes, especially if you're eating out at restaurants and being served two times the size of a healthy portion. 4. Try something completely different. \\"If you are somebody who does the same thing every time and you have been doing that for years, then you need to switch it up,\\" Chelsea Aguiar, founder of Athaya Fitness, tells SELF. When your body gets used to the same movements, it no longer has to adapt to keep up. \\"During physique changes and body composition changes, your body is adapting. When you're trying to make progress, you always want your workout to feel challenging. 5. Prioritize sleep. Weight loss especially is impacted by so many more factors than just diet and exercise. Getting poor sleep can sabotage your weight-loss efforts in a few ways. Being sleep-deprived impacts the hormones that control appetite, urging you to snack and prompting you to reach for quick energy—usually highly caloric sugary and fatty foods. Lack of sleep can also slow down your metabolism and simply leave you with too little energy to work out. 6. Work out less often. This might sound counterintuitive, but if you're working out so frequently that you're feeling burnt out, you may not really be getting much out of some of those workouts. Fitness pros emphasize the importance of taking a break so your body can recovery properly and so you have enough energy to come back to your next workout full force. If you're hitting the gym every single day and feeling exhausted, take a day off, get some rest, and see if you have more energy and stamina during your next workout.

I’m 46 and have lived my entire life in Cerritos, California, which is about 20 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Cerritos and Southern California are both nice enough and have a lot to offer, but I’m ready to move on nevertheless. For one, it’s so populated and crowded here. There’s very little nature or open space left anywhere in So. Cal — and for a nature-loving guy, that just sucks. It’s basically wall-to-wall development, with an endless array of freeways, strip malls, housing developments, and cities. To access nature or to simply go on a country drive, one has to drive long distances, either up into the mountains or way out in some of the less developed parts of the Inland Empire. Being surrounded by so much asphalt and concrete and sprawl is rather depressing! Second, the traffic and overcrowdedness of the area is stifling. Virtually no place in So. Cal is immune from traffic jams and gridlock. Even some of the more rural areas in the I.E have bad traffic. And forget about driving up to the mountains to ski or play in the snow right after a fresh snowfall: half of So. Cal is likely going to be heading up there, too, which means heavy traffic both going up and down the mountain. And if chains are required at all, get ready for a really frustrating adventure! And the beaches? Good luck finding a parking spot on a warm, sunny day. And if you do find a spot, get ready to spend a good sum for the privilege. Lastly, I find the weather/climate here boring and dull. Sunny Southern California is a very real thing. It’s nice, however, in that we lack the extreme heat and cold that impacts other areas of the country; we don’t get hurricanes or tornadoes; we don’t get blizzards and ice storms; and we don’t get oppressive heat and humidity very often — so the So. Cal climate patterns are generally mild. However, the lack of rain, the constant sunshine, and the unseasonably long summer season (generally we stay warm well into November) gets a bit dull and monotonous. It’s not rare for it to be 80 degrees on Thanksgiving and Christmas, which is nice if you are a surfer, but abysmal if you like the holiday weather to reflect the actual time of year.

They’re under the impression that if they create enough confusion and doubt as to whether the laws apply to them, that they can do what they want without any consequences. Sovereign citizens have several explanations of where America went wrong, but the basic thinking argues that, at some point, popular sovereignty was abandoned in favour of admiralty law—the law of the sea and international commerce. According to the [LINKED_TEXT: Southern Poverty Law Center] [URL: https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement]: \\"Under common law, or so they believe, the sovereigns would be free men. Under admiralty law, they are slaves, and secret government forces have a vested interest in keeping them that way.\\" And so sovereigns assert that when they are tried at a court flying an admiralty flag (i.e., an American flag with gold fringe), said court holds no jurisdiction over them and the case should be dropped. Further, that \\"some point\\" where the U.S. forfeited its legitimacy is in dispute. Many sovereigns maintain it was with the ratification of the [LINKED_TEXT: 13th] [URL: https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiii] and [LINKED_TEXT: 14th Amendments] [URL: https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv]. According to Kalinowski, \\"Sovereign Citizens believe that the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, caused problems for the federal government because up until that point, 'slaves were not citizens of any state or country, because they were just property, and property did not have citizenship.' To rectify this problem, according to Sovereign Citizens, the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified so as to create 'a new class of citizenship.' This new citizenship was a 'privilege' granted by the federal government, unsupported by the 'sovereign inalienable right.' \\" ([LINKED_TEXT: Source] [URL: https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a30281693/sovereign-citizen-right-to-travel/]) Yes.

The sum of the first n positive integers can be calculated as follows: S = n * (n + 1) / 2 Where n is the number of positive integers you want to sum. In this case, n = 10, so the sum of the first 10 positive integers is: S = 10 * (10 + 1) / 2 = 55 So the answer is 55. This method is much faster than adding the numbers one by one, especially for larger values of n."},{"instruction":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","output":". Because Kannada people are more into science and Technology. The Kannada mindset and Kannada culture is highly influenced to go into medical sciences and Commerce rather than Movies or IT. It's like we are Bengalis of South when it comes to our interest in Bio sciences. Kannadigas are the Technology-Brains behind all Technological advancements in India. Starting from Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty form Kinnigoli to Alsuru Kiran Kumar of ISRO, Kannadigas are the science-brains behind every new advancement in India. Kannadigas are more into biology and technology rather than movies. Just because other South Indians are into movies doesn't mean we are any lesser than others. Movies are just a platform to show a culture. Agreed. But that doesn't mean movies only define your culture.

Behind every technological advancement in India, there will always be a Kannada person's brain. Do you know Kannada people have been the best bowlers for India? What about cricket? Let's talk about cricket — because Kannada people are fabulous in cricket. Remember Kannada people like Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Roger Binny, KL Rahul. Is there any other state that has produced such amazing cricketers? The answer is : only Karnataka The greatest ever Kannadiga cricket player must have been Gundappa Vishwanath. The truth is : Most Kannada people are into science and technology (mainly commerce and medical sciences). If you got in the field of medical surgery, many of the best surgeons are all Kannadigas. In sharp contrast, Many Tamils and Telugus are into IT sector. And since IT sector gets a lot of too much hype these Tamils and Telugus get noticed so much as if Kannadigas never really existed. Lol. Go into medical sciences: you will see Kannada people at the top rung. If the culture of Tamils and Telugus is defined by their so-called movies and IT industry, then culture of Kannadigas is defined by the Kannada brains behind every medical sciences advancements in India."},{"instruction":"Which is the most unbiased news outlet?","output":"NEW Update"},{"instruction":"Alfred Pennyworth a skilled fighter?","output":"AFAIK, in most iterations Alfred Pennyworth is a veteran of Her Majesty’s Secret Service(MI5, typically), Her Majesty’s Armed Forces(often Special Forces, such as the Special Air Services), or both.

I was a school nurse a few years ago, and one of the students came in just a couple weeks after school started (in September). She said she wanted a pregnancy test – so I said sure, and proceeded to ask her a few questions – when was her last period – if she has any other symptoms – she said no. She was about a week and 1/2 late and it was the beginning of the school so she was a little stressed out like everyone else. I did the test in front of her and it was negative. I explained to her that she is a little too early to test positive and she was welcome to come back in a few weeks or earlier if she wants to. We had buckets of these tests, and we paid so little for it so whoever wanted one we just did it. I told her next time she has sex she should be more careful. She blushed and she said it was a boy she worked with at a summer camp. She showed me his picture on her telephone and we agreed that he was quite cute. [addendum: I giggled and she said, “Isn’t he cute?” I said, “Yes, he is!”] So I said well I hope you're not pregnant because you could be carrying his baby. She said oh she should've thought about it but it tasted so weird. I repeated what she said – \\"tasted so weird?\\" There were simply having oral sex – she said he called it 69. I said yes that's when you do it with another person at the same time. And she said he ejaculated in her mouth and she spat it out. I looked at her and she was so serious. I said to her that in order for her to be pregnant, his penis had to be in her vagina and he had to really ejaculate in there. The girl was completely clueless. She said during high school, her mother did not allow her to take the health class because (they are) very strict Catholics. I was thinking that how sad it was for the girl to have grown up not knowing how things work. She had never seen a naked boy before. I gave her a booklet which pretty much explains everything. We spent a few minutes talking about it. (She was not very shy and the way I spoke to her it was a matter-of-factly.) Luckily she still was staying in touch with the boy and they are planning to see each other perhaps on the weekends (they happen to be from the same city.) I told her it probably was a good idea to introduce him to her family. He was going to another college nearby and they seem to be happy together. I had a hidden supply of condoms which amazingly was sanctioned by the school and I gave her a few and I told her he needed to use this in case he wants to have sex with her. I also made an appointment for her to see our nurse practitioner who came in the afternoon and she basically put her on birth control pills. (She was already 18 1/2 and was able to decide this on her own without her parents' consent.) [addendum: She said to the NP that she’s a good Catholic girl, and she can’t use BCP. The NP said to her (very kindly) that she can’t cherry pick the pages of the Bible to follow. She said, “Look, you’re going to do it anyway and you might as well do it safely.” and the girl agreed. I just shook my head when I thought about it after she left. I never laughed at her because it was not anything funny and it wasn't really her fault. A few weeks later, she brought him by to introduce him to me. We had a nice talk and he said he too, read that booklet, and he wanted to thank me. Her parents like him and I believe they remained a couple for a long time and were pretty much in love. I teased her (in front of him) and said, “Bring him around on the campus to show him off!” (This is a girls’ school.) Most people feel that abstinence is the best way – being a school nurse – I disagree completely. Let’s be completely honest here- they are going to do it anyway and the chance of getting pregnant is high if they don't know what's going on. Regardless of what you think about abortion - having to go through one is far worse (especially emotionally) than preventing the pregnancy in the first place. [Addendum: I have disabled further comments. There are some that were getting close to questioning my actions, or my judgment (as a nurse.) I must tell you that they were already giving each other oral sex, and nothing I might have said would have stopped them from fucking each other. No alcohol was involved (as both did not drink), but they were very good looking, and they were full of hormones. If I had said nothing, she’d be back in a few months carrying his child. So I did the best I could - do the test, and provide her with the condoms and got her seen by the NP that afternoon and she was put on the pills. Both were virgins and had never been with anyone else so there were no STD to worry about. The story ended well. They became a loving couple and her parents liked him. What more do you want from me? I had not thought about “me too” movement then because it didn’t apply to this case. The poor girl was naive, but she wasn’t going to let this boy force her into anything else and they really liked each other and there was no forced sex involved. The comments regarding “me too” movements made the writers look like they overreacted and it didn’t help your movement one bit. I consulted my boss and the NP and they both agreed with my assessments and actions. That was good enough for me and I don’t need the public’s approval. The school approved what we did although it’s a Catholic school because it’s better to put them on the pills/condoms and teach them to do it safely than having to deal with a girl wanting an abortion. To the woman who says her 14 nieces and nephews are so wonderful, you probably can’t imagine them masturbating. If you don’t like it, keep your children at home and don’t let them watch TV or go on the internet.]"},{"instruction":"Which regions of Texas were settled by people from Appalachia?","output":"I don’t know that people from Appalachia ever settled Texas in huge numbers though I’m sure some did.

Each warrior had unique strengths and achievements, making the decision complex. However, there are some prominent contenders for the title of the most powerful warrior: Bhishma: Bhishma was a central figure in the Mahabharata, known for his unmatched valor and impeccable skills in archery and combat. He was granted a boon of choosing the time of his death, making him nearly invincible until he chose to lay down his life. Bhishma's mastery in warfare and his unwavering commitment to righteousness earned him the title \\"Mahamaharathi\\" (the mightiest of warriors).Arjuna: Arjuna, the third Pandava prince, was an exceptional archer and a key figure in the Mahabharata. He received divine training and blessings from various gods, making him almost peerless in battle. Arjuna's skills with the bow, his knowledge of celestial weapons, and his unwavering dedication to Dharma (righteousness) made him a formidable opponent.Karna: Karna, the eldest Kaurava prince, was equally powerful and skilled as a warrior. He was known for his loyalty, charity, and bravery on the battlefield. Karna's mastery of archery was renowned, and he possessed a divine set of armor that made him nearly invulnerable. His martial abilities and his unyielding spirit made him one of the greatest warriors of his time.Dronacharya: Dronacharya, the royal teacher of the Kuru princes, was not only a great warrior but also a skilled strategist. He excelled in wielding various weapons and was a formidable force in battle. Dronacharya's teachings produced exceptional warriors like Arjuna and Karna.Krishna: While Krishna is renowned for his role as the charioteer and strategist for Arjuna, he is also considered an incarnation of the divine, possessing limitless power. Krishna's divine intervention, guidance, and blessings played a crucial role in shaping the outcomes of the war. In the epic, each warrior showcased remarkable might and prowess, and their achievements were influenced by various factors, including the circumstances of the battles, the divine blessings they received, and their adherence to Dharma. Ultimately, the Mahabharata demonstrates that power is not just physical strength but also includes wisdom, righteousness, and the divine blessings that shape the course of events in the epic narrative."},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"No, I’m a pacifist"},{"instruction":"What song has the lyrics someone left the cake out in the rain?","output":"MacArthur park, I like Waylon Jennings version best"},{"instruction":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","output":"It means, CAUTION.

The science-fiction trope is that the killer asteroid is spotted, 6 months from impact and everyone has to rush around to send nuclear weapons to destroy it. However, the truth is that nuclear weapons are a terrible solution to the problem - and if the asteroid is a large one - having just 6 month of notice is simply not enough. So “preparedness” isn’t about having fleets of spacecraft ready to launch at any moment. It’s really about having enough good telescopes to spot a “killer asteroid” decades before it’s going to be a problem. That gives time for considered thinking and planning on how to deflect (not destroy) it. The thing is - that if you can nudge the rock by even the smallest amount a decade or so before impact - that’s plenty good enough. If we had time, we might send a small exploratory probe to see what the composition and shape of the asteroid is - and then plan a deflection mission that might be a rocket that could push against it - or a “gravity tug” that would fly on a close parallel course and allow mutual gravity to slowly/gently change it’s course. That’s a good thing for loosely packed asteroids and asteroids made of ice and gravel. So - what we need is large telescopes - computers to find and track asteroids - and databases of known asteroids and their orbital components. Re-checking orbits of potential dangers. We also need a scale of “danger”. It turns out that we have ALL of those things - and right now, we can detect no large asteroids that are remotely likely to cause civilization-ending damage. The same cannot be said of much smaller rocks - but we’re getting better and better at spotting them. It has to be said though that a rock that could destroy an entire city could easily get through unnoticed until it was too late to deflect. In that case, we’d hope to have time to evacuate the city. But the odds of a city-killer actually hitting a city are pretty small - generally they land in deserted areas or in the ocean.

One has to invest time consciously and prudently to build relationships with alumni. It should be started early in their career. A conscious and focused effort can help one build their contacts and network over a period of time. Eg- Go for a trek or have a meetup with local alumni at your place on a weekend. · Be prudent about connections: It is also important to be prudent to choose with whom one may want to connect within given constraints. Eg- If your interests lie in technology and start-ups, it may not be worthwhile to be connected with someone who has interests in doing research on molecular biology unless it brings in different perspective. ·Be active: Be regular to attend college related events like annual alumni meets, batch reunions and any local chapter events and discussions. They are a good place to network with people and meet like minded people. It is also a good place to let people know about you. ·Improve visibility: Improve your visibility by not just attending events, but also by being an active volunteer for any of the events. Active participation in events or any discussions can help you improve your visibility. Eg- Why not take the initiative of starting fund raising campaign for your institute or start your own chapter in your city? ·Develop goodwill: Develop the attitude of giving first before seeking for help. If you can develop trust and goodwill, it shall reap benefits to you. Eg- Are you able to help someone when they are looking out for help in your city or when they are looking for expertise in areas where you are skilled? Sure, some day they have the gratitude to help you out when needed for what you have done earlier. ·Seek advice and guidance first: If you are looking for jobs or referrals, seek advice first as many people may be put off if you ask for jobs directly on the first go when you connect with them. Also, seek permission first before you directly ask someone to refer you for a job Eg- If you are planning to switch career or job to different place, seek advice on how to succeed and request if they can help you. ·Win-win: Do not exploit people but rather offer a win-win proposition while networking and when expecting help from your alumni. Eg- If you are looking for interns for your company, see how you can help them for their career progression and guide them in career. A win-win situation can help you foster your relations and get mutually benefited.

A trip to departmental store or groceries is easy as they have plenty of storage space. But mopeds have their limitations. The seating posture is not suitable for long rides compared to bikes. Secondly they are less fuel efficient than geared ones. Thirdly they are built for good roads, difficult to ride on poor roads due to their smaller tyre size. But it all depends on end user. Short ride to office, city roads then moped surely wins. On the other hand poor roads and long ride to work, geared ones win. One more thing for ladies, mopeds are best."},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"Vegetarian sources of protein Vegetarian sources include gram, pea, moong, lentils, urad, soybean, rajma, lobhiya(Indian food), wheat, maize. Meat, fish, poultry, milk, and liver are good carnivorous sources of protein. Soybean has the highest protein content in plant foods. It contains more than 40 percent protein. Boys in the age group of sixteen to eighteen, whose weight is 54 kg, require 4 grams of protein daily. Similarly, for girls of the same age group, whose weight is 50 kg, it is necessary to consume 43 grams of protein per day. For pregnant women, 43 grams, while for breastfeeding women (up to six months), it is necessary to consume 45 grams of protein per day. Vegetarian protein sources list Soybeans – Soybeans are more protein-rich than meats and eggs, in addition to protein, the soybean vitamin ‘B’ complex is rich in vitamin ‘E’ and minerals. Apart from this, soybean is also rich in fiber. 100 grams of soy chunks contain about 50 grams of protein.Paneer – All products made from milk are very beneficial for health, which helps in filling calcium deficiency in our body. Paneer is also prepared from milk and contains protein, carb, and fat. 100 grams of cheese have around 18 grams of protein.Moong dal – Moong dal is an inexpensive means of meeting protein deficiency because moong dal is rich in protein. About 24 grams of protein is found in just 100 grams of moong dal.Almonds – Almonds are rich in fat and rich in protein. About 21 grams of protein is found in 100 grams of almonds.

How can you simultaneously retain possession of Universalism heresy while also teaching the exact opposite in Vatican II and China?","output":"Catholic priests must not contradict solemnly defined Church teaching, but there are many theological areas where teaching is not defined. When a Pope expresses his personal opinion, we should respect it because of his office, but we don't have to agree with him. Catholics are not called to be zombies. For example, Benedict XVI, God rest him, loved plainchant and some classical music for the Liturgy, and was not keen on many modern hymns. However, for primary school children, I do personally think that it is good to use simpler, livelier hymns which they can learn and join in with. It's also good to introduce them to chant, but what an 80-year old Bavarian Cardinal likes isn't an iron rule for every congregation. That said, I played a Gregorian chant CD before Mass and during Holy Communion this Sunday morning. Nor need we agree with the Vatican's current Sino-Politik. It seems to benefit the Chinese Communist Party rather than faithful Chinese Catholics. When a Pope or bishop seems to be obfuscating or confusing definitive Catholic teaching, then faithful Catholics have a right, even a duty, to speak out. The laity often have more freedom in this, because the errant local bishop is unable to sanction them. As Newman pointed out, in the fourth-century Arian crisis, it was the laity who substantially kept the orthodox Catholic faith, along with Athanasius and Hilary etc, while many bishops wavered or compromised with Arianism. I'm not sure what the OP has in mind when he mentions universalism, V2 and China."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"In the Chicago based many IT Companies but I suggest some best in the world IT Companies: [LINKED_TEXT: AppClues Infotech] [URL: https://www.appcluesinfotech.com/] AppClues Infotech is a Trusted Mobile App Development Company knows how mobile apps play a vital role in improving your business to reach new heights.

Your monthly earnings from blogging can grow significantly in years 2 through 5. According to Glassdoor, the average salary for bloggers is more than 50,000 per year, based on information from multiple anonymous sources. Many of the successful bloggers I know make over 200,000 per year and work 10-30 hours a week. I mentioned earlier that I've posted my income report where I made over 400,000 with my blogging side hustle. There are a few ways to make money through blogging. Google Adsense EARNING POTENTIAL 0.1 - 0.5 per page view/mo If you are a new blogger, Google Adsense is the easiest way to monetize your blog. However, you won't make a lot of money from them. Even if you are getting a thousand visitors a month, you might make 50 at most with Google Adsense. But that's a start! I used Google Adsense for the first year that I was blogging, and then switched to an ad network to get a higher cpm (cost per thousand impressions) and cpc (cost per click). Advertising/Publisher Networks Potential monthly blog revenue: 20,000+ If your website has at least 25,000 page views per month, you can stop using Google Adsense and start working with an advertising network. Ad networks, also called publisher networks, will place ads on your website and manage them to make sure you're making the most money possible. Usually, these networks take 20-40% of the revenue from the ads on your website. You have the potential to earn more money by working with an advertiser/publishing network than by working directly with Google, even with a commission. Some bloggers make an astonishing 20,000 per month from display ads alone. You can search for ad networks specializing in your niche by simply Googling \\"[your niche] ad networks.\\" Some of these networks can be quite selective about who they work with, so you may need to contact a couple of them. Affiliate Ads EARNING POTENTIAL 5 - 500 per click/mo you can get 20-50+ for a confirmed sign-up If you place affiliate ads on your website, you can make a lot of money from them. In almost any niche, you can make money by recommending products or services and getting paid every time someone signs up through your link. This is because advertisers will pay more for a confirmed sign-up than a click. You could get paid 1-3 per click, but you could get 20-50+ for a confirmed sign-up. Amazon Affiliate Ads If you link to an Amazon product listing from your blog, you can earn a commission on the sale if one of your readers buys the product. Amazon doesn't pay as much per sale as some other companies, but their affiliate platform is very user-friendly. The commission you earn on a sale is dependent on the price of the product you promoted. Affiliate ads can be extremely profitable for bloggers who write about electronics, cameras, and other high-priced items. For example, if someone clicks on an affiliate link and buys a TV, the blogger could earn up to 200 from that transaction. In some cases, bloggers can earn up to 10% commission on sales. Over time, those commissions can really add up. Sponsored Content As your blog grows in popularity, more and more people will approach you with offers to pay to have their content featured on your site. This happens to me regularly, with about 100 people a week reaching out and asking if I'll publish their post on Millennial Money. These offers typically range from 50 to 1,000. You might think that it's a lot of money to pay someone to post on your blog, but be careful. Google doesn't like this practice and if they think you are posting a lot of paid content, they could blacklist your blog. This would be terrible and would take forever to recover from. Be careful about how often you post sponsored content because the quality of the content and links is often poor. If you link to poor quality content, Google will notice and so will your audience. Be choosy about which sponsored content posts you accept, or charge a higher fee and write them yourself. Since I started writing Millennial Money two years ago, I've only agreed to do four sponsored posts. I ended up rewriting all of them myself and charging more for them, because I wanted to make sure they were up to my standards. Also, I only agreed to sponsored posts that were directly related to ideas and services that I already promote. Your readers and Google's reputation should be your top priority, so don't bombard your website with sponsored content."},{"instruction":"Are democrats happy with the 2020 RNC Convention so far?","output":"Fact is if they are happy selecting Joe as their best candidate anything would make them happy.

Idiots that still think he’s a great guy, and cares about them, and continue to give him money, and still believe in him… That’s what makes him successful.

I have been in about three dozen countries (including five where English is the main language or has official status), and I have never seen a single watch or a clock with numbers written in the English language. But this is on Earth (the third one from the Sun); other planets may vary."},{"instruction":"Why are scientists more concerned about the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere than water vapor?","output":"Water vapour is condensable at the temperatures found in the lower atmosphere. When its concentration exceeds about 3% of the atmosphere near the surface, it condenses and rains out of the atmosphere. As temperatures lower with altitude, it is even easier to condense the water. As a result, the water vapour percentage falls steeply above about 3 km as it condenses and is below 0.04% of the atmosphere above about 5 km. If we try to increase the water vapour concentration, it just condenses and rains out, maintaining less than 3% of the atmospheric concentration. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, does not condense at temperatures and pressures found in our atmosphere. Since the atmosphere is well mixed to about 100 km, its concentration comprises about 0.04% of the atmosphere all the way from the surface to about 80 km. As we increase the amount of carbon dioxide, its concentration continues to increase since it does not condense. Since the total atmospheric concentration falls with altitude, the concentrations of water vapour and carbon dioxide fall as well. The difference is that the water vapour falls off with altitude much more rapidly. This, as explained below, makes carbon dioxide a much more potent greenhouse gas. Now both water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb strongly in the infrared near 15 microns. They absorb so strongly, in fact, that when they re-emit the energy it does not travel far before it is re-absorbed by another water vapour or carbon dioxide molecule. However, if that energy is re-emitted upward, it sees less water vapour and carbon dioxide (since their concentrations fall with height). Eventually the concentrations are so low that the re-absorbed energy can escape to space. However, for water vapour, the escape altitude is about 3 km, where the temperature is about -13 C, and for carbon dioxide it is about 7 km where the temperature is about -53 C. The Earth tries to radiate the excess energy from the Sun to space by emitting so called blackbody radiation. The wavelength at which this radiation has it strongest power is proportional to its temperature of the emitter, and the total rate at which it emits that energy is proportional to its temperature raised to the fourth power (T^4). As it turns out, the Earth is about 15 C on average, and radiates to space most strongly at about 15 microns—right where water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb. Now the water vapour re-emits that energy to space at -13 C or about 1.5 times more slowly than the Earth emits its energy. However, the CO2 re-emits that energy to space at -53 C, or about 3 times more slowly than the Earth. Thus, carbon dioxide blocks the cooling radiation to space much more effectively than water vapour. Since the rate of energy input from the Sun has to equal the rate of energy output to space to keep the temperature constant, reducing the rate energy is emitted to space in these absorption bands causes the Earth temperature to rise. It is just that carbon dioxide is better at doing this than water vapour, and because its concentration continues to increase as we add it to the atmosphere, it has a greater greenhouse effect."},{"instruction":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","output":"Most of us don’t get that lucky, to be able to bounce around to find our life’s purpose we are too busy, after moving out of our parents house, with all we own in our car then trying to make a stand in the world, to have a job we can pay our bills with then Mother Nature kicks in, and we get married and have kids then we are busy trying to pay our rent or mortgage, and other bills, and care for our kids.

Now, suppose that all English….…. were to leave India, , then who would be rulers of India? Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations — the Mahomedans and the Hindus — could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other and thrust it down. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable. At the same time you must remember that although the number of Mahomedans is less than that of the Hindus, and although they contain far fewer people who have received a high English education, yet they must not be thought insignificant or weak. Probably they would be by themselves enough to maintain their own position. But suppose they were not. [[38]] Then our Mussalman brothers, the Pathans, would come out as a swarm of locusts from their mountain valleys, and make rivers of blood to flow from their frontier in the north to the extreme end of Bengal. This thing — who, after the departure of the English, would be conquerors — would rest on the will of God. But until one nation had conquered the other and made it obedient, peace could not reign in the land. This conclusion is based on proofs so absolute that no one can deny it.

The law would immediately be challenged in court by conservatives, who enjoy a 5–4 majority on the Supreme Court. The Court would split 5–4 in favor of declaring it unconstitutional.

Let me break that down. At times when you choose something without being chosen, it puts you on a more offensive approach because you're being overly desire driven. We are all animals and it has been scientifically proven that some animals can smell certain scents. Desperation has a scent. It also manifests in a physiological reaction: sweat. Have you ever noticed how your body temp rises and you get sweat buildup and you can't seem to stop it? Well, that's what I'm referring to. That tends to happen when people are not sure about what's coming. Not being sure if someone likes you or how to get them to like you can do that. But, let me tell you one way to combat your frustration. I'd tell you to open yourself up to the various types of people out there. I know, you may like the eyes, nose, hair, muscles, brains, butt, voice, etc. There are so many variables that it can be comforting to simply find a small group of packaging that you appreciate. That way of thinking can lock into a bad habit of missing out on many wonderful types of partners that you could learn to like. Understand that this situation which is causing your disappointment is self imposed. You can create a new set of rules to update your view of your type. Trust me. Not everything that looks good to you is good for you. There are tons of people out there who've gotten what they thought wanted only to find themselves utter more disappointed with their newly acquired toy. People go and get new breast, butts, eyebrows, lips and any number of augmentations to appear more appealing to only find they end up without a partner or deeply disgusted with what they thought they wanted. There are too many stories in the naked city to support what I'm saying. Still, I know, you still want the big-muscled guy or the girl with the large butt and breasts or whatever combination. Happiness is only truly found within. No one person can deliver happiness to you. Sure there are things that can make you happy, but happy-NESS is already with you. But, let's say you want to settle for the superficial and get the temporary happy. Just know that what you pay for is what you get. There will come a time when that temporary happy runs out and you begin to question your decision. I broke things down, in this long-winded manner because I don't know your age and didn't know how much explanation you needed in one way or another. Plus, I'm a writer and words are my friends. I hope this started your mind to bubbling and gaining some valuable perspective on this important growth matter. Take care."},{"instruction":"What is dropshipping?

There are some elected members of the Republican Party who are genuine fiscal conservatives, but find that they do not have the support necessary in either party to enact actual spending restraint. Presidents Trump, Obama, and Bush II were/are not fiscal conservatives. All 3 Presidents loved to spend other peoples money. Republicans campaign on fiscal responsibility, but only very few like Rand Paul, Mark Meadows, and Thomas Massie believe in actually restraining or reducing federal spending. Constant fiscal profligacy, humongous government deficits, and government taking 20% of the productive economy wasn’t always the norm. This level of fiscal profligacy can directly be traced to policies and legislation that were adopted during the “progressive era” in American history. The primary culprits for this mess are Constitutional Amendments 16 and 17."},{"instruction":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","output":"Nihari Gosht, a classic Muslim dish that originated in Mughal royal kitchens, has become more famous around the world.

Answer: -Yes, a TP4056 board can recharge a 3000 mAh Lithium Ion Cell (1S Single Cell) without a problem as long as it is connected to an input supply of 5 Volts. However, an important point to note is that the TP4056 should have an output voltage of between 4.1 Volts and 4.2 Volts. The majority of the samples of TP4056 boards that I have tested with my multimeter show an output of 4.16 Volts which is optimum for the 1S Lithium Ion single cell. If the voltage is between this prescribed limit, then you can proceed to connect the cell for charging. One more important fact is that the TP4056 has a current limiting resistor that limits the charging current of the battery to anywhere between 950 milli-Amperes to 1 Ampere and therefore the 3000mAh battery will take at least 4 hours to recharge to 100% when the TP4056 is connected."},{"instruction":"What causes the lawn mower to smoke?","output":"depending if it is a 2 stroke or 4 stroke If it is a 2 stroke incorrect oil/ fuel ratio or incorrect oil used if it is a 4 stroke , can be worn riongs but more likely to be excessive oil in he sump generally that can be from a bad needle and seat that is allowing the fuel todrain into the sump raising the oil level top a point where the oil ring cannot control it Check the oil level and if it is too high , take it in for a carby rebuild also the wrong type of oil will make it smoke"},{"instruction":"Why did punk rock die?","output":"No rock is popular anymore.

People don’t realize that the can be the best in their field but if they don’t have traffic and convert clients you aren’t any better than the Indian writer pumping out crap content at 1 per 1000 words. So how do you get clients? I’ll share three easy ways to get started right away. 1)Join Job Boards Job boards get a ton of flack on this site but I can tell you they are a great place to start. Job boards are filled with people looking for work and if you choose the right one they make sure a client has put money in escrow for the project before you start (no more finishing a project and waiting months to get paid). One thing people don’t understand is that most clients have zero experience vetting, finding, paying, and hiring freelancers. Job boards make it easy for you to reach a large portion of the market. The competition is big but it isn’t that great. If you write each proposal (no templates) and deliver high quality results you will find work! Great places to start: Upwork Problogger Freelancer 2)Network on social forums and FB groups Freelancers who started in the business three years ago or earlier have zero experience with real networking. Networking is huge. Networking lets you create social proof in front of the right people and leverage that for later work and referrals. You can get started networking for free by joining groups that need your services on: *LinkedIn *FB groups *Genre specific forums If you happen to be a specialist find where the people in your field congregate and go there, be of value, collect information and cold email! 3)Guest Post On Authority Blogs and Publication This last tip is a longer play. Guest posts are great ways to increase your exposure. You can use them for: *Project links to work you have done *To put your name in front of new people *Increase your social proof Pro-Tip:Guest posting works like compound interest. At first you’ll have zero traction. As your career progresses and your articles published grows so will your interest. Example:I guest posted a year ago on Sean Ogle’s site. Two months ago I recieved an email from someone who read it. They loved my writing and wanted me to write similar articles for their site. Now I didn’t write for Sean for this purpose. I wanted to grow my audience and give back to Sean who has helped me so much. Remember, guest posting builds social proof. The more social proof you collect the greater your ability to book projects with clients will be later. Final Tip Join my mailing list. Every week I put out epic content that teaches you how to: *Write proposals so good they get you booked *Create powerful relationships with clients to secure lasting income and get epic referrals *Master the key skills you need to double your hourly rate *And more!

A couple of big differences make the instruments distinct animals. When you play a key on the piano, the key is weighted and triggers a hammer to strike a string. There’s a sustain pedal, which the player can use to lift the dampers off the strings and let the sound resonate longer, but it eventually fades. Depending on how hard you play the key, the hammer strikes the string with more or less force, causing the string to play different volumes. So a piano allows for completely independent control of dynamics with every note you play. When you play a key on the organ, on the other hand, it’s unweighted and triggers a tone generator. This tone will sustain indefinitely for as long as you hold down the key, but there is no sustain pedal - to sustain you have to use your fingers. And since each key you play is triggering the same tone generator at the same volume, there is no difference in dynamics regardless of how hard you hit the key. Volume is controlled by a volume pedal, and your other foot is busy with the pedal board below which provides bass notes. So while they look visually similar, piano and organ have very different strengths. The piano can be played lyrically and/or percussively at any moment, thanks to a sustain pedal any number of notes can be held at once, and a good pianist can control dynamics via individual fingers. The organ’s superpower is the ability to sustain indefinitely, change timbre via draw bars or stops, light touch and the ability to easily slide from key to key, and ability to play three different ranges at once with your two hands and a foot. For the most part people can only get very good at one of these instruments in a lifetime, but there are exceptions - see Larry Goldings and Cory Henry to name just two."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","output":"It is not possible to predict recession with certainty whether there will be a recession in the near future. Economic recessions are generally defined as a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for a prolonged period of time, and they are often characterized by high unemployment, reduced business activity, and declining asset prices. There are many factors that can influence the likelihood of a recession, including economic conditions, government policies, and global events. It is important to note that forecasting the future state of the economy is inherently uncertain, and even experts who study economic trends and patterns cannot predict with certainty whether or when a recession may occur. In general, it is always a good idea to be prepared for potential economic challenges and to have a plan in place to manage your finances and resources. This can help you to weather any potential economic downturns and to be in a better position to take advantage of opportunities when they arise."},{"instruction":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","output":"Honesty: Genuine people are honest in their words and actions.

They treat everyone with dignity and kindness."},{"instruction":"Where is the best place to get help with credit card debt?","output":"Benefits of Debt Settlement Over Options There are a few debt relief options you can choose from - paying on your own, credit counseling, debt consolidation, debt settlement, and bankruptcy. Each option has their own pros and cons, but if you're leaning toward debt settlement, you may like what this solution has to offer. With debt settlement, your monthly payment is based on what you're able to pay. Payments under most of the other debt relief options are based on what your creditors will you to pay and they'll only go so low. If you're simply unable to make those minimum payments, debt settlement may be a better option since what you contribute toward your settlement payment is based on your budget. Note that some settlement companies want to settle your debt in a certain amount of time, so that may mean your monthly payments are set based on that time period. You can settle debts even if you're past due. As a matter of fact, your debts have to be delinquent before most creditors will accept a settlement offer. On the other hand, your accounts have to be current to go into a credit counseling agency's debt management plan. While you can consolidate past due debts, it may be hard to qualify for a low interest rate debt consolidation loan if you have negative payment history on your credit history. You'll save thousands of dollars on interest by settling your debts because you're settling your debts in just a few years, instead of paying on them for decades. If you were making the minimum payments on your debt, you could pay more than double your debt in interest alone. In settlement, you shave off all those years that you'd otherwise be paying interest. In addition, you would settle any interest that had already accumulated on your account. You can settle debts on your own or you can hire a debt settlement company, you choose based on what you're comfortable with. Other solutions require you to include a third-party - the credit counseling agency, a lender, or the bankruptcy court. Settling your own debts lets you avoid the middleman and avoid fees you pay to the debt settlement company. On the other hand, if you're not comfortable settling with creditors, you can hire a debt settlement company. It's great to have the freedom to choose. Debt settlement gives you a little breathing room, mainly because you've made a conscious decision to stop paying your creditors and instead focus on coming up with enough money to pay off a lump-sum portion of your balance. Once you decide to settle your debts, you can stop worrying about what you're going to do and instead start doing it. You don't have to worry about the impact to your credit, because, by choosing debt settlement, you've acknowledged that your credit takes a backseat for a few years until you've gotten the debt out of the way. Debt settlement has gotten a bad reputation from unscrupulous companies who took advantage of debtors. Fortunately, new federal law has almost eliminated these companies, making the benefits of debt settlement a lot more apparent.

First and foremost, it's crucial to understand the odds and the probability of winning. A successful bettor doesn't simply rely on luck; they have a thorough understanding of the sport they're betting on, including the team or athlete's past performance, injuries, and other factors that may affect the outcome. It's also important to set realistic expectations and manage your bankroll effectively. This means only betting a percentage of your total funds on any given bet, so as not to risk losing everything in one go. It's also helpful to track your bets and review your performance over time to identify areas for improvement and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you need help with your sports betting strategy, there are many resources available. Consider consulting with a professional handicapper or utilizing a sports betting platform like [COMPANY NAME] to access expert analysis, real-time odds, and other valuable tools to help you make informed bets and increase your chances of success.

Him : Take her at night for extra dramatic effect. me : I'm going to, yessssss…. him : yessssss. we both : lets talk about infinity war like we always do… (That’s our attention span.

So weekend came and on a rainy Sunday evening as the clock strikes 8. I picked her up from her flat and took her to the nearest pvr. On the way over she asked me if she can hold my hand? As a guy grew up on bollywood. i said “Why not?” so movie started and as well the jump scares begans. for some reason i didn’t found the movie as scary but the girl grabbed my hand and in my head i went like ‘here we go'. After few minutes i felt excrutiating pain in my left hand. The girl has nails sharper than chain saw. Although they were pretty all painted in black nail polish complementing her fair hands. But chain saw none of the less. ok here’s a thought i want to kill the person who said ‘men don’t feel pain'. i was literally shitting balls.

Don’t lose perspective This is tough there. When you enter Exeter, there’s a lot of kids who aspire to go to Harvard, MIT, Yale, Princeton, etc. Chances are, not all your friends are going to get into these schools, and sometimes people will think UC Berkley, UVirginia, or UMichigan, which are amazing university by anyone’s standards, are “the second tier” after Exeter. Try not to get into that mindset. You have gotten into one of the hardest high schools in the U.S., and keep that in mind when you are there. You’re at a school where there are a lot of people of high caliber and different interests, and at a place that you don’t get lectured but you learn yourself. THAT is probably one of the largest gifts there. Being in my second year of University, I miss that a lot. 2.) Be open about yourself You’re going to be with different people, some you may like, some you may not. Your parents are far away from you. Your grades will drop compared to before. Some friends are better at speaking/writing/debating/math/all compared to you. You're not the best anymore. And that’s fine, but don’t let that frustration bottle inside of you. You may read some Russian novels, and feel sad with each other, but it’s okay opening up to your friends about things that you don’t usually talk about or feelings that you consider trivial. Your thoughts matter, and when you find those who listen AND want to genuinely help you, that will be the best way to find a true friend. 3.) Have a growth mindset. Only compare yourself to your previous self. Nothing more than this. People will try to compare against you or you will have tendencies to compare yourself against other guys/gals who may have better writing skills, better looks, or more beautiful significant others than you. Heck, I never had a girlfriend until I was 20! You will feel pressured to do many different things, ranging from joining clubs to activities that will get you kicked out, and the best thing you can do is to compare yourself to your previous day and see if you have improved. Some of the smartest people had a fixed mindset, who everyone looked up to, yet whenever I talked to them I could tell that they were super insecure and anxious about being at the top. This is since they have a fixed mindset that they were always smart, were always gifted, so needed to do something to maintain an edge. That isn’t growing, but relying on previous gifts that have nothing to do with you. Good luck, and if there are any Exonians or future Exonians curious, I would highly recommend you keep this in your mind while you study there for the next 4, 3, 2, 1 year(s)."},{"instruction":"Why is Prince Andrew 'vocal' with the Queen that Charles 'shouldn't be King'?","output":"I imagine there is some jealousy.

A well-made one is hard to find in India, so if the Rosetta Stone is spotted, it is inevitable that there’s going to be moss and cheese around my lips and on my shirt. Pringles sour cream and onion flavoured crisps I attack a cylinder of Pringles stack-by-stack and each stack includes 7–10 crisps, so civilization is impossible in the air around me while I grind those to oblivion. Spinach and ricotta cannelloni The consequences are a bit similar to those pertaining to calzone attacks. The last time I binged on cannelloni was when I roomed with family at Clarks Avadh in Lucknow for a few days in 2018. I included daily breakfast and dinner as part of the booking, and my blood sugar levels were close to 700 (699) at the end at least as a result of cannellonis being part of all (buffet) meals. The common link to all of these is gluttony, the most innocent of all the SDS, so the possibility of converting any contact with civilized food into an Obelix and a wild boar event is significant enough. When I was a kid, snacks wouldn’t last even an hour after my father’s arrival with a box of any of them. Once my father took his young children to his friend’s abode in a hill station — beautiful Attakatti near Coimbatore. The friend served us coffee (probably Bournvita for the kids; I was about five years old and my brother seven then) and brought two large plates of mixture to be snacked on (by all!) between sips of coffee. My brother and I assigned ourselves a plate each and proceeded to empty everything on it. The friend was tottering on the edge of ruin. My father used to say that my brother and I were born with funnels in our mouths.

I got to the door and the man in question took the pizza (took it from me but was not handed it) claimed the pizzas were being comped by the manager. As per company policy in any situation where things don't seem right I called my manager to confirm this and he said this was untrue, and that the address had been difficult in the past. I relayed this to the customer who then proceeded to take the phone from my hands and begin speaking in hushed tones I could not quite make out. What I didn't know was that he was threatening to not return my phone or even let me leave unless the pizza was given free. In situations like this it was common (although pretty foolish in hindsight but that's managerial decision-making for you) in our shop to send out other drivers to assist the one in trouble, usually either those who are nearby or, if there are none, the biggest and meanest looking ones in the store and this is what happened. Along with this the police were notified as one would expect. Through some careful diplomacy I managed to convince the man to return my phone so I could speak to my manager and after he did I hear one word from the speaker: “run”. Apparently the customer had a history of violent behaviour we were unaware of. Being a slender, quick-footed person and a good if speedy driver I managed to get out okay before help had arrived (they were called off before they could be in danger). Easily one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of the last few years. So long story short pizza delivery shops, at least where I live in Scotland, will initially try to talk sense into the person and if this seems unlikely to work they will immediately treat it like any other theft and report it whilst simultaneously prepare against the worst and get the deliverer the hell out of there. The address and phone number will then be permanently blacklisted If someone is willing to casually break one law you can't simply assume they won't break others. They may not but it's not worth the risk for a £10 pizza."},{"instruction":"Who is headless CMS for?","output":"Until recently, developing an integrated website was sufficient as a content delivery tool. But nowadays the variety of modern gadgets has changed the number of interaction channels between customers and companies. Each of these channels needs to be addressed differently, both from a technical and content point of view. Therefore, digital companies are beginning to realize that the concept of traditional content management systems is no longer so relevant. That’s because a traditional CMS turned out to be too limiting in the new multichannel world. The constraints that have arisen and the need for a more engaging digital experience across all touchpoints, like websites, mobile apps, smart devices, have prompted organizations to invent a better alternative - a headless CMS. Do I need a headless CMS? The answer to this question is quite simple, but it won’t help you much: It depends on your requirements. The term headless means that the “head” (the frontend of your application) becomes decoupled from the body (the backend). Unlike traditional content management systems, a headless CMS is only concerned with storing data. It exposes this data to the outside world, usually via an API, which introduces many great benefits, for example: Device versatilityTechnological flexibilityGreat content management experienceImproved security You can learn more in our article: [LINKED_TEXT: Headless CMS: The Benefits of Being \\"Headless\\" - Unikorns] [URL: https://www.unikorns.work/magazine/headless-cms-the-benefits-of-being-headless]"},{"instruction":"What are some ways I can attach both large and small vertical cardboard tubes to flat horizontal platforms when constructing a homemade multilevel cat tree?","output":"I would consider atttaching round wood components to the base first.

And what is the definition of a person? As for the philosophic question of when a human being can be considered a person or lose their personhood, the application is very fuzzy and arbitrary. By the same standards we might deny personhood to an embryo we would remove personhood from a human who is sleeping, unconscious, in a coma, in a vegetative state… of no functional use to society.

In some circumstances it can be better to lease than buy. Some leases can improve your credit rating. So this means you will pay less per month, while building your credit. Yes you pay for the car's depreciation, but your credit should improve allowing you to buy a car at the end of the lease with a lower interest rate. This can also be helpful with some unexpected life events where you need a newer/bigger/etc. car that you weren't able to plan ahead for. It allows you a car to use, while getting you used to paying for a car, and making sure you have a dependable car until your life/finances level out. I have known several people that have leased for the credit boosting or life changes reasons. They entered into it knowing that it may not be the ideal option, but it was the best option for them and their situation at the time. You need to assess why you are leasing, and look at the costs vs. buying. Then decide what makes the most sense to you and for your lifestyle/income."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"When it comes to meal prep, sometimes you simply want convenience. That's why microwave meals are so popular. Now, you may realize that some microwave meals are unhealthy options but do you realize that even microwave meals that claim to be healthy can be bad for your health? It's true! Here's what you need to know about microwave meals and how they can have a negative impact on your health. Blood Pressure Issues That microwave meal that advertises it's low in calories? Well, that information is not telling the whole story. Many microwave meals may be low in the calories department but high in things that aren't good for you, such as salt. Too much salt, as well as other preservatives, can have a negative impact on your blood pressure and lead to problems with your cardiovascular system down the road. Most people need about 2,400 mg of sodium each day to stay healthy. If you're getting more than that, then it's time to rethink what you're eating. Water Retention Another issue that you can experience if you eat too many microwave meals too frequently is water retention. The salt contained in the meals will actually make you less thirsty and have an impact on your water intake. That's because the retention of fluid tricks your body into thinking it has enough water -- when it really doesn't. Not drinking enough water each day can have a huge impact on your overall health and wellness. Beware of Food Poisoning Microwaving is usually a safe way to prepare foods, but food still needs to be cooked to a certain temperature in order to make it safe for consumption. Microwaves tend to unevenly heat food and may not get it to the temperature required on the box. If it doesn't, then that can put you at risk for food poisoning. Unhealthy Body Weight Convenience foods often found in the microwave meal section of the grocery store are not known for helping you to achieve or maintain a healthy body weight. Eating prepared and processed foods, such as microwave meals, can pack on pounds. So, beware of foods from the microwave -- even if the packaging makes them sound healthy. If it's prepackaged and processed, It's not doing your health any favors."},{"instruction":"f you had one wish from a genie in a bottle, what would it be?","output":"What would be your one wish if a genie came out of a bottle? “I wish that any cockroaches that come within 1km of me would immediately die and stay dead.” No selfish want of money or power, no altruistic crap like world peace or empathy.

Set in a real courthouse, Jury Duty incorporates workplace comedy into a real crime documentary that’s actually a hidden camera show. The series Jury Duty focuses on the civilian Ronald Gladden, surrounded by incredible up-and-coming actors and famous faces such as James Marsden (Dead to Me). It depicts an unsuspecting jury immersed in a fictitious case. An arguably impressively ambitious concept, Jury Duty succeeded almost entirely thanks to Gladden’s earnestness.

The Diplomat (2023) Keri Russell (“The Americans”) stars in “The Diplomat,” a hard-hitting political thriller that follows the life of the new U.S. ambassador to Britain. “The Diplomat” deftly marries the personal and the political, with an eight-episode first season that piles on tension and enthralls Russell as Kate Wyler. While The Diplomat is sometimes overshadowed by political issues, its equally interesting when Kate confronts demanding husband, her fellow diplomat and up-and-coming political star played by Rufus Sewell.

US gun owners believe that gun regulations when targeted at persons who are a threat such as psychotic individuals and violent criminals are a good thing. Especially, when they are actually enforced. Most gun regulations target nonviolent and non-psychotic individuals. They target law abiding people who use firearms to protect their life, family and property 2 million time per year. The California and federal laws failed to protect the citizens of Sacramento this past weekend. During that event at least one fully automatic weapon was used. (Based on Audio) If the weapon is ever recovered It will probably have been smuggled into the US. Probably through Mexico. Dandrae Martin the first person arrested in the Sacramento Ca shooting has a long history of criminal conduct. He under current law is prohibited from possessing a firearm. His convictions include false imprisonment, assault, (involved sex trafficking) drug dealing (felony). and parole violations for a number of other convictions. Yet he is being charged for possession of an illegal weapon. Note that he is not charged for violation of being a prohibited person in possession. He is the poster child for the person whom gunowners believe should be prevented from having firearms. He is also an example of lax enforcement of existing firearms law. In locations where violent criminals are targeted for weapons violations and receive long sentences in prison (See operation Exile-Richmond VA) Violence declines. Murders drop.

When implemented effectively, social media marketing can have a positive impact on your brand, customer engagement, lead generation, and overall business growth. Here are some ways social media marketing can benefit your business: 1. Increased Brand Awareness: Social media platforms have billions of active users, providing an opportunity to expose your brand to a vast audience. Regularly posting engaging content and interacting with users can significantly increase your brand's visibility and recognition. 2. Improved Customer Engagement: Social media allows direct communication with your audience. Engaging with customers through comments, messages, and posts helps build stronger relationships, fosters loyalty, and creates a sense of community around your brand. 3. Targeted Advertising: Social media platforms offer sophisticated targeting options to reach specific demographics, interests, behaviors, and locations. This allows you to focus your marketing efforts on the most relevant audience, increasing the chances of conversion. 4. Lead Generation: Social media can be a powerful tool for lead generation. By providing valuable content and using lead generation forms or landing pages, you can capture user information and turn social media followers into potential customers. 5. Website Traffic: Sharing links to your website or blog on social media can drive traffic to your online assets. The more relevant and engaging your content, the more likely users are to visit your website and explore your offerings. 6. Brand Authority and Thought Leadership: Consistently sharing valuable and insightful content can establish your brand as an authority and thought leader in your industry. This helps build trust with your audience and positions your business as a credible source. 7. Customer Feedback and Market Research: Social media provides a platform for customers to give feedback, share opinions, and voice concerns. This real-time feedback can be invaluable for understanding customer needs and preferences, helping you improve products and services. 8. Competitive Advantage: Having an active and engaging presence on social media can give you a competitive edge. Businesses that effectively leverage social media are more likely to attract customers and outperform competitors who neglect their online presence. 9.

Measurable Results: Social media platforms provide detailed analytics and insights, allowing you to measure the performance of your campaigns and make data-driven decisions for future strategies.

So while Johnny Rotten was slumming around London with a ““I hate Pink Floyd” shirt, Pink Floyd’s records were selling by millions while punk bands seemed to take pride in the fact that they were basically destitute, and unpopular. While punk was mostly known in the UK, it was even more underground in the USA. No major chain record store carried the records, and radio AirPlay was non existent. Often times our punk collection was mostly cassette copies that had been traded around, it didn’t bother us that we would never hear ““Holiday In Cambodia” on the radio, or that we couldn’t find The Germs at the local Tower Records, because it was cool to have something underground that left your Foreigner loving friends shaking there heads in disbelief that I would listen to such garbage, but before long they would be listening too.

Is this true?","output":"Hahaha, no. Your conservative relative is misinformed. While there are certainly good reasons to not like Hillary Clinton, the risk that she’d foist socialism upon the country isn’t one of them. Even if she could as president (she can’t, no president can), she wouldn’t. Clinton’s track record isn’t that of a socialist of any stripe. Instead, she’s proven herself pliant and friendly to corporate interests, all for bailing out banks and keeping them deregulated, for trade agreements that put corporate interests ahead of sovereignty or the public good. (It’s better-explained here: [[LINKED_TEXT: Bernie Sanders Vs Hillary Clinton: Comparing Neoliberalism To Democratic Socialism On Issues] [URL: http://www.inquisitr.com/3174833/bernie-sanders-vs-hillary-clinton-comparing-neoliberalism-to-democratic-socialism-on-issues/]]) For context, socialism is a spectrum of political/economic organization, which ranges all the way from state-ownership-of-industry to we’re-still-capitalists-but-regulate-markets-in-the-public-interest. Clinton lands somewhere well off the spectrum, way over in neoliberal-corporatist-land, where instead of wanting government to check corporate abuse, they see the proper role of government in service of big business (or apparently, in service of folks who can afford high-powered lobbyists). For all that conservatives are constantly assured that democrats like Clinton (and Obama, for that matter) are secret socialists, that’s just propaganda to keep them riled up. The truth is a bit worse; establishment Democrats since the Reagan era have been of the same neoliberal stripe; they might be liberal on social policy (like women’s rights and marriage equality) but in economic terms they’ve internalized as correct the sense that the government’s role should be to strengthen corporate hands in terms of suppressing organized labor, keeping wages low, exploiting foreign labor and resources, and outsourcing public functions (like prisons and schools and warfare) to private interests. In this sense, Clinton might as well be a Republican- they like all the same things, in terms of economics, corporate welfare, trade policy, and keeping bank regulators toothless. But they’re going to stoke up the socialism propaganda to keep your attention focused on that stuff. This is all kinda fascinating to watch, in the sense that so much of America’s success is so closely related to where it’s cultivated public wealth, assets, infrastructure, and safety nets. Part of America’s success is connected to such socialist undertakings as Social Security, Medicare, Interstates (gasp, freeways instead of tollways?), ports, the military, your fire department, police, and all the other common infra/services that enable so much more. To watch us use Socialism like a political boogeyman when we use so much of it (as though we didn’t) is at least a little entertaining."},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"9 Good Protein Source for vegetarians to avoid Protein Deficiency Food and drink should be taken special care to stay healthy.

She was the best flying of all fifty Blackbirds and just loved to fly fast. While assigned to Site II at Palmdale for flight test, test pilot Bill Weaver and his back seater took it 974 out for a test run after some major work was completed. Having completed their test card, and with ample fuel on board, Bill radioed back to Site II to ask permission to run the SR out to the end of its performance envelope. On this particular test run, the weather and temperature at 80,000 feet was perfect; 974 was the best flying of all the Blackbirds and Bill received the okay to run her out. At Mach 3.43, or just around 2,400 mph, 974 had a duel unstart. Both Bill and his back seater thought the SR was in the process of disintegrating around them. Bill indicated that he thought his back seater may have messed his shorts. That didn’t happen, and they were able to recover 974 and to bring her home, a little shaken, but other wise okay. Hope that answers your question. And SR-71A, 974 was okay to fly the next day.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"A lot of the answer is: it depends on the vet. Also, you, as the caretaker of the cat, are the only one who can really make this decision. The hardest call to make, in my opinion, is to decide to put down a cat who is not actively sick, but whose quality of life has deteriorated. Here are some things to consider: Has the cat's quality of life deteriorated? Will the cat need care that you can't, or can't afford to, provide? Does the cat need treatment that will be painful, and will the cat understand why it's suffering? (Probably not…cats can't understand how something like chemotherapy feels bad, but will ultimately help.) Can the cat be cured? How old is the cat? Is the cat happy, or is it miserable? Could the cat be rehomed?"},{"instruction":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","output":"I was always out of opinion for this topic. I heard people say it creates pollution and should be banned, I thought oh yes it does we must not fire the crackers. Then there were arguments saying people fire crackers in marriages and in cricket wins and on many other occasions other than Diwali. I thought oh yes it must be permanently banned for everyone. Somewhere I heard, there are so many factories and vehicles and gadgets that creates so much pollution, Crackers are insignificant in front of the pollution they create on a daily basis. I thought yeah that’s correct, we must not target only crackers for pollution. And there were many more, some in favor and some against. Then yesterday, I read something said by Sadhguru “Concern about air pollution is not a reason to prevent kids from experiencing the joy of firecrackers. As your sacrifice for them, walk to your office for three days. Let them have the fun of bursting crackers.” And I said oh yeah that is so good. I felt happy for this middle way to enjoy bursting crackers. None of the above written stuff convinced me fully to have my own opinion. It is Diwali today. I went upstairs to see the lightning all around my place, and what I saw was nothing but smog all around. White dusty air. I came back in exactly 3 minutes. and now as I am writing this answer, I can feel something is wrong with my throat. and this happened in exactly 3 minutes. This somehow gave me an opinion of my own. It is less about bursting crackers on Diwali, or on other occasion, but more about the quantity in which they are burst in one go. So many people are out there defending crackers by comparing them saying they create less pollution than factories and vehicles and all other stuff. Many people are there who fight with others to not burst crackers, but then there are so many people ( most of them young kids or youngsters) for whom Diwali has no meaning other than enjoying crackers. So the question remains where it was, should we burst crackers or not? My answer is- If you enjoy bursting crackers, go ahead and have fun without feeling guilty. If you do not like crackers or if you have learnt other ways to enjoy Diwali which does not include crackers, that is best. Enjoy Diwali your way to the fullest, without making anyone feel guilty about bursting crackers. Let us not forget Diwali is a FESTIVAL which is meant to enjoy. Let us also not forget that we live in nature which is already polluted and crackers create pollution(noise and air both). Let us find a middle ground just like Sadhguru suggested. Instead of mocking the practice of bursting crackers and those who burst crackers, let us do our bit to reduce pollution in our daily lives so that when we burst crackers it is little less harmful. Instead of saying no to crackers, let us teach kids about what crackers do to environment and how does the noise of crackers bother animals. If kids know about the side effects, they may choose willingly not to burst crackers and find other ways to enjoy Diwali (This worked for me and my brother, we did not understood pollution when we were little, but when we got to know about animals, we completely stopped crackers). Instead of taking the ban of crackers on religion or on Diwali, let us look at our environment and think mindfully and maybe burst little less crackers if we can’t stop totally. let us do our part in every little way we can and not fight for a straight answer of yes and no. since my throat is not feeling good, I am stopping here.

You could pick a public key with much higher hamming weight, but why would you - all it would do is make the maths harder. It also means signature verification is cheaper than signature creation. Symmetric keys take the same effort for encryption and decryption. In counter mode the operation is in fact identical. In Diffie Hellman operations are equivalent. So in El-Gamal and Integrated Encryption schemes, encryption and decryption are equivalent. In Elliptic Curve schemes the private key operation (signature) is cheaper than the public key operation (verification) but we tend to use ECDH to set up an IES so again operations are equivalent."},{"instruction":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","output":"Understand the reason behind your son's interest in music: Before trying to stop your son from making music, it's important to understand why he enjoys it.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","output":"The NHS runs routine screening for some cancers- cervical, colon, prostate and breast cancer from memory. People considered at sufficient risk from these will be invited for relevant checks on a regular basis - how often that is depends on the cancer being screened for, and risk factors. So a woman with a strong family history of breast cancer will start getting screened earlier, and more often than one with no family history of it. If you have no symptoms or other cause for concern, a NHS GP is unlikely to arrange for checks that serve no real purpose. But if a man has family history etc that suggest a strong risk of prostate cancer, a GP would probably deem that sufficient cause to do a simple PSA test earlier than normal, if the patient asks. The simpler, quicker and cheaper the test, the more likely a GP is to agree to it with little justification."},{"instruction":"Which is the best position to sit in for studying?","output":"Definitely ergonomic chairs are better than wooden and plastic chairs. But for buying ergonomic chairs there are many brands. After searching many websites i found “FEATHERLITE” chairs which is the best branded company for chairs and furniture's. A few important feature of chairs for studying longer duration are… Height must be adjustable, so that we can sit at convenient height at the table.Leaning tension on back support must be adjustable. Also the height of hand rests must be adjustable.The most important feature of chairs for studying longer duration is “The back support should be straight i.e., the angle between back support and chair should be 90°”. So the chairs which have back support way too back and the chairs like in barber shop should never be used for studying.Also one more important thing to keep in mind when buying table and chair for studying is to ensure that the minimum height of the chair upto handrest should be less than the height of the table studying area. There are many types of chairs in FEATHERLITE, but i brought “Featherlite Contact Project High Back Desk Arm Chair (Black)” which was quite amazing. There are better chairs available in this brand than this one, but those weren't deliverable to my location so i brought this. Initially I thought the back support wasn't sturdy but after watching demo video on YouTube i found it was sturdy and it actually was sturdy. Price might be a little high but rather buying chair's at low prices of cheap quality which are going to eventually get damaged buying this type of best branded company chairs is better.

They were often referred to as Cafsa or Capsians; a group of people not devoid of negroid characteristics according to Jehan Desanges a French historian, philologist and epigrapher, a specialist of North Africa during Antiquity. A member of the [LINKED_TEXT: Institute for Advanced Study] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study] in [LINKED_TEXT: Princeton] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton,_New_Jersey][1](11) Wyatt MacGaffey, Professor of Anthropology, Haverford College, Pennsylvania claims that the term “Mediterranean” is an anthropological euphemism for “Negro”. B.B. Lal (Braj Basi Lal, better known as B. B. Lal, is an Indian archaeologist. He was the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1968 to 1972 and has served as Director of the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla.)has shown conclusively that the Dravidians (original east Indians); (southern India), came from Nubia and were related to the C-Group people who founded the Kerma dynasty.(3) The Sudanese Dravidians / Ethiopian Indians Africa extended into what is now called India. The Dravidians or original peoples sometimes referred to as Dalits are Ethiopians / Africans. The term Dalits means Bound and the name may have been given to them by those who enslaved them and put them in a racist caste system at the lowest levels. the Dalits or Dravidians were the indigenous peoples of India or the Eastern Ethiopians or Eastern Africans. \\"The distinction between the black-skinned Sudroid races of southern India and the fair-skinned Aryan races of northern India is not an invention of English colonialist historians; it is a feature mentioned by the earliest Greek travelers who visited south Asia centuries before the advent of Robert Clive. The ancient Greeks considered the Africans and Sudras (modern Dalits and Dravidians) as belonging to the same \`Ethiopian' stock. \`Ethiopian' was the Greek word for \`Negro', and Greek authors referred to the African Negroes as \`Western Ethiopians' and to the Sudroids as \`Eastern Ethiopians' (ie. Eastern Negroes) [ cf. [LINKED_TEXT: http://Herodotus.VI] [URL: http://herodotus.vi/].70 ]the majority Witness the following citation from Herodotus - \\" The Eastern Ethiopians, [ ie. Sudras ] differed in nothing from the other Ethiopians, same in their language, and the character of their hair. For the Eastern Ethiopians have straight hair, while they of Libya are more woolly-haired than any other people in the world. \\" Beyond the gulf of Baraca is that of Barygaza and the coast of the country of Ariaca, which is the beginning of the Kingdom of Nambanus and of all India. \\"That part of it lying inland and adjoining Scythia is called Abiria, but the coast is called Syrastrene. It is a fertile country, yielding wheat and rice and sesame oil and clarified butter, cotton and the Indian cloths made there from, of the coarser sorts. Very many cattle are pastured there, and the men are of great stature and black in color. The metropolis of this country is Minnagara, from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza. In these places there remain even to the present time signs of the expedition of Alexander, such as ancient shrines, walls of forts and great wells. The sailing course along this coast, from Barbaricum to the promontory called Papica opposite Barygaza, and before Astacampra, is of three thousand stadia. \\"Periplus.41 The Makran was referred to by the Greeks as \`Gedrosia', ie. the land of the black people. Black Sudroids form a sizeable portion of the population in this region to this day, and formed one of the groups referred to as \`East Ethiopians' [ Kondratov, p.145 ]. Indeed, several geographers considered India merely another extension of Ethiopia or Abyssinia -India as a whole originates from the north, embraces all the area which is Persian, and continues as far as Egypt and the lands of Ethiopia. \\" The Caste system was instituted by the ruling Aryan class that invaded India. Here are some comments on that history: \\"The Dravidians entered India before the Aryans, before 2000 B.C., after passing through Mesopotamia, Iran, and Baluchistan where the Brahuis, a Dravidian race, still live. On grounds of cultural affinities such as inheritance through women, snake cults, organization of society, and structure of temples, some historians connect the Dravidians with the Elamites and Mesopotamians. The evidence of Indian skulls from the Indus Valley indicates that the Mediterranean stock became established in north India before the Harappab Civilization came into existence around 2000 B.C.\\" \\"Of particular significance is archeologist B. B. Lal's contention that the Dravidians probably came from Nubia, Upper Egypt. This theory would give them among other things their Mediterranean features and dark complexion. Lal writes: \\"At Timos the Indian team dug up several megalithic sites of ancient Nubians which bear an uncanny resemblance to the cemeteries of early Dravidians which are found all over Western India from Kathiawar to Cape Comorin. The intriguing similarity extends from the subterranean structure found near them. Even the earthenware ring-stands used by the Dravidians and Nubians to hold pots were identical.\\" According to Lal, the Nubian megaliths date from around 1000 B.C.\\" \\"Distorted Race Theory\\" The term \\"distorted race theory\\" in application to the Dravidian movement, which is compared to Nazism and Hindutva. The latest genetic research, which conclusively proves that the Dravidians and Dalits belong to the same Negroid stock. The poisonous casteism, which the Indian iconoclasts suffering from, is entirely Aryan and Brahmanic origin. Historians have conclusively established that caste did not exist in the pre-Aryan age. It was introduced by racist color-conscious Aryan invaders who wished to \\"maintain their racial purity\\" from \\"contamination\\" with native Dravidians. During the Harappan Golden Age, that the Dravidians and Dalits existed as one people, known as \`Sudras'. The division between Dravidians and Adi-Dravidians is purely artificial and the result of Aryan invasions, with the former choosing to adopting Aryan culture and submit as slaves to the Aryans and the latter battling the savage Aryans, retaining their freedom in the jungles. Adi-Dravida means - \`Original Dravidian'. Dravida is of Sanskrit origin and the term \`Sudra' and \`Adi-Sudra' are now more in vogue for this very reason. The word \`Sudra' is attested from the Vedic Dark Ages, and this word is of African origin, whilst the terms \`Dravida' and \`Dalit' are much later innovations. The following diagram shows how the Dravidian word \`Sudra' is in fact derived from \`Sudan' : Sudan --> Sudra (Central Africa) (Black Indian Caste) Sanskrit The word 'Hindu' has its origin in Sanskrit literature. In the Rig Veda, India was referred to as the country of'Sapta Sindhu', i.e. the country of seven great rivers. The word 'Sindhu' refers to rivers and sea and not merely to the specific river called the Sindhu (Indus), now in Pakistan. In Vedic Sanskrit, according to ancient dictionaries, 'sa' was pronounced as 'ha'. Thus 'Sapta Sindhu' was pronounced as 'Hapta Hindu'; similarly 'Saraswati' was pronounced as 'Haravyati' or 'Harahwati'. This is how the word 'Hindu' came into being. The ancient Persians also referred to India as 'Hapta Hind', as recorded in their ancient classic 'Bern Riyadh'. That is why some scholars came to believe that the word 'Hindu' had its origin in Persia. The Greeks who invaded India under Alexander the Great, dropped the 'H' completely and used the name Indoos or Indus which later led to the formation of the word 'India'."},{"instruction":"w do snow plows know where the edge of the road is and not run off?","output":"The easy and most accurate answer is “experience”. Experience helps the driver learn the details of his plow route. He or she may not know exactly where he is along the road, but he probably will recognize features along the route. Trees, rocks, mailboxes, signs, houses etc. They drive this route once every two to three hours while plowing in a snowstorm. You can walk from your bedroom to the kitchen with your eyes closed. Our drivers have a pretty good idea where they are on their 8 to 15-mile plow route. Some drivers are lucky enough to have delineators along the edge of the highway, likely about 4 feet off the edge of the pavement. They are usually placed along the both sides of Interstates and other major highways. Fun fact: In NH, the roadside delineators, which are 4” x 6” silver reflectors set 4 feet above the edge of pavement, are placed 20 per mile, or one every 256 feet. [5280/20=-20. Sometimes all a driver can do is try to see the next reflector through the snow or fog. Part B of the question is where the plow is laterally (left and right) driving along the road. Again, experience. They can sometimes see or sense if they are too far to one side or the other. If it is daylight, they might see a piece of paint centerline in their mirror. Maybe there are embankments near the road, or mailboxes, utility poles or fences that will keep them on the road. Runs of guardrail are an obvious target. They may not know exactly where they are, but they usually have a pretty good idea."},{"instruction":"Abe Lincoln was a self taught lawyer.

Get a book out to read, start storytime for the dolls. If young Miss is hanging about to enjoy the story, close the book and remind her that storytime is for those that have brushed teeth and changed into pajamas. Reassure her that you will hold storytime a few minutes if she should like to get ready.Ask the children if there is a volunteer to unload the dishwasher, wait.

Inoculations are Not Just for Physical Diseases: Sometime shortly before age 10, sooner for some, sit them down for a short talk about how things will change for them in the next few years. Not that whole weird puberty talk that makes everyone just a little uncomfortable, but a quick rundown of how the very way they think of events will change. They will know that all of the rules you give them are because you don't want them to have friends, because you're trying to ruin their lives, and because you hate them. They will know that nobody else in history has ever felt as intensely as they do about… whatever it is… and adults couldn't possibly understand. Let them know that this is a perfectly normal way to feel, but it is wrong; the teen brain simply lies about what it experiences.Let them know that they may be at a party someday and have a chance to try some alcohol. They may decide that it feels good, and their brain will tell them that more alcohol will mean more fun… Sometimes, your brain lies to you.

The founders were arrested and tried in Sweden, not the U.S. (But they did help investigate, rumors suggest.) But you say “websites like the Pirate Bay”. The internet is a bunch of physical cables and servers. In order to actually get data from a server, your computer has to go through these to reach fixed locations that have the data you want to download. You can obfuscate your end as a torrent user quite a bit, weaving a path through countless gimmicks, like VPNs. But the actual data store has to have a fixed and known digital location. And by asking the owners of the infrastructure the routing they used to get to a fixed IP address, it is possible to physically trace back to the location of the piracy website. It does require warrants to get that information from internet backbone companies and ISPs. And that final line from the ISP’s box to the actual location of the servers is controlled by the server owner, so can be another step in obfuscation. But one foiled by a technician just walking the cable line to your facility.

If you are the owner of the mobile phone number, you can usually access your own call history by going into your phone's settings or calling your mobile carrier's customer service line. The exact process for accessing your call history may vary depending on your phone and carrier, so it's best to check with your carrier's customer service for instructions. If you are trying to access the call history of someone else's mobile phone number, it becomes more complicated. In most cases, you would need a court order or a warrant to access someone else's call history. It is illegal to access someone else's call history without their permission or without a legal justification. It's also worth noting that some mobile carriers may not keep call records for an extended period of time, so the availability of call history records may vary depending on the carrier and the timeframe you are looking for.

Not even a little bit. Remember the Facebook phone? No? Well they made a phone. Because they thought people would buy it. Spoiler: they didn’t. People hate Facebook. They use it because they have to. They use it because they’re used to it and it exists. They don't want to let Facebook more into their lives. Plus Facebook makes crappy hardware. Like terrible. Horrible. The Occulus is an exception but they bought that. No, they’re not going to give the Apple Watch a run for it’s money. They won’t even give the minuscule other smartwatches that barely succeed a run for their money. The Meta Watch will flop like a lead balloon that someone threw a baseball through (see video). Facebook’s Meta might succeed. I give it less than even odds, especially considering how much everyone hates Facebook, but of all their products that will definitely not succeed, this will be one of them. If the Facebook Meta Watch ever comes even close to meeting Apple’s Apple Watch numbers, I’ll shave my eyebrows. It’s like asking if Nokia made a car if it would give Tesla a run for its money.

If these conditions are fulfilled in every point of an interval [a,b], then f is continuous over that interval. Then, one can build using continuous functions. If f and g are continuous over [a,b], the so are f+g, f-g, fg, f/g (when g is not zero), and f(g) (composition) over that interval. For instance, y = sin(x^2)+ln(x) is continuous over its domain x>0 because x^2, ln(x), and sin(x) are. A very useful theorem using derivatives: If f is differentiable over [a,b], then it is continuous there. I.e., if f ‘(x) exists at every point in [a,b], then f is continuous there. For instance, since d tan(x)/dx = (sec(x))^2, which exists over (-pi/2 , pi/2), then y = tan(x) is continuous there."},{"instruction":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","output":"I just thought of an online business: most cities have less than 40 skyscrapers.

Is this true?","output":"I don’t know what the “Hidden Bible Code” is that you referenced, but I do know what God’s word says, and in speaking of the rapture, Jesus said in Matthew 24:36- “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” There is more to it than that, but the rapture is always described as a “surprise” event. Jesus comes as a “thief in the night” in 1 Thes. 5:2, and although we are also told in that same chapter that we are not “in the dark” and will not be “caught unaware”, we can’t know the day or the hour. Could he have revealed the “year” of the rapture in His word? Of course He could have! The year is not the day or the hour, and He revealed the very day that Christ would enter Jerusalem at Passover in Daniel 9, so, again, of course He could. God knows the end from the beginning so anything is possible. But, again, I don’t know anything about the book so I can’t vouch for it. So, is the rapture in 2021? Personally, I think there is an outstanding chance that it is because we can see the shadow of many of the tribulation judgments looming over us now, and none of the prophecies from Revelation can be fulfilled until after the rapture of the church so…it’s looking good! I’m ready to fly in the twinkling of an eye, so whenever that trumpet sounds I’m good to go! How bout you? There is so much more to Bible prophecy than most even know so I hope you don’t mind but I’m going to link a question below that I received about “Nostradamus” that I answered with Bible prophecies alone. It explains the connection between the “end day” prophecies of Daniel and the “70th week of Daniel” and the prophecies of Revelation 6–18, or the “tribulation” which is one and the same 7 year timeframe. It reveals the specific prophecy that, when fulfilled, will reveal the identity of the Biblical Antichrist, trigger the start of the tribulation, and give those who are still here on earth the ability to calculate the exact day of the Second Coming of Christ. Understanding the Daniel-Revelation connection really helps us to understand the placement of the puzzle pieces of Bible prophecy. The linked question/answer has 3 more answers linked to the bottom of it, so between the 4 there is a lot of information on Bible prophecy, and one answer that focuses on Biblical salvation. One answer proves that although it is not the “end of the world” as some are fearing, it is the “end of the world as we know it” as we are incredibly close to the remainder of prophecy being fulfilled. The third gives Scriptural evidence that the rapture precedes the tribulation and that those who have repented of their sins and turned to Christ and Christ alone for the forgiveness of their sins and for salvation can count on soon being removed from the earth in the “twinkling of an eye” whether they’re “ready or not!” I think the accurate teaching of the rapture is so scarce in the church that the majority of Christians will be shocked and pleasantly surprised to find themselves in the clouds with Christ in the near future despite the fact that they knew very little about Bible prophecy. Fortunately for the church, the only requirement for us to be taken in the rapture is that we are born again. Bible knowledge and prophecy knowledge are not requirements. The rapture is imminent, so for that reason and more, [because none of us knows if we have tomorrow], I plead with those who do not yet know the Lord to repent and give their lives to the Lord now! Please, please do not wait, because although people can still give their lives to the Lord after the rapture, and during the tribulation they will then pay for their newfound faith with their very lives, as persecution and then martyrdom of Christians will become global during the tribulation. I hope you’ll read my linked answers and will consider all that God’s word has to say about the days that are soon coming [if you don’t know already.] The clock is ticking…again…so please don’t wait.

It is the process of hiring, firing, training, and motivating employees in a business. 1. Employee data storage: Without wasting time on paperwork, HR representatives can easily process employee information on the system, and the ERP software system is an efficient way to store and recall employee data as needed. HRMS aids in the efficient, safe, and secure storage of all of this system’s data so that it can be retrieved for administrative purposes. GwayERP HRMs automate time-consuming paperwork and other employee record-keeping tasks such as employment history, education qualification, compensation and benefits, and personal identification proof. 2. Recruitment management: GwayERP manual hiring and onboarding is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process that necessitates a large number of man-hours that could be spent on more productive activities. It is simple, user-friendly software that automates various aspects of recruiting, such as sourcing, screening, documentation, and onboarding, to drastically reduce human effort and time spent on hiring. Can quickly screen resumes and online applications to identify the best candidates and manage a pool of ideal candidates for future job openings. 3. Attendance and time management: HRMS provides a reliable attendance tracking system (ATS) to the company. This amazing feature enables HR professionals or managers to keep track of an employee’s attendance and absences. It makes the requests easier to process for both parties. Managers can use this integrated attendance system to quickly access the leaves database to determine an employee’s total available leaves and approve or reject the request based on availability. This system is also accessible to employees, making the process more transparent. Employees can thus learn the reasons for the approval or rejection of attendance or leave requests. 4. Accelerates the organization’s effectiveness: Unlike traditional tools, HRM software does not require much human effort. Because HRM’s systems are fully automated, they can handle time-consuming and manual tasks on their own. You only need to issue commands, and the software will handle the rest. From data management to hiring. HRMS expedite all operations. It increases transparency and employee engagement within the company. With the help of various functions such as employee evaluation and disciplinary tracking. This is demonstrated by the company’s effective management of its employees and resources, which results in the company’s growth and expansion. 5. Eliminating human errors: One of the most significant benefits of an HRM is the elimination of human errors. Most payroll management and filing tasks can be automated with GwayERP HRMs, which not only saves time but also eliminates common errors such as incorrect salary calculations, double credits, missed deductions, and so on. Another major source of unnecessary business costs is human error. HR task automation reduces the likelihood of common errors such as double entries and allows employees to double-check their work for any possible type. 6. Cost-effective: HRM software enables organizations to manage all human resource tasks in a single system, lowering the costs associated with correcting human errors and the budget required to handle an organization’s workforce performance. As a result, HRMs are a cost-effective solution regardless of the size of the business. Replace time-consuming data entry tasks with automated technology to save your company money. Apart from initial cost savings, automation eliminates the need for paper by digitizing all processes. Companies, such as payroll, demand that an employee monitor and track the attendance and leave processes. Businesses can go digital and use HRMS to automate mundane managerial tasks instead of hiring people to manage these processes. 7. Enhance employee self-service: Employees frequently have a wide range of questions and concerns, and they expect detailed and immediate responses. When a company has hundreds of employees, it is frequently impossible for the HR team to respond to every employee's query. A good HRM system can provide better self-service options to employees. All they have to do is enter the policies and other data into the integrated system. Employees can also log in to their accounts and look up any information they need without bothering the HR department. This continuous flow of information increases workplace transparency and efficiency. 8. Training management: This feature of GwayERP [LINKED_TEXT: custom erp software] [URL: https://gwayerp.com/] monitors and reports on employee instructor-led training programs and courses. It manages training programs, grading, records, history, and schedules. 9. Payroll: A payroll is a collection of employees whose wages are processed regularly. Payroll errors can be a company’s undoing, so payroll must be carefully managed. An HRM can calculate paychecks, control the pay schedule, and ensure accuracy. Payroll has a large impact on an employee’s relationship with their employer. An integrated HRM software application with your payroll software can improve efficiency. It collects data for attendance, net pay calculation, salary distribution, tax filing, and other purposes."},{"instruction":"f Republicans are supposedly fiscally responsible, why does the deficit increase every time they are in power?","output":"There’s a difference between “supposedly fiscally responsible” and “fiscally responsible”.

Yes, I am an atheist who is pro-choice, but I used to be a Christian so hear me out. Only God can make Godly laws. Humans all fall short of God, and therefor any law we make will fall short of Godliness. Yes, I know that you all think abortion is murder, but it was not seen that way in the Bible UNLESS the baby was viable outside of the womb. Otherwise it was not that big of a deal. Any Christians who tell you differently are flat out lying to you. They will twist every verse they can to prove their point, but they will also steer clear of those that actually do deal with it. Also, regardless of what religious people think, the United States is a secular nation, and has always been a secular nation. It is an earthly nation. To force your views onto others is not Godly either. If you believe in the Bible then you have to believe that God gave unto people the gift of free will. They have free will to believe in him or not. No where in the Bible does God justify those who follow Christ taking away the free will of others. It only tells you to not act as the non-believers do.

(1) In 2010 the IMF lent Euro 30 billion to Greece as part of a much larger package to support the ailing economy. The IMF explained at the time that it had lent 3200% of quota, well over its normal limits for a country in difficulty. It gave Greece “exceptional access to IMF resources”. The IMF cited the need to prevent the crisis spreading to other parts of the EU and to defend the Euro. In 2012 the IMF decided to lend Greece a new Euro 28bn as part of a replacement loan package. It drew attention this time to a “significant large competitiveness gap” (stronger language than 2010) and to a high level of public debt. This time it agreed with a major write down of privately held Greek public sector debt (75% written off) and required cuts in the minimum wage as part of its measures to improve competitiveness. Once again Greece received special treatment with a large loan. I queried why the IMF would do this for a country which is no longer sovereign in monetary and economic matters, as its status with the Euro prevents a normal IMF recovery package. (2) The International Monetary Fund says Greece missed a 1.8 billion debt payment Tuesday, becoming the first developed country to default on a loan to the lending agency.Eurozone finance chiefs refused to grant a last-minute extension of the bailout program Greece has relied on for five years, and the Greek government couldn't come up with money on its own to pay the IMF. The IMF said its executive board would consider a Greek request to extend the loan. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called a referendum Sunday in which Greek voters can decide whether to approve a deal proposed by the country's creditors. A \\"No\\" vote would likely force Greece to stop using the euro currency. The last country to miss an IMF loan payment was Zimbabwe in 2001. (3) The IMF has been charging an effective interest rate of 3.6% on its loans to Greece. This is far more than the interest rate the institution needs to meet all its costs, currently around 0.9%. If this was the actual interest rate Greece had been paying the IMF since 2010, it would have spent €2.5 billion less on payments.Out of its lending to all countries in debt crisis between 2010 and 2014 the IMF has made a total profit of €8.4 billion, over a quarter of which is effectively from Greece. All of this money has been added to the Fund’s reserves, which now total €19 billion. These reserves would be used to meet the costs from a country defaulting on repayments. Greece’s total debt to the IMF is currently €24 billion.

Think about it for a second. Over the course of your business with these customers, you’ve provided them with a service they’re happy with, and have in many cases made their lives easier by fixing a problem they used to have. But above all, you’ve built a relationship with them, and that’s a powerful thing. For you to be a successful business, you need to cultivate the relationships you already have and offer incentives to get them coming back to you again and again. Why waste time and effort chasing down new clients, when you can turn your existing ones into repeat customers? How to Incentivize Your Customers to Come Back to You Again and Again Once you’ve realised that your most valuable assets are your current customers, it’s time to start [LINKED_TEXT: incentivising those customers] [URL: https://www.fieldpulse.com/academy/incentives-loyalty-service-business] to come back to your business again and again.

Your past customers would probably jump at the opportunity to re-experience the joy of having their lives improved through your work. But without incentives, most people are going to lack the nudge they need to make another booking. By creating incentives you can re-engage your past customers, improve their lives, and make them loyal to your brand for life. Stay In Touch In today’s digital age, staying in touch with customers doesn’t need to be difficult. Emails can be used to say thank you (like on anniversary dates, birthdays, or other special occasions), promote a service or product when you want to increase sales, to stay in touch with relevant updates from your field, collect customer feedback, and much more. With almost unlimited uses, email should be a regular part of your customer communications.

Share seasonal updates that prompt them to call you (like checking your A/C before summer or checking for leaks before it starts freezing). Reward Loyalty Once you have re-engaged your past customers with a new offer or by reaching out to them for their feedback, it’s time to start rewarding them for their loyalty and lock their business in for a lifetime.

What I wish to address is the concept of ‘scope of understanding’. For an example, we, as a people, don’t bitch and moan when taxes are withheld from our paychecks anywhere NEAR what we would do if we were required to simply write the Gum’ment a check on the 15th for the exact same amount. Leaving aside that most of us couldn’t cover said check, when we saw exactly how much the esteemed electorate of our country was siphoning off of our lifestyles things would get, well, ugly. They certainly did for France. And China. And Russia. And the budding US. Venezuela, suit up; you’re on in five. People would go berserk, our elected leaders would likely end up swinging from a tree, and a whole BUNCH of our stupid policies and decisions would get corrected. Likewise, back in the ‘80s, there was some sort of scandal involving the Congressional bank; I believe word got leaked that Congress folk did NOT have to pay a fee if they bounced a check. No matter HOW big. And it appeared that they did it a LOT. Now, the average joe can’t comprehend giving away 60 blujillion dollars to ‘Krudfukistan’…but they CAN understand, fully, what a bounced check fee is. And how merciless the banks could be concerning these fees-which were hitting people that (obviously) couldn’t afford it. But our leaders did NOT have to deal with the same issue, and could write as many checks as they wanted while the rest of us ended getting crucified. And if I remember correctly, the country went nutz. Both sides were howling for some heads. Our elected leaders-for the first time in near recall-became aware that they had just about pissed off the whole country. And that their careers (“My job is to keep my job!”) had just gone into extreme jeopardy from a totally unplanned occurrence. They scrambled QUICKLY to get the bounced check fees reinstated (although I believe the system lets them dispute a bounced check fee with an almost 100% success rate, as long as they do it in writing). Quietly, of course. Likewise, people don’t hate Voldemort for being a mass killer-we just don’t really get that. But-BY GOD!-we DO understand the petty miseries that a pencil-pushing bully like Deloras Umbridge represents. Every last one of us has to deal with that crap on a reoccurring basis, so we understand it fully. So, the long and the short is people don’t understand-or comprehend-giving DuPont or ConEd or whoever some big tax break for XXX (heh) dollars, mainly because it’s not like anyone actually wrote a check. But they DO understand loans, and what happens if a payment is missed. So people don't’ like the fact that someone else may be getting off of the hook…even if it’s a hook that appears to have been created, supported, and sanctioned by the exact government that is trying to back track on the issue now. Kinda like how they backtracked on the bounced check fees. The real answer here appears to be that no one wants anyone else going over the student loan program too closely-if we did, we’d see unreasonable rates, non-existent requirements for applications, absolutely no oversight, exemption from bankruptcy declarations ( no one ELSE gets this) and I suspect that our senators have a hand in the same companies that administer these loans. In short, our politburo (both sides) is the group that sanctioned this-they threw a bunch of people just getting their start in life under the bus. Sure, some partied, but not all. It should be noted that college tuitions skyrocketed about the same time that all of this money became available, making it even harder for someone who didn't have access to cash attend. o much for higher learning institution… It is my sincere wish that right, left, and middle sides grab our leaders by the throats and start shaking until we get some answers. But we are not going to do that until we get past the ‘Forgive the loans/Make the Bastards Pay” debacle. As long as we are at each other’s throats we’re are not going after theirs.

Living there, the village turned off the water a couple of times to do work on the sewage system, and my crazy neighbors would call the landlord to DEMAND that the water be turned back on and/or DEMAND that they be given a rent adjustment! Sure it was an annoyance, but there wasn’t a thing the landlord could do about it. They complained about everything. They broke a window and demanded that the landlord fix it. I can tell you that if I accidentally broke a window I’d consider it my responsibility to fix the darn thing! 2nd time was upstate New York, Delaware County 1990. After the first year, I was informed that my rent was being lowered by 25. Again, my neighbors were awful people that would pretty much trash a place and then complain that the landlord wouldn’t fix it. They complained about pretty much everything. When I moved out my neighbors informed me that I would never get my deposit back; that he never, ever returned the deposit. I was nervous! I needed that deposit because I had borrowed the deposit on my next apartment. To make matters worse, I wasn’t able to connect with his agent for a walk through and had to just drop off the keys in her mailbox. A week or so later a check arrived in the mail. For a little more than my original deposit. I called to tell him he sent me too much. He informed me that the law says that I get my deposit back plus 3% interest, less any damages/cleaning required. And since I’d left it move-in ready, I got it all plus. I cleaned, mopped, painted, cleaned the stove, oven, fridge. The only thing I didn’t finish was the back wall of the closet and I guess he figured that was good enough. And I didn’t leave my garbage behind. Turns out when you respect your landlords right to get his money on time every month and your own responsibility to return rented property in the same condition that you received said property, it’s worth it! I honestly don’t know how landlords do it. I don’t know how they ever actually make money, considering the poor condition most tenants leave behind. I did some cleaning for someone that owned rental properties and I was astounded at what so-called civilized people would do to property not their own. More than once I thought a place had been abandoned for a long period and occupied by squatters and the owner was just getting it ready for a first time rental. Turned out that it had just been vacated by a legal renter very recently! It looked like they had food fights in that place!"},{"instruction":"Which rock band has had the most messed up/dysfunctional history?","output":"Probably the Rolling Stones, sex, drugs, death of their founder & general nastiness all in the name of rock n roll."},{"instruction":"Why are Tempurpedic beds so expensive?","output":"We tend to spend a third of our day on a mattress, so opting for the right one is an essential decision.

We will always try to at the very least to understand where others are coming from. This is why we are so confusing to many. We can contradict ourselves in conversation simply because it is very hard for us to not see all sides. This s even true when we are speaking of our views. It will go something like this.

Companies will post a job, perhaps on a few different sites. Then job robots will repost the job over more sites. Then many companies no longer remove a posting after the Job is filled because it takes so long to find qualified people and even if they do the robot re-posters will be slow to age off the job posting. All of this added together gives the impression that there are 10 times as many job openings as there are. But there is another problem. Companies, particularly those hiring through HR departments or headhunters, hire via laundry list of skills. Rarely are tools and skill requirements the same for two different companies. Typically a qualified candidate may match 50% of the skills advertised and have no experience with the other half. This causes HR departments or managers to reject the candidate until a match comes along or, more likely, they are desperate for help. For each critical skill the time needed to find a candidate increases exponentially. So jobs often stay on the wire for a year or more when prime candidates are available. This results in a opening backlog an order of magnitude larger than it should be."},{"instruction":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

Suppose we looked through one of our most powerful telescopes toward the “edge” of the observable universe. We might see one or more very distant galaxies 13+ billion light years away from us. We see their red-shifted light and calculate their distance and speed of recession from us. Now suppose that on a planet in one of those distant galaxies is some being looking at us through his powerful telescope. If our galaxy is younger than his by even only a few million years, our light will not have reached him yet, and he will not “see” us. We will appear dark to him, but the effects of the gravity we generate may be visible to him on older light-emitting objects in our neighborhood perturbed by our gravity. He might even be tempted to name us something he calls dark matter. I realize this is a vast oversimplification of all the potential mechanisms involved in such a scenario, but is there a theory such as this to explain one possible source of what we currently call dark matter?"},{"instruction":"Which of the following numbers doesn't belong: 64, 16, 36, 32, 8, 4?","output":"36 because it has prime factors other than 2 aslo. whereas, 64 = 2×2×2×2×2×2 = 2^6 16= 2×2×2×2 = 2^4 32= 2×2×2×2×2 = 2^5 8 = 2×2×2 = 2^3 4 = 2×2 = 2^2"},{"instruction":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","output":"Any type of cigarette paper is terrific for cleaning pads on woodwinds.

It must be grounded on some concept of “the same”. Standardly, we use what I call the Traditional Theory of Identity (TTI), which says that a=b iff they partake all properties (not just some). Identity means numerical identity. And, furthermore, according to TTI there are no substrata, no haecceities, nothing more than properties. Classical logic and standard mathematics, say that one which can be developed in a set theory such as ZFC, encompass TTI in some way. Leibniz holds: there are no indistinguishable but (numerically) identical things. So, when the ship had one of its planks exchanged by another one, it became another ship. This is logic, as far as we accept it. So, strictly speaking, we are changing ourselves in each instant of time: we are perdurants. But, if you prefer to say that the ship remains the same, you must present us your theory of identity. And I anticipate: it will be a theory of something different, for identity tout court means numerical identity. Relative identity, vague identity, whatever adjective you may use, are related concepts, but not numerical identity."},{"instruction":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer’s patient that they’re vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they’re in a care facility—assuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","output":"My aunt was blind and forgetting things when she turned 80.

A war torn country, a failed state is what most of us think of this place but in reality, all of this, our perception is built around what has happen in the last 15 years which is true. A great injustice is people don't know how many times Iraq and especially Baghdad have have been wiped out just to make way for a greater state. what is happening now, Iraq has seen numerous times before. it has seen grater oppression and has seen its sovereignty violated it has experienced its rivers run red with the blood of fallen martyrs. like its mystical past almost ironic Iraq will surly rise from the rubble and heal its wounds of war like its has done for the past 5000 years. To understand the fabric of this region one needs to go back before america, before Saddam, before the mongols and even Islam. The history of Iraq begins ever since the start of human civilisation thus earning it the title of 'the cradle of civilisation' numerous times this area has experienced periods of utopia from the pre-historic ubaid period when this area advanced in architecture innovating new tools and methods of agriculture only to be conquered by the priest king of umma being destroyed only to make a way for a more civilised and advanced society, throughout the bronze, iron and middle ages this would be a repeating process where Iraq would reach a pinnacle of development only to be conquered and the process being repeated. On the advent of Islam, Iraq experienced the greatest tragedy in Islamic history it is without doubt the event of karbala when mentioned even today brings anger and sorrow in eyes of millions of Muslims around the world.Where members of the prophet Muhammad's (sallahualayhiwassalm) family including his grandson were killed, small children martyred resulting in widespread chaos and war. after the situation normalised the Islamic world was experiencing peace, the lands ruled by Muslims stretched from Spain in the west to India in the east. Every field of science was being dominated by Muslim scholars, astronomy, physics, geography biology, major breakthroughs and medical equipment being manufactured, a scientific revolution, a golden age was overcoming Islam and Iraq would be at the centre of it all. Being situated on the ancient silk road a road connecting china with the west already made Iraq's position and economy very strong amongst the ancient city the paper industry of Baghdad was a an international market trading paper from buyers t seller from around the world. . Science, technology and poetry would transform Baghdad in to a true middle age metropolis and would remain so for the next 500 years. having a population of over one million and also being one of the fist city's in the world to be master planned . Artists and intellectuals from all around the world would come to Baghdad from the bazaars to the court of the king the talk of the day would be regarding the branches of science and knowledge. translators would be paid the weight of the book in gold if they translated from ancient Greek in to Arabic. Europe was going through its dark ages so the intellectuals of Baghdad rushed to preserve these manuscripts. the caliph at the time established a library calling it 'bayt ul hikmat' or 'the house of wisdom' housing millions of manuscripts. As destiny would have it the Mongolians under the leadership of hulagu khan invaded Iraq as they had heard of its riches and beauty. not caring for the manuscripts that had consumed so many resources to accumulate indiscriminately killing whoever trod there path.books thrown in to the river and the library burnt, what had taken centuries to accomplish had taken just under a week to be reduced to rubble. As we come forward after the Ottoman rule the British would implement there own choice of ruler and as a voice from the people against the administration grew, the baath party managed to gain power whilst its leader would be Saddam Hussein. Under Saddam, Iraq would become a fairly wealthy country being a close ally of the U.S Iraq developed problems with Iran, pressure from the U.S resulted in Iraq and Iran going to war leading to economic downturn after 9/11 america decided it would remove Saddam as he was accused of using chemical weapons again Kurds and possessing \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" . 2003 was when the war began and 2006 was when Saddam was convicted and hanged. after the deaths of 1.2 million Iraqis infrastructure ruined and no sense of safety america and its allys withdrew leaving a vacuum of power left for anyone one with a some power to overtake since then we have seen a constant shift of territory being controlled by I.S.I.S., rebels and whats left of the administration. It has been almost 15 years since the fall of Saddam and the destruction of Iraq many people have been left thinking will the situation ever become normal? like how it used to be? Analysing the past and the history of Iraq we can say for certain a day will come where once again the people of Iraq will be safe and free. innovation and engineering new ideas and methods like they have done for the past five thousand years. read more at my in my blog: [LINKED_TEXT: Iraq | An untold story] [URL: https://makpaktube.blogspot.com/2017/09/iraq-untold-story.html]"},{"instruction":"When did Humayun sit on the throne of Delhi for the first time?","output":"Akbar was the third Mughal emperor.

I mean it’s still pretty arty. But less traumatized and disoriented. I had to sort out how to say things visually again. My Instagram name is Flipping _The_Narrative. One reason for that is that it’s the visual flip side of my written record keeping.

It is forever changing, but nearly always rooted in the blues. It has a rich tradition and its own rules, but it is brand new every night. It is about just making a living, and taking terrible risks.

While some may find chubby cheeks endearing, others long for sharp features such as a chiseled jawline, sharp nose, and sculpted cheekbones. For those who desire a slimmer face, facial fat and double chin can be challenging to get rid of. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore various methods and strategies to help you learn how to lose facial fat effectively and achieve that flattering, sharp facial appearance. 1. Practice Cardio Exercise If losing weight and achieving a more svelte figure is your goal, then cardio exercise—a type of aerobic activity—is a prime contender to include in your fitness routine. But did you know that such exercise can also contribute towards facial slimming? Alongside its well established benefits for shedding total body fat and reducing midriff circumference while promoting an increase in lean body mass (i.e. spare body mass) cardiovascular workouts could also help you slim down where it matters most to you: the face! To reap maximum benefits from this powerful form of exercise its important to commit to moderate to vigorous sessions lasting at least 150–300 minutes every week. And with an array of popular cardio activities—including running, dancing, walking, biking and swimming—to choose from there’s no shortage of enjoyable ways to achieve your fitness goals. 2. Perform Facial Exercises Facial exercises may help strengthen and tone facial muscles, potentially reducing facial fat. Despite no direct scientific research investigating whether there’s any correlation between exercising certain muscles in the face with shedding fat from this area specifically some clues indicate that incorporating particular workouts may boost overall muscle tone throughout this region. An example could be expelling air back-and-forth through relaxed cheeks or puckering lips on opposite corners alternatively or even smiling with gritted teeth briefly to target specific areas. By integrating these patterns into your daily routine, you may enjoy better-defined, firmer facial features with the added benefit of potentially losing weight as well. 3. Reduce Alcohol Consumption Excessive alcohol intake can cause dehydration, prompting the body to retain water. In some cases, water retention can lead to bloating and puffiness in the face, making it appear larger. Alcohol also contains empty calories, which offer no nutritional benefit and can contribute to weight gain. To lose facial fat effectively, consider reducing your alcohol consumption or limiting it to moderate levels, defined as up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women. 4. Drink More Water Drinking water can help you feel fuller, reduce your overall caloric intake, and promote gradual weight loss. Additionally, water consumption promotes lipolysis, the process by which the body breaks down fat stores into fatty acids used as energy. By staying well-hydrated, you can support overall weight management, which in turn may help decrease facial fat. 5. Get Adequate Sleep Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing weight gain, which can contribute to facial fat. Lack of sleep can affect hormone levels, increasing appetite and leading to higher caloric intake. Aim for at least 8 hours of sleep per night to support weight management and facial fat reduction. 6. Improve Overall Diet Consuming diet high in processed foods and refined carbohydrates will increase risk of weight gain and obesity. Processed foods often contain more calories, salt, and sugar than whole foods, while refined carbohydrates lack essential nutrients and fiber. To lose facial fat effectively, focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in lean proteins, whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. By combining a healthy diet with regular exercise, you can lose excess fat in the face and body. 7. Reduce Salt Intake High salt intake can cause water retention, leading to swelling and puffiness in various parts of the body, including the face. To reduce facial fat, try limiting your consumption of high-salt foods, like processed meals and snacks. Preparing meals and snacks at home allows you more control over amount of salt in your diet, helping you achieve slimmer face. 8. Focus on Overall Weight Loss As mentioned earlier, spot reduction, or targeted fat loss from a specific part of the body, is not supported by scientific evidence. Instead, focus on reducing overall body fat through healthy diet and lifestyle changes. If you lose weight, you are likely to see a slimming effect on your face well. 9. Incorporate Yoga Poses Yoga poses can help tone and stretch facial muscles, contributing to a slimmer face. Some effective yoga poses for facial fat reduction include Simha Mudra (Lion Pose) and Jivha Bandha (Locked Tongue Pose). Practicing these poses regularly can help improve facial muscle tone and provide a more youthful, sculpted appearance. 10. Implement Lifestyle Changes Long-term habits and broader lifestyle changes play a significant role in preventing weight gain and fat accumulation. To maintain a healthy weight and prevent facial fat, consider the following tips. Exercise regularly, incorporating cardio routines to improve overall health and prevent weight gain.Eat a balanced diet rich in lean protein, whole fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Limit the consumption of processed foods and refined carbohydrates.Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks, including energy drinks, juices, and sodas.Prioritize sleep, aiming for at least 8 hours per night.Manage stress levels through techniques such as yoga, meditation, and mindfulness practices. Frequently Asked Questions How can I lose face fat in a week? It will be challenging to lose a significant amount of facial fat in just one week, you can take steps to reduce swelling and fluid retention, making your face appear slimmer. Focus on staying hydrated, reducing alcohol consumption, getting enough sleep, and limiting salt intake to see quick improvements. What kills face fat? There is no specific “magic bullet” to eliminate facial fat. However, a combination of healthy lifestyle habits, such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, proper hydration, and adequate sleep, can help reduce facial fat over time. Conclusion Losing facial fat can be a grueling process, but by incorporating the strategies outlined in this companion, you can achieve a slimmer, more sculpted face. Flash back to prioritize overall weight loss and borrow healthy life habits to support long- continuing results. Always consult with healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine to insure your approach is safe and effective for your individual requirements."},{"instruction":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","output":"Imagine a question is asked - Q : Would you rather have 30 million dollars or 30 million loyal friend?

If we look at the stop sign example given by other contributor here, the sign serves the purpose of protection from danger. It might be who stops is protected, or someone else. However, the danger must be real and probable. Otherwise a stop sign would be ignored in a short while. The “signifier\\" should better do his job right to earn a paycheck. Accordingly, Derrida offers a fantasy that a “signifier” has the power of creating authority through a symbol. The symbol is only taken seriously when a probable harm is abstracted with it. Either reality is corresponded, or the sign is a decoration. Subjectivists have a tendency of buying Derrida's stuff. It is about hearing what they want to hear.

Just imagine the vastness of the cosmos and the countless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. *Our brains are incredible organs, and it's astonishing to learn that the human brain generates more electrical impulses in a single day than all the telephones in the world combined. It's a testament to the complexity and power of our minds. *When it comes to biodiversity, the Amazon rainforest is a true marvel. It houses about 10% of all the species on Earth, making it one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. The intricate web of life within the rainforest is truly awe-inspiring. *Moving from the macro to the micro, did you know that a teaspoon of soil contains more living organisms than there are people on the planet? It's incredible to think about the hidden world beneath our feet and the essential role these microorganisms play in sustaining life. *The Great Wall of China, often considered one of the most impressive man-made structures, stretches over 13,000 miles (21,196 kilometers) in length. It's so extensive that it can be seen from space—an awe-inspiring testament to human engineering and determination. *The world's oceans are a source of endless fascination. Did you know that we have explored less than 5% of them? The vast majority of the ocean remains uncharted, holding countless mysteries and undiscovered species. *In terms of scale, consider this: If our solar system were the size of a typical dinner plate, the Milky Way galaxy would span the distance of about two football fields. And the universe contains billions of galaxies! Contemplating the vastness of space can leave us in awe of its sheer magnitude. * Human DNA, the building block of life, is astonishingly complex. If you unraveled all the DNA molecules in a single human body and placed them end to end, they would stretch from the Earth to the Sun and back more than 300 times. It's a testament to the intricacy of our genetic code. * Time is a fascinating concept, and here's a mind-blowing fact: Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt, lived closer in time to the construction of the first Pizza Hut than she did to the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It highlights the vast stretches of history and the interconnectedness of different eras. * The human body is a remarkable machine. Every minute, your body produces about 2.5 million red blood cells, constantly replenishing your blood supply and ensuring the delivery of oxygen to every corner of your body. * The concept of deep time can be mind-boggling. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for a staggering 165 million years, compared to the mere few hundred thousand years of human existence. It puts our own place in the history of the planet into perspective. * The deepest part of the world's oceans is the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. Descending to a depth of approximately 36,070 feet (10,972 meters), it reaches deeper than the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on land. Exploring the mysteries of the deep sea is a reminder of the incredible diversity and resilience of life on Earth. * The largest living structure on Earth is the Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Australia. Stretching over 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers), it is composed of billions of tiny organisms called coral polyps. This vibrant underwater ecosystem is home to a multitude of marine species and showcases the beauty and complexity of our planet's biodiversity. * Light travels at a mind-boggling speed of approximately 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second). To put it into perspective, light from the Sun takes around 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth. Contemplating the speed at which light travels opens up a realm of possibilities and challenges our notions of time and distance. * The human body is a host to trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the human microbiome. In fact, these microorganisms outnumber our own cells by a ratio of about 3 to 1. This intricate symbiotic relationship between our bodies and the microorganisms living within us is a testament to the complexity of life and its interconnectedness. * The world's largest known living organism is a grove of quaking aspen trees in Utah, known as Pando. It covers an area of about 106 acres (43 hectares) and is estimated to be thousands of years old. Despite its massive size, Pando is considered a single organism, as all the trees in the grove are genetically identical and connected through a vast underground root system. * The phenomenon of black holes is both fascinating and mind-bending. These incredibly dense objects have gravitational forces so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp. The concept of black holes challenges our understanding of space, time, and the fundamental laws of physics. * The human brain is often touted as the most complex structure in the known universe. It contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each with thousands of connections, forming an intricate network that allows us to think, feel, and experience the world. Exploring the mysteries of the brain and its immense potential continues to be a captivating frontier of scientific discovery. *The concept of time dilation in Einstein's theory of relativity is fascinating.

Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, opening up new possibilities for technological advancements. 91. The \\"Mandlebrot Set\\" is a complex mathematical fractal named after Benoît Mandelbrot. It is generated by a simple iterative algorithm and displays intricate patterns that are infinitely complex and self-similar. 92. The \\"Coldest Place in the Universe\\" is the Boomerang Nebula, located approximately 5,000 light-years away from Earth. It has an average temperature of about 1 Kelvin (-272.15 degrees Celsius or -457.87 degrees Fahrenheit), making it even colder than the cosmic microwave background radiation. 93. The \\"Placebo Effect\\" is a phenomenon in which a person experiences a perceived improvement in their condition after receiving a treatment that has no therapeutic value. It highlights the powerful influence of the mind and belief on physical well-being. 94. The \\"Drake Equation\\" is a mathematical formula proposed by astrophysicist Frank Drake to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. It considers factors such as the rate of star formation, the probability of planets capable of supporting life, and the likelihood of intelligent life arising. 95. The \\"Great Oxidation Event\\" was a pivotal event in Earth's history that occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. It marked a significant rise in atmospheric oxygen levels due to the proliferation of photosynthetic organisms, leading to the eventual development of complex life forms. 96. The \\"Panspermia\\" hypothesis suggests that life on Earth may have originated from microorganisms or organic molecules transported through space on comets, meteoroids, or other celestial bodies. This idea raises intriguing possibilities about the interconnectedness of life in the universe. 97. The phenomenon of \\"quantum superposition\\" allows quantum particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. It is the basis for quantum computing and holds potential for revolutionizing information processing and cryptography. 98. The \\"Borromean Rings\\" are a mathematical construction of three interlocking rings that are interconnected in such a way that if one ring is removed, the other two fall apart. They represent an intriguing example of the mathematical concept of topological entanglement. 99. The \\"Beau Lotto Effect\\" refers to the ability of the brain to perceive colors differently based on surrounding context. This effect demonstrates the subjectivity of our perceptions and highlights how our brains actively construct our experience of reality. 100. The \\"Library of Babel\\" is a thought experiment proposed by writer and librarian Jorge Luis Borges.

Now how did I come to a dramatically different conclusion than what other people are saying? Simple. They are comparing the shuttle to what might have been, while I am comparing the shuttle to what had actually come before. Yes, the DOD pushed Congress to turn the shuttle into something far, far less than it could have been. Even so, it was the first reusable launch platform. Five shuttles flew well over 100 missions, and the shuttle was essential to building the international space station. The design of the shuttle was a factor in the losses of Challenger and Columbia. However, incompetence and bravado at NASA were the proximate causes. As a pragmatist, I don’t spend a ton of time thinking about what might have been. The space shuttle served as a launch and research/experimentation platform for three decades. I really can’t see how anybody can say that it was a failure.

It's a genius marketing tactic because then people would likely buy 2 different products for different purposes… the Mac and then the iPad. So for example, an artist can use the iPad to draw an animation, then transfer that to a Mac PC then to edit it. Or a business person can do work on a Mac PC, then use Apple's iCloud to save the documents then jump on their iPad to pull up that document if they need a touch screen. So really the answer is Apple wants the Mac experience to be the way they want it which is no touch screen.. and secondly, it's a great marketing tactic because it would mean a person would likely buy 2 different products.. if the Macbook had a touch screen and removable keyboard, then there would be little use for an iPad. So keeping touch screen separate from the Mac is a way for them maximize profit. By the way, Apple changed the OS name of the iPad because they don't want people to think it's using iOS when it is."},{"instruction":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

I moved to CA in 1989 to pursue a career in Federal Law Enforcement. The adjustment wasn’t too hard since the money I was to make doubled from where I was in AZ. It was also twice as expensive. Example: I went from 100/Mo in a 3bd/2ba house with two other roommates to paying 375/mo in a 2bd/2ba Apt with one other roommate. Plus utilities. Over the years the politics changed many things like property taxes, vehicle registration and cost of living. Still being connected to AZ and even GA where I was born, I could see how there wasn’t as significant of changes in those states. Mainly fuel prices. When I decided to retire at the end of 2016 I had no plan to leave although I talked the game with many coworkers. It became sensible when my girlfriend, who was still working, decided to pursue promotion back in AZ. I had to think about it long and hard. CA has its advantages and I had become used to it. On the other hand my kids were all adults now and only two of four remained there (a third left within a year of me). So after three years of retirement, off to AZ we went. You could notice the changes immediately. Fuel, food, taxes, the people. I registered a vehicle for two years which was less than one year in CA. And we got a beautiful house, one I never could’ve imagine living in as a child. Besides being back amongst old friends and family my confirmation came with my first year of filing taxes back in AZ. I paid 33% less in state taxes.

The seat is wider and closer to the ground, which makes them the safest type of stationary bike. More Number Of Targeted Muscles Cycling, in general, helps you build muscles in your thighs, legs, and glutes. Recumbent bikes target more number of muscles than other cycling exercises because your leg positions are different. Motivation To Push Harder and Farther The comfort of the recumbent bike helps you feel motivated through your workout. It’s more likely that you’ll hop back on the bike tomorrow if the bike is super comfortable and you love cycling on it. Not so if it causes butt and back pain. If you keep your body pain-free, you’ll be able to push harder. Increased Comfort There’s a good amount of research which shows that recumbent bikes are easier on the knees and back, and this makes them suitable for use by patients suffering from arthritis and similar problems. The larger seat, semi-reclining position, and back rest of the recumbent bike help in providing greater comfort and make sure that you do not encounter any pain in the buttocks after extended usage. These are some of the many benefits of a recumbent bike. Although the differences between all the bikes are very nuanced, the impact created is pretty huge!

In an RPG, you develop a character, a role, that you play in the game. You build a back story, a personality, and over time tell that character’s story of adventure and derring-do. Or, you could interpret the game as ignoring all that “role-playing” stuff, and merely go into dungeons, kick down doors, kill the monsters, and loot their corpses getting bigger and better stuff as you go. This latter way is generally looked down upon by serious RPG players. It’s considered childish, and players who play like that are referred to as “munchkins”, in reference to the characters from The Wizard of Oz. Wikipedia defines munchkins as synonymous with “powergamer”, and glosses it as “a player who plays a non-competitive game in a competitive manner”. It is not a positive term. The card game plays on that, deliberately invoking the name “Munchkin”, and boiling the game down to “Kick down the door, fight the monster, loot treasure, go to next room and repeat”. As a game, it’s basic concept is a joke, about how deep down that’s really how we want to play RPGs. That joke isn’t enough to carry the game very far. The basic mechanics could lead to a single-player game, but doesn’t really by itself carry a multiplayer game. So mechanics of alliances and backstabbing are added — other players can help you fight the monster, in exchange for a share of the loot, and other players can also interfere to hinder you. Great! Interaction between the players! But not a lot, and nothing you can count on. It also has positive feedback loops and no real negative feedback loops: If you do well, you get better equipment, which makes it more likely for you to keep doing well, etc, exponentially. If you are doing poorly, you can’t catch up. The only negative feedback happens when players gang up on whomever is in the lead. Usually, this only delays the inevitable, as players burn through their cards trying to stop the one player at Level 9 from winning even one fight against a randomly chosen monster. Sometime the delay can be substantial, and the game feels like you quickly move up through the lower levels (where you don’t have a lot of power alone, and spend a lot of time helping each other or running away), and then get near the top and the game turns into a slog (where every player is trying to stop the front-runner, with some success, until the front-runner gets lucky and no one can stop them). It is easy to see who is ahead at any time; it is easy to see who has a lot of strength. There is no mystery to the scoring, there is no mystery to the strategy. Compare that to a lot of other popular games. “Ticket To Ride” has many ways to earn points towards winning, some of which aren’t revealed until the end of the game. The suspense as to who is going to win can, and often does, last until the very end."},{"instruction":"As a stayathome parent, how much help do you get from your partner when running the home and looking after the kids?","output":"I didn't get any.

Alpha is a word which states the characteristics of a confident male with a clear vision on how he wishes to carry himself, and the objectices he wishes to accomplish, while taking full responsibility over the consequences of his existance; positive or negative, he makes sure to handle it. These attributes when meshed with the functions of an INFJ would produce an individual who's not considered with the exterior factors provided by anywhat and anywho. In more detail, an alpha INFJ has taken the responsibility of developing his introverted intuition, extraverted feeling, introverted thinking, and extraverted sensing. In order to gather as much information as possible about the exterior world, while using the introverted intuition to come up with various theories as to what the best plan is required in order to reach thd objective at hand ( Whatever it may be ). From an exterior point of view, the alpha INFJ is calm and collected because he has mastered patience, when the opportunity arises he executes the theorie he had come up with via introverted intuition, while utilising extraverted feeling in order to preserve the dignity of other males, all while scoring a touchdown such as in this answer. Then he retreats wherever he finds peace to work on his one big dream. Why does an Alpha INFJ retreat after scoring ? An Alpha INFJ has developed his understanding of existance as a whole, so his ideas and emotions are very deep and mature. He understands the consequences of a simple word, or a simple touch. Exterior environment has not made such sacrifices in order to possess a strong consciousness, which means that the exterior environment is immature, dull, and completely irrelavent because the majority of people would say and do anything for a direct on the spot result, an Alpha INFJ is too wise to make such reckless moves. He only executes when it is necessary in order to bring about positivity in his life and those beloved to him.

She helps in the kitchen and bathroom, she's a capable exterminator and, most importantly, she only charges a small fee, payable in chicken wings and turkey treats. To be of help, my cat observes the washing machine and immediately brings every rotation she deems out of beat to my attention by meowing loudly. Despite being profoundly gifted in kitchen stuff, my cat unfortunately lacks work ethic. She knows how to turn on the coffee maker, but rarely sees fit that there’s a cup beneath it. Watching coffee drip to the floor seems to give her an odd kind of satisfaction. All in all my cat is an indispensable help.Without her my home would be a mess. Lara inspecting the laundry basket.

Is this borderline high?","output":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 mmHg falls within the prehypertension category, which means that it is slightly elevated but not yet considered high blood pressure (hypertension). However, it is still important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and make lifestyle changes to keep it within a healthy range.

It seems like most people that say he is shorter are trying to make him seem even more special than he is which makes no sense to me because Curry is one of the most special players in nba history. The average height in the NBA is around 6’6” so he is already around 3 inches shorter than the average player and I think his ability to shoot speaks for itself so to be honest I have no idea why people claim he is shorter than he is when his actual height is already pretty short to be in the nba."},{"instruction":"Why is Gov.

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.
