Given material: Beijing and Washington have launched a digital arms race that could spill over into other areas. Last month, the private cybersecurity firm Mandiant issued a report claiming to directly link the Chinese military to cyber espionage against American and other western economic targets. The detailed report alleges that People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 61398 is stealing business and technological secrets in support of China’s twelfth five-year plan for economic development, but also suggested Unit 61398 is only one of many units engaged in the theft of sensitive U.S. economic data. If true, these allegations would confirm the long-held suspicion among many analysts that the Chinese government is involved in economic cyber espionage. Although significant in its own right, the PLA’s apparent involvement in cyber espionage has broader implications. In particular, the allegations against Unit 61398 and other recent developments highlight the emerging great game in cyberspace across the Asia-Pacific—as well as the growing link between competition in cyberspace and traditional geopolitics. Moreover, these economic cybersecurity challenges originate disproportionately from the Asia-Pacific, the emerging global power center and increasing focal point of American security policy. A 2012 report by the Internet firm Akamai alleges that 51 percent of cybersecurity breaches worldwide originate in the Asia-Pacific, with one third of global totals originating from China. But the emerging great game in cyberspace for access to sensitive data stretches across both sides of the Pacific. China in particular is feeling increased pressure. In response to the Mandiant report, the Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman Gang Yenshang claimed that of attempts to hack PLA military websites, nearly 63 percent originated from the United States. Despite the already historic nature of cybersecurity challenges there are a number of signs that cyber tensions across the Pacific are likely to intensify. More troubling, these tensions are breaking out of cyberspace and generating new risks for regional geopolitics. First, Beijing and Washington appear to be inching closer towards history’s inaugural large-scale cyber arms race. In Beijing, the PLA is continuing its efforts to be able to “win local wars under conditions of informationalization” by mid-century. This includes developing military cyber capabilities to help achieve information dominance during conflict—a theme that is repeated in authoritative Chinese military texts. In Washington, the Pentagon is proceeding with a number of high-level cyber initiatives. Over the next few years, the Department of Defense plans to increase its cyber personnel by five-fold. The military is also funding aggressive research projects like DARPA’s “Plan X,” which aims to achieve major breakthroughs in military cyber technology. While neither state’s military cyber programs are directed exclusively at the other, there is no doubt that the threat perception between Beijing and Washington plays a substantial role in developing military cyber power on both sides. But the potential effects of these developments are not confined to the military dimension of the Sino-U.S. relationship. Instead, there is growing potential for feedback between the competition for military advantage in cyberspace and the conduct of economic cyber espionage. Given the apparent Chinese military involvement in economic espionage in cyberspace, future increases in the capabilities of Chinese government cyber actors—like PLA Unit 61398—would translate into greater ability to steal economic data from foreign economies. Therefore, as competition with the U.S. military drives the PLA to become more capable in cyberspace, an unintended consequence for Washington may be undermining U.S. economic cybersecurity. Second, cyber tensions between Washington and Beijing are becoming more strongly linked to the broader bilateral relationship. Following the release the Mandiant report, the New York Times reported that the Obama administration views Chinese cyber intrusions as “so intense that they threaten the fundamental relationship between Washington and Beijing.” Far from a knee-jerk reaction, this follows former Secretary Clinton’s initiative over the past year to elevate the significance of cybersecurity at the U.S.-Chinese Economic and Security Dialogue. Beyond words, the Obama administration is already injecting cybersecurity objectives into its major actions in the region. The administration’s recent Strategy on Mitigating the Theft of U.S. Trade Secrets is a case in point. The strategy, which was released on the same day as the Mandiant report, focuses heavily on cyber theft. Among its many provisions, the document highlights the importance of “trade secret protections” in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free-trade agreement being negotiated by the United States and ten other Asia-Pacific economies. To be sure, inserting trade-secret protections into the TPP is part of a broader attempt to create norms against economic espionage in cyberspace—an effort that spans well beyond U.S. competition with China. Nonetheless, the reality that China leads the international theft of sensitive American economic data makes it difficult to reach any conclusion other than that the move is at least in part directed towards Beijing. Chinese leaders are predisposed to reach a similar conclusion, only in much stronger terms. A 2011 commentary appearing in the Party-controlled People’s Daily voiced the common view that the TPP is in part intended “to constrain China’s rise,” something partially evidenced to Beijing by the fact that China has not been included in TPP negotiations. While China is not formally precluded from joining TPP accession negotiations, the high standards of the agreement regarding intellectual-property and trade-secret protections make Beijing’s accession effectively impossible given its behavior in cyberspace. While Beijing’s concerns are overblown, the TPP does demonstrate growing momentum on Washington’s part to use a comprehensive approach outside of cyberspace to protect sensitive data from theft led by Chinese actors. Although such protective measures are not unreasonable, in the case of the TPP they nonetheless insert the adversarial logic of cybersecurity into the logic of economic competition and accommodation. However understandable, these developments entail notable risk. Common wisdom holds that economic interdependence undergirds political stability between states. But the stabilizing effects of interdependence in the Asia-Pacific may be lessened by extending aspects of U.S.-Chinese security competition, whether cyber or otherwise, into the region’s economic architecture. While trade-secrets protections in the TPP alone certainly cannot corrupt the stabilizing effects of the region’s economy, relations between great powers would risk exactly that outcome if they make a norm out of using trade as a disciplinary tool for cyberspace or other security conflicts. And if the U.S. government is in the business of norm making, these risks deserve very real and public consideration. There is no doubt that Washington has to increase efforts to protect the American economy from exploitation in cyberspace. Yet, just as the need for the United States to tackle the historic challenge of cybersecurity is increasing, so too are the risks of missteps. While great powers have had to adjust to each other before, this is the first time that budding great-power competition and cooperation has had to find its way through cyberspace. All the more reason for balance and caution. Bill French is a policy analyst at the National Security Network. Follow him at @BillyBobFrench.

The Caller seems to have had something of a revelation as regards Princess Dumbass Of The Northwoods. Before we go any further, I should confess that I might be one of the most unusual Palin critics you'll ever encounter. Before most Americans had ever heard of her, I was among the few suggesting she'd make a fine veep pick. My intern at the time even started the Draft Sarah Palin movement. A few years later, I edited a book of Palin quotes, titled The Quotable Rogue. I defended her when some on the left said she was to blame for Gabby Giffords' shooting, and recently defended her daughter Bristol when the press laughed at her for being a victim of what certainly sounded like a physical assault. (Ed. Note: Please consult police tape for further details.) (For what it's worth, I've also criticized Palin when I thought she was wrong.) This is all to say that I'm not reflexively anti-Palin; I don't suffer from Palin Derangement Syndrome. Watching them toss her over the side has been great fun, but not as much fun as what I am sure is coming next -- Sarah Palin Against Just About Everybody Except Matt Continetti.","output":"Based on the given material, it appears that the author has a history of defending Sarah Palin and has taken a nuanced stance towards her.

Given material: The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.54 percent with an average 0.5 point. This is down from 3.60 percent last week. One year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.00 percent. Home prices rose 1.1 percent in April month-over-month. They were up 5.6 percent year-over-year. Foreclosed and REO properties comprised 9.8 percent of existing home sales, down from 11.6 percent in March 2016 and 11.5 percent in April 2015. Mortgage applications decreased 2.4 percent from one week earlier. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 55.3 percent of total applications from 53.8 percent the previous week. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances (417,000 or less) decreased to 3.79 percent from 3.83 percent.","output":"Based on the given material, over the past two weeks, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances decreased from 3.60% to 3.54%.

The decrease in rates may be indicative of market conditions or government interventions such as monetary policy changes by the Central Banks. It's also worth noting that home prices rose in April, with an increase of 1.1% from the previous month and 5.6% from last year. Lastly, the percentage of foreclosed and REO properties in existing home sales decreased from 11.6% in March 2016 to 9.8% in the latest data, and likewise from 11.5% in April 2015 to 9.8%.

Given material: What now for US Afghan mission after Kandahar shootings? With fears of reprisal attacks and a mass walk-out of Kabul’s parliament, Channel 4 News examines what lies ahead for the US soldier accused of killing Afghan civilians – and for the whole mission. At about 3am on Saturday morning, a US Army staff sergeant left his barracks in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, and walked to two villages in the Panjwai district where he opened fire on residents as they slept in their beds. Going from house to house the sergeant, who has not yet been officially identified, shot dead 16 people, including nine children, and wounded another five, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry told Channel 4 News. Afterwards, a spokesman for the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (Isaf) said, he returned back and handed himself in. An investigation has now been launched into the killing spree, described by President Obama as “heartbreaking” and “tragic”. The serviceman is being held in US military custody in Kandahar. Earlier, members of parliament in the capital Kabul staged a mass walk-out in protest at the killings, demanding that the accused be tried and punished on Afghan soil. But the widespread revulsion has spread far beyond Afghanistan’s borders. In the UK and the US, a clamour for allied forces to speed up their withdrawal from Afghanistan is gaining more support, while the soldier responsible faces years in jail. Captain Brockhoff said that at least 13 civilians were killed, however Afghan authorities say that they are aware of 16 deaths. “The individual, after conducting the alleged shooting, returned to the post and was taken into the custody of the coalition forces. US forces in Afghanistan directed an investigation, and that is underway now,” Captain Brockhoff said. US military officials believe the man, who is said to be in his mid-30s, and a married father-of-two, acted “alone, as one individual”. It is understood that he is from the Fort Lewis base in Washington state. The installation, known officially as the Joint Base Lewis-McChord, was also where Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, who was convicted in November last year of the “trophy” killings of three Afghan civilians in which he cut off the fingers of the corpse as souvenirs afterwards, was based. Although officials are unable to give a precise timescale for the events which are due to follow, it is expected that officials based at the Kabul headquarters of the US forces, which are led by commander General John Allen, will conduct an investigation, and produce a report. The investigation could lead to criminal charges against the staff sergeant if he has violated US Uniform Code of Military Justice. At that stage, military officials are entitled to officially release the identity of the staff sergeant, along with the charges he will face. He will then go before the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, known under the code as an Article 32 hearing, where military prosecutors may present evidence against him before proceeding with a court martial. Any subsequent court martial may be heard in the open and can take place before a jury, consisting of military members, and presided over by a military judge. However, military officials say, “in some extreme circumstances”, or at the direction of the military judge, proceedings can also be heard in private. If he is found guilty, sentences handed down will normally be considered against the severity of the crimes. The investigation will remain firmly in the hands of US officials, military sources have told Channel 4 News. The parliament in Kabul debated today whether the serviceman should be tried in Afghanistan, and punished in Afghanistan. The walkout was staged as a gesture of protest against the incident, with demands for justice on Afghanistani soil. Coming just a month after US forces burned copies of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, at Bagram air base, and two months after a video of US forces urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters was leaked onto the internet, the latest incident has added to calls for allied forces to withdraw from the country soon. One government official based in Kabul, who asked not to be named, said: “People are really sad. It is so tragic – these people were killed so brutally as they were sleeping in their beds. Poor kids, who were just two or three years old, somebody just came into their houses at night and killed them. “Of course, people are now saying they want to see the international forces leave the country, especially after incidents like this, or like the Koran burning – after so many years, how could the US soldiers not know about the holy book of the Muslim population? When asked whether this would ever happen, US military officials admitted it was unlikely. “When an individual service member is charged with a crime, it’s the responsibility of [their] national authorities to prosecute if they have a reason to believe they should move forward with criminal action. US military officials would hold this individual under US military procedure. It just would not go to Afghanistan for justice,” the military source told Channel 4 News. The incident has been condemned by US and British ministers, with US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, saying she was “shocked and saddened by the killings of innocent Afghan villagers”. Speaking at 10 Downing Street, David Cameron also condemned the killings, but vowed that Britain and its Nato allies would “stick to the plan” already set out. The US force is 90,000-strong, and the US government has said it intends to leave at the end of 2014. Mr Cameron said: “This really is an absolutely appalling thing that has taken place and, of course, it will have its impact, but we must do everything we can to make sure it doesn’t in any way derail the very good work that American and British and other Isaf forces are doing in Afghanistan. “In terms of my talks with President Obama, we have a good plan. We have a plan which is about transitioning Afghanistan over to Afghan control. The most important thing is that we stick to that plan, we deliver that plan and then we can bring our troops home, having done a good job giving Afghanistan at least a chance of stability and prosperity and growth for the future.","output":"In the early hours of a Saturday morning, a US Army staff sergeant left his barracks in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, and walked to two villages in the Panjwai district.

Given material: It’s been suggested if the media alters the way they present information regarding climate change, it can influence the way we comprehend information on climate change and its effects. The United Nations came out with a report in October warning us if we don’t get our act together soon, the damage climate change will have on our planet will become irreversible. The evidence of climate change has been mounting throughout the last several decades, and yet we remain apathetic and complacent to the slow destruction of our home planet. We are already beginning to see the harmful effects climate change has on our planet. Global warming is triggering the ice caps in the Arctic to melt which, in turn, is causing sea levels to rise. As a coastal city, the consequences of this matter will likely be seen significantly here in San Diego. The homes and businesses located by the shoreline will eventually be underwater as the ocean moves further inland. It would hurt the environment, and the economy as well. This is not the only repercussion that we have seen. The massive fires in California over the past few years were caused by heat and drought — both brought on by climate change. An increase in extreme weather and irregularity in precipitation patterns could also cause a decline in agricultural production, leading to food shortages. Higher annual global temperatures may result in an increase of heat-related illnesses and cause longer allergy seasons. We are already witnessing the damages of climate change, but our willingness to actively promote and support the well-being of the planet is as low as ever. Our indifference may be attributed to the way our brains evolved to process information and danger. The human brain is wired to respond to immediate and direct threats. Climate change is a gradual, cumulative danger that has no visible effect on our day-to-day lives; our brains are unable to fully comprehend to this issue of great quantity and complexity. Most people understand climate change can negatively affect others, but do not believe it will harm them personally. Thus, we are left feeling impartial to climate change. We need to find a way to overcome this impartiality. Instead of the narrative that we are all doomed and incapable of reversing our fate, the use of selective framing will help people believe they have the ability and duty to take action. This means that media organizations, like television networks and news outlets, should take steps to frame climate change differently when presenting to various demographics. Tailoring how drastically climate change will impact specific demographics will make them more responsive. In a study conducted by the Social Science Quarterly, they found the way an article framed climate change to address different moral values of various ideological groups influenced the level of support toward environmental issues. For example, presenting climate change as a security risk or a human rights risk, then individuals will assign it great importance. The study used several different framing perspectives centering around science, religion and economics. A positive scientific framing focused on what we can do to improve the planet as opposed to negative scientific framing expressing how we will continue damaging the planet through our actions. Religious framing equated preserving the earth to protecting God’s creation. Economic framing emphasized socioeconomic equity and the potentially heavy costs in response to climate change in the future and that it would be more cost effective to invest in the environment now. The study found positive scientific and economic framing reduces the polarization of climate change and garners more support. The Trump administration continues to roll back on important environmental policies, and it is our responsibility to push back. If not, the effects of climate change will only worsen and if the recent UN report is accurate, our time to fix our ways is running out. We must find a way to care enough to take action by changing our habits and supporting environmentalist legislation to protect our home planet.","output":"The main arguments in the text regarding climate change and the role of media in influencing public perception are: 1.

Given material: Glitches • A much-criticized provision is among reasons lawmakers seek to tweak the law before it takes effect. Leah Hogsten | Tribune file photo Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Terry Buck gives a suspected impaired driver a sobriety test October 31, 2014. Steve Griffin | The Salt Lake Tribune Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, talks about HB155 during the third reading of the bill that amends provisions related to driving under the influence during debate in the House of Representatives at the State Capitol in Salt Lake City Thursday February 23, 2017. The bill passed the House 48-26 and advances to the Senate. Utah&apos;s new toughest-in-the-nation drunken driving law contains a little-noticed provision that would impose a not-a-drop-of-alcohol-before-driving standard for two years on foreign immigrants who obtain driving licenses here. \\"Prosecutors think it could become constitutionally problematic\\" because it would treat native and foreign drivers of the same age or experience differently, Will Carlson, a prosecutor for Salt Lake County speaking for prosecutors statewide, warned legislators on Wednesday. He added that prosecutors worry \\"that may have unintended consequences leading into areas akin to racial or ethnic profiling in traffic enforcement.\\" It was listed as one of several unintended consequences of HB155, known best for making Utah the first state to lower the blood alcohol content (BAC) for when a driver is presumed to be drunk from 0.08 to 0.05. Gov. Gary Herbert signed that bill into law, but called for it to be tweaked before it takes effect on Dec. 30, 2018  possibly in a special session just to focus on it. The Transportation Interim Committee started looking at some of the possible glitches on Wednesday. Its House chairman, Rep. Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said the committee will not consider full repeal of the law, only amendments to it  and the problem with new immigrants was at the top of the list. All Utah drivers under the legal drinking age of 21 currently are banned from driving after drinking even a drop of alcohol. HB155 sought to expand that limitation to all new \\"novice drivers\\" who obtain a license for the first time  even if they are older than 21  for a two-year period. Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, sponsor of the bill said, the idea was that since they are developing new driving skills, they are at high risk  and \\"if they have any alcohol at all, it&apos;s going to affect them.\\" The bill&apos;s definition of \\"novice driver\\" includes international immigrants who obtain a U.S. license for the first time in Utah  even if they had licenses abroad. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys called Wednesday for it to be stricken from the new law because it does not consider previous experience. Sen. Karen Mayne, D-West Valley City, also called for removal of the total drinking ban on novice drivers who are older than 21. \\"We need to fix that. A novice driver at 19 and a novice driver at 40 are totally different animals,\\" she said, adding that older drivers are \\"seasoned and mature and know what they are doing.\\" The committee focused on safety issues in the bill, discussing them with members of a DUI subcommittee of the Utah Substance Use and Mental Health Advisory Council. Richard Mauro, executive director of the Salt Lake Legal Defenders Association, said current field sobriety tests are designed to identify and fail people who have a BAC above .08  and some people between 0.05 and 0.079 might be able to perform well in them. He worries that could lead to more challenges of DUI arrests, and argued it is a reason for possible repeal. The Senate chairman of the committee, Gregg Buxton, R-Roy, questioned if it may be wise to allow lesser penalties for those arrested with BACs between 0.05 and 0.079. Carlson said prosecutors oppose that because it would complicate cases that involve both drinking and drug use  where a driver may have a low BAC, but was also impaired by drugs and likely deserves a stiffer penalty. Schultz said the committee next month will discuss how to lessen or resolve problems the bill may create for tourism and the hospitality industry, and will also take public testimony about problems. Thurston said he is working to solve some other issues, too. For example, the bill&apos;s definitions accidentally would make it a Class B misdemeanor for anyone with a 0.05 BAC or greater to carry a weapon  because weapons laws use DUI laws to define drunkenness. That would make criminals out of weapons carriers who are not driving, and who possibly even take a taxi or walk. Thurston said he also wants to more clearly address what civil liability a bar or restaurant owner  or even the host of a party  may have under dram shop laws for guests who drink, then are involved in a car accident and are found to exceed the new lower 0.05 BAC standard. Utah Highway Patrol Capt. Steven Winward told lawmakers the bill already may be cutting down on drinking and driving. The patrol&apos;s DUI squad reports \\"running into people now who already think the law is in effect\\" and choose not to drink and drive, Winward said, adding it appears that Uber and Lyft ride-hailing services \\"are getting more business.\\"","output":"Based on the given material, the unintended consequences of Utah's new drunken driving law that particularly affect foreign immigrants are: 1. Treating native and foreign drivers of the same age or experience differently: Prosecutors argue that this could lead to constitutional problems, as it would be unfair to treat drivers differently based on their immigration status. 2. Potential for racial or ethnic profiling in traffic enforcement: Prosecutors worry that law enforcement may target foreign immigrants more aggressively, leading to racial or ethnic profiling. 3. Lack of consideration for previous experience: The bill's definition of \\"novice driver\\" includes international immigrants who obtain a U.S. license for the first time, regardless of their previous driving experience abroad. This could lead to unintended consequences for foreign immigrants who may be more skilled and experienced drivers than younger, native drivers. 4. Complicated cases involving both drinking and drug use: Prosecutors oppose allowing lesser penalties for drivers with BACs between 0.05 and 0.079, as this could make it harder to prosecute cases involving both alcohol and drugs. 5. Unintended consequences for the hospitality industry: The committee will discuss how to lessen or resolve problems the bill may create for tourism and the hospitality industry, as the new law could negatively impact these industries. 6. Civil liability for bar or restaurant owners: Prosecutors also want to more clearly address what civil liability a bar or restaurant owner may have under dram shop laws for guests who drink and then are involved in a car accident. 7.

Given material: Danielle Goldstein of Israel during the Longines Global Champions Tour of Shanghai day 2 on April 30, 2016 in Shanghai, China. JERUSALEM (JTA) — An Israeli equestrian rider has withdrawn from next month’s world championships since the competition will take place on Yom Kippur. The International Equestrian Federation event, which will take place this year in North Carolina, is a prelude to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where Israel’s equestrian federation hopes to compete for the first time. Israeli rider Dan Kramer sent a letter earlier this month to the international federation saying that he would not compete due to the competition’s conflict with the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, Ynet reported last week. “I decided not to join the other members of the Israeli national team and not to participate in the upcoming world championships in the United States, because the competition is taking place on Yom Kippur and I want to honor this day as well as the Israeli public and Jewish Diaspora,” Kramer wrote in a letter to the Israel equestrian federation’s chairman Kenny Lalo, Ynet reported. Kramer, who is living in Belgium, grew up on Moshav Hayogev in northern Israel, where his family owned a horse and he dreamed of competing in the Olympics. He suffered a leg injury while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, and returned to riding as part of a physical therapy regimen. He qualified for next month’s world championship last year. An Israeli team that competes on Yom Kippur reportedly is punished severely, though equestrian team officials told Ynet that the team has received assurances from the relevant authorities that they would not be penalized for participating in the competition. The team members also could compete individually in the event but not as Israel’s team, according to the report.

The findings of the study suggest that smoking has a negative impact on cognitive function and brain health. Dr. Gandy emphasized that while all studies should be replicated to confirm authenticity, the fact that smoking is a modifiable factor makes it a significant concern.  Moreover, the given material also mentions that lifestyle choices, including avoiding smoking, regular exercise, and a balanced diet supplemented with vitamins, can enhance brainpower and brain resilience. However, the study indicated that despite these lifestyle changes, they cannot entirely prevent Alzheimer's disease.  Dr. Gandy discussed a variation in the study that he found quite interesting, noting that head injury is also a potential risk factor contributing to cognitive decline. However, reducing the risk of head injury is relatively challenging due to the fact that many of its sources, like sports and certain activities, are inherently risky. In contrast, avoiding smoking can be a relatively straightforward step toward mitigating this risk.  In summary, the study emphasized the detrimental effects of smoking on brain health, the importance of replicating research, the modifiable nature of smoking as a risk factor, and the potential benefits of nutrition, exercise, and avoiding smoking for enhancing brainpower and brain resilience.

Carlini’s motivation to win, as well as her dedication to excellence, have been recognized on the national spectrum too. The senior from UW was named to the U.S. Women’s National Team for the 2016 Pan American Cup in July. It proved to be great practice for her during the offseason, and allowed Carlini to surround herself with the best competition the continent has to offer. With Wisconsin head coach Kelly Sheffield in attendance, watching his star player taking on some of the best competition, Carlini and Team USA took home a bronze medal. The United States’ third-place finish came alongside familiar Big Ten rivals for Carlini. Micha Hancock and Megan Courtney from Penn State, and Justine Wong-Orantes from defending national-champion Nebraska, were also among the United States’ ranks. Playing alongside three elite players gave Carlini distinctive insight into the game of three quality opponents whom she often faces. But the senior was more focused on bettering herself and what it will take to elevate her game in order to win that elusive championship. With Carlini’s added edge and determination, Wisconsin could stand a good chance to make special things happen in 2016. Her skills and experiences will also be aided by the women around her. The Badgers have a promising roster for the 2016 season by returning the majority of a team that finished last season ranked No. 7 in the country, despite their Sweet 16 tournament stumble. Though they lost veteran libero Taylor Morey to graduation, Amber MacDonald will fill her role after a solid 2015 season in which she split time with Morey at libero. A dynamic group of hitters and middle bockers in Haleigh Nelson, Lauryn Gillis, Tionna Williams, Kriskova, and Madison Duello will also be at her disposal once more — an advantage which Sheffield plans to exploit by running a more diversified attack this season. Wisconsin should hit the ground running in a season that may just finally end with a title. They are fueled by their desire to take the final step.","output":"Based on Carlini's past performances and her recent recognition on the national level, as well as the strong returning roster and the team's determination to win, it is clear that Wisconsin has a good chance of making special things happen and winning the championship this year. Despite previous tournament stumbles, Carlini's motivation and dedication to excellence, along with her experience playing alongside elite players, will give the Badgers an added edge. With a promising roster and a more diversified attack, Wisconsin is poised to hit the ground running and finally achieve their goal of winning the title."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: Has DocuSign disclosed the number of shares they plan to sell and the price they plan to sell them at for their IPO?

Although it is 15 years old, Docusign posted strong revenue growth and big losses in the most recent fiscal year it disclosed. DocuSign is indeed planning to go public. The electronic signature company on Wednesday made public its S-1 document, the first regulatory step to an an initial public offering. DocuSign did not specify in the document how many shares it plans to sell or the price at which it plans to sell them. It nominally is seeking to raise as much as 100 million in the offering. The move follows reports from last week that Docusign had confidentially filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering has been a long time in the making.

Given material: More than half of Dutch nationals want their country'smilitary mission to Afghanistan to end after August 1, 2008. A similar amount wants the mission to end immediately. The findings, published on Friday in daily Algemeen Dagblad, result from a survey performed by the polling agency De Vos & Jansen. Among the 1,000 people polled, only 45 per cent support the mission. Most people question its usefulness. A minority of 45.6 per cent support extending the mission beyond August 1, 2008. For two-thirds of the people polled, the death of Dutch soldiers is not the main reason to withdraw support for the military mission. Instead, the survey appears to indicate the Dutch are not happy with the fact their military are spending most of their time on war activities and less on rebuilding civil society in Oruzgan. Before the military mission started in August 2006, the government presented the mission to the Dutch electorate as a way to help the Afghan people rebuild their country. Politicians promised that military activity would remain minimal. The main focus, they said, would be on restoring infrastructure and creating the circumstances for the Afghans to rebuild civil society. The survey published on Friday was performed before the 10th Dutch soldier died on Sunday. Some 1,665 Dutch troops are stationed in the province of Oruzgan as part of a larger NATO mission to Afghanistan. The mission, which began last year, was originally due to continue for two years. The Dutch government wants other NATO members to take over the command in Oruzgan after August 2008. The Netherlands recently repeated its formal request to Norway to take over the mission next year. However, neither Norway nor other countries have expressed an interest to replace the Dutch. The Dutch government is expected to decide about a possible extension of the mission no later than September.","output":"According to the given material, it appears that the Dutch government is looking for other NATO countries to take over the military mission in Afghanistan after August 2008.

Given material: Whether your company is still recovering from the recession or experiencing growing pains, Thanksgiving is a perfect time to pause and take control. Not of your business, take control of your mind by using mindfulness techniques. It will help you become a more self-aware leader who understands yourself, your motivations, your values and the purpose of your leadership. Over time, you will find that you have become more effective and satisfied in your work. Once the domain of hippies and flower children, the practice of mindfulness has gone mainstream. Google executives and even a U.S. senator sing its praises. In 2007, Chade-Meng Tan launched Google's meditation program, which currently teaches 2,000 Googlers per year to meditate in order to become better leaders. Companies like Aetna, Blackrock, Ford, General Mills, and Goldman Sachs are also believers. Tim Ryan, the Democrat Congressman from Ohio, is on the budget committee. No surprise that it’s a stressful position, rife with conflict. When Ryan vehemently disagrees with someone and his body clenches up, he practices mindfulness, so he told 60 Minutes in an interview. It is the nature of the mind to wander, said Kabat-Zinn. Rather than getting lost in each thought or chastising yourself for having the thought, bring your mind back to your breath. Mindfulness is about stopping, paying attention, becoming aware of present moment and not judging whatever is happening as ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ “Mediation is about paying attention in a systematic way for no reason other than to be awake,” said Kabat-Zin. It’s simple, although not necessarily easy. When stressful thoughts take over, don’t berate your staff or make a critical, irreversible decision. Instead, return to watching your breath. It is an opportunity to relax, de-stress and gain clarity about your work and the decisions you are facing, writes Bill George a Senior Fellow, Harvard Business School in the Huffington Post. Better yet start a daily practice of taking 15 minutes to quiet your mind, reflect and be introspective, he continues. Here are four ways you can practice mindfulness everyday. When a Thanksgiving guest gets on your nerves, note that they are doing so, then bring your attention to your breath. When you see the piles of food at the Thanksgiving table, instead of loading up your plate and stuffing yourself, breathe deeply and take a normal portion. Savor every bite. When Thanksgiving weekend sales tempt you to rush out the door, take some quiet time for yourself instead.","output":"Chade-Meng Tan introduced Google's meditation program to more than 2,000 employees per year by launching it in 2007.

Given material: Leigh Griffiths is a great Celtic striker in the making, according to former Bhoys goalkeeper Pat Bonner. Griffiths scored a brilliant opener in Wednesday's 2-1 win over Hearts. \\"He had a lot to do in that particular first goal, but his mind was working and you could see what he was thinking,\\" Bonner told BBC Scotland. \\"Even when he went through, he had the composure to knock it past the goalkeeper. That's the making of great strikers and great Celtic strikers.\\" Griffiths' goal in the Scottish League Cup quarter-final at Tynecastle took his tally to 12 in 22 games this season. The 25-year-old has held off competition from Nadir Ciftci, the £1.5m summer signing from Dundee United, to become the Scottish champions' first-choice striker. And the Scotland international showed his value by also setting up Celtic's second goal, scored by Tom Rogic, in Edinburgh. Bonner spent 20 years at Celtic Park, with Charlie Nicholas, Brian McClair, Andy Walker, Mark McGhee and Pierre van Hooijdonk among the top scorers during his time at the Glasgow club. \\"I've seen good strikers at Celtic and played with them and they didn't play brilliant in every single game,\\" Bonner said when explaining his admiration for Griffiths. \\"But they were always a threat. They were always there. \\"And sometimes, when they weren't playing well, that was when they were at their most threatening because they were waiting for that half chance.\\" Griffiths, who has yet to score in his six Scotland appearances, began his career with Livingston and, after a spell with Dundee, won a transfer to Wolverhampton Wanderers. He was immediately sent back to Scotland for the first of two loans spells with hometown club Hibernian in the Scottish top flight. Griffiths broke into the Wolves first-team at the beginning of the 2013-14 season and had scored 13 times for the English League One club before they accepted an offer from Celtic during the January transfer window and the striker signed a four-year contract. He found himself behind Anthony Stokes and on-loan Manchester City striker John Guidetti for much of last season after the arrival of Ronny Deila as manager but has become Celtic's leading marksman for this campaign. Griffiths ran the width of the park to celebrate his goal in front of the Hearts fans. The striker said: \\"The booking was a bit harsh, but if you give me a goal like that and a yellow card then I'll take it all day long. \\"I get abuse everywhere I go. Here you always get stick as an ex-Hibee, but the only way to shut them up is to score.\\"","output":"According to former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner, Leigh Griffiths is a great striker in the making and his recent performance against Hearts only solidifies that statement. Bonner praised Griffiths' composure and ability to read the game, which led to his brilliant opener in the 2-1 win. Prior to playing for Celtic, Griffiths had a successful career with Livingston, Dundee, and Wolverhampton Wanderers before being loaned back to Scotland and eventually being signed by Celtic. Despite facing competition from other strikers, Griffiths has become the first-choice for the Scottish champions and has already scored 12 goals in 22 games this season. His value was also shown in his assist for Celtic's second goal against Hearts. Bonner, who played with top strikers during his time at Celtic, admires Griffiths' ability to always be a threat on the field, even when not playing at his best. Griffiths' goal celebration in front of the Hearts fans may have earned him a yellow card, but he believes it was worth it to silence the critics."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: How did Hanson bounce back from his previous season when he failed to hit double figures and what did he learn from it? Given material: James Hanson reckons the tough times have helped mould him into a striker now feared by League Two defences. Boss Phil Parkinson rates City’s attacking combo of Hanson and Nahki Wells among the best in the division. As he tries to beef up the squad for a serious push next term, Parkinson would not swap his front two. Both have attracted jealous looks from rivals hoping to prise them away from Valley Parade. Hanson top-scored with 14 goals last term, his highest tally in three years as a professional. He bounced back to form from the previous campaign when he failed to hit double figures and seemed to be struck down by ‘second-season syndrome’ as defenders wised up to him. Hanson, currently halfway through a four-year contract, believes his game has come on leaps and bounds since then. But he admits the low periods when he did struggle – and came in for stick from some sections of the crowd – have formed an important part of his learning curve. The former shop worker said: “I scored 13 goals in my first year at Bradford but I definitely learned more from the time after that when it didn’t go so well. “During my second season and the beginning of the last one was tough. I had to fight the adversity when the team wasn’t playing well. Hanson’s fitness is no longer questioned by his critics. He looked leaner last term and followed Parkinson’s advice to chase down and harry opponents into making mistakes. “If I’m fit, running round and able to challenge everyone, then that helps me have a good game,” he said. “The gaffer has one-to-ones with me and outlines what I’ve got to do to play well. I can’t give defenders any free headers or time on the ball. “If I can do that all the time then my game falls into place and the goals come. “The second year was bad for everyone at the club. I did a lot of weights in that summer and it killed me from a fitness point of view.","output":"Hanson bounced back from his previous season where he failed to hit double figures after what he describes as a tough time.

Parkinson believes that Hanson and Wells form one of the best attacking combinations in the division, and he would not trade them for any other players. Last season, Hanson scored 14 goals, which was his highest tally in three years as a professional. He attributes his success to becoming healthier and fitter, as well as being able to chase down and harry opponents into making mistakes. Hanson believes that the difficult times he went through have been instrumental in his growth as a player.

Given material: In a dimly lit room, six pregnant women folded themselves into a downward-facing dog pose. With hands and feet planted on the purple yoga mat, the women formed bridges with their bodies, hips rose upward and swollen bellies hung below. At the front of the pre-natal yoga class stood instructor Neelu Shruti, 33, a petite woman from Hyderabad, India. As her soft voice instructed the class to move into a reverse warrior pose, Shruti radiated equanimity. From her small high school northeast of Bangalore, Shruti traveled to Texas to pursue a degree in architecture at the University of Texas at Austin in 2003. In 2007, she moved to New York City to work in the architecture field. Shruti continued to practice and teach yoga on the side as a prenatal yoga instructor, a certification which took her about 285 hours to complete. Among other titles and certifications, she is a fully trained doula, certified breast-feeding counselor and midwifery assistant. After realizing the disparity between prenatal yoga studios and convenient class times for women with jobs, Shruti mustered up the courage to pursue her passion, leave her desk job, and create Love Child in the West Village in 2015.

Given material: CHANDIGARH: More than 8,000 patients come to Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI) every day. What do you do then when you have a campus that is teeming with monkeys, suspicious of strangers? In India, the age-old practice is to employ a madari, a langur-trainer. The idea is that, langurs, which are more possessive of its territory, would chase away the more common, Macaca mulatta that have become increasingly bold in human habitats. The catch though is the fact that according to the Prevention of Cruelty Animals Act,1960, langurs are protected species and keeping them is a crime. After years of dealing with the menace, according to the PGI officials, the institute of national repute managed to convey to Animal Welfare Board of India and various other committees, the urgency of the situation and get permission to hire langurs to keep the monkeys at bay at the institute. \\"About eight years ago, a petition was filed in the high court for hiring langur keepers here. We presented our problems and the court allowed us to hire langur keepers. We had submitted a compliance report on this,\\" said PC Sharma, chief security officer of PGI. But the simian menace in the PGI refuses to go away despite hiring two langur keepers in the last decade. Though the monkey menace has reduced significantly with langurs around, the monkeys find some or the other way to enter the hospital. \\"These animals are smart. The langurs are in the campus between 9am and 5pm. Guess what, the monkeys come after they leave and make a menace of themselves,\\" said a security official. Now the institute is facing yet another problem: Finding trained langur keepers has become harder, as the profession is deemed illegal these days. Mostly of them come from Rajasthan. In PGI, every two years or so, the contracts of the langur keepers are renewed. Recently, the institute has floated a tender for hiring langur keepers. According to PGI, the ones previously employed demand more salary. \\"Over the years, we have increased it from Rs 14,000 to Rs 21,000, a month. However, it's not easy to find these langur keepers and tenders have been floated repeatedly,\\" said Sharma. It is believed that the monkeys come from the forest area nearby. The easy availability of food is a big draw for them, agreed Sharma. And now with langur keepers at such short supply, it is not clear how the institute proposes to tackle this problem.","output":"According to the given material, PGI was able to get permission to hire langurs despite their protected status because they presented their problems to the Animal Welfare Board of India and other committees, highlighting the urgency of the situation.

Given material: If you go out for lunch on Thursday, look up in the sky. Is it a bird? is it a plane? No — it’s the sun shining right on top of the equator. It must be spring! The astronomical version of spring 2014 occurs at 12:57 p.m. EDT, right about the time you’re ordering your cup of coffee or last iced tea refill at the local eatery. The birds will be singing, a gentle breeze will be blowing in off the Atlantic, and the flowers will be in full bloom. But wait a minute. That’s true of every day in Palm Beach. Sunrise Thursday will be at 7:24 a.m. and it will set at 7:31 p.m. That’s pretty close to an even 12 hours of day and night. But it was closer last Saturday, the 15th, when the sun rose at 7:30 a.m. and set at 7:29 p.m. On Sunday, it was 7:28 a.m. and 7:29 p.m., so there was never a day with exactly 12 hours of daylight. The numbers are skewed slightly because the sun’s rays are refracted by the atmosphere, allowing people to see the sun before it actually pokes its head above the horizon, and for a minute or two after it sets in the west. Spring does not promote the wild celebration in South Florida that it does elsewhere. The average high on Thursday is 79 and the normal low is 63. By the end of April, that’s advanced to a high of 84 and a low of 68. But in Chicago, which sits next to a gigantic ice cube known as Lake Michigan, the average March 20 high temperature is 48 and the average low is 31. On April 30, the high is 65 and the low is 44. In Boston, the average March 20 high is 46 with a low of 32. On April 30, that jumps to 61 and 45. The average temperatures for the same period in New York City rise from 49 and 33 to 63 and 47. A cold spring has been forecast for most of the Eastern U.S., with the exception of Florida. Warm temperatures are expected for the Desert Southwest. NOAA releases its new forecast for April, May and June on Thursday.","output":"Atmospheric conditions, such as the presence of dust, pollution, and moisture, can affect the appearance of the sun during sunrise and sunset. As the sun's rays pass through the atmosphere, they can be refracted, or bent, changing the way we perceive the sun's position in the sky. This refraction can cause the sun to appear higher in the sky than it actually is, particularly during sunrise and sunset when the sun's rays must pass through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Additionally, the presence of dust or pollution in the atmosphere can scatter the sun's rays, creating vibrant colors in the sky during sunrise and sunset. This phenomenon, known as \\"Alexander's band,\\" occurs when short-wavelength light is scattered by particles in the atmosphere, leaving only the longer-wavelength, red light to reach our eyes. This is why the sky often appears reddish or orange during sunrise and sunset. Furthermore, moisture in the atmosphere can cause the sun to appear larger or more diffuse during sunrise and sunset. This effect, known as the \\"green flash,\\" occurs when light from the sun is bent, or refracted, as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. This refraction can cause the sun to appear larger and somewhat distorted, particularly when viewed through a moisture-laden atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: How does AVA, the chatbot developed by AvePoint, work to retrieve lost content in Exchange and OneDrive for users on Microsoft Teams? Given material: Plenty of workplace bots have appeared over the last few years, and, for some businesses, bots are an integral part of the digital transformation strategy. One example helps retrieve lost documents. When suitably designed and implemented with care, chatbots can save time, money and frustrations for customer. Several leading companies have successfully deployed bots, such as Virgin Atlantic, DFS, Facebook and The Bot Platform. To understand how bots can be used to transform communications, culture and workflows inside organisations of all shapes, sizes and industries, and how bots can contribute to digital transformation initiatives, we spoke with John Hodges, VP of Product Strategy at AvePoint. AvePoint Virtual Assistant was the first bot developed to locate and restore Office 365 content for end users. Digital Journal: What are the benefits if digital transformation for businesses? John Hodges: Digital transformation is often seen as a way for businesses to attract younger employees by engaging them using the technology they’re familiar with in their personal life. I look at it for one of its other advantages: cost savings. AvePoint has helped companies drive digital transformation of information management and operational governance that often directly impacts the operational budget for an IT organization. In our recent update, AVA focuses on the cost-savings that can be attained by taking away some of the low-hanging help-desk calls IT often has to respond to regarding lost content. DJ: How can workplace bots assist with this process? Hodges: Everyday IT workers have a choice: take on the urgent, or the important. Urgent tasks often come in the form of tickets or calls that point to lost content or missing documents that are getting in the way of business. However, important strategic planning tasks like operational governance automation, learning new technologies or records management often get pushed aside to handle these tickets. Having a bot handle many of the urgent tasks gives more time for important strategic tasks that drive digital transformation. DJ: How important is Microsoft Teams for businesses? Hodges:Any unified platform that provides a way to engage the entire business is going to be critical. Microsoft Teams combines the best of community engagement with knowledge management platforms. While other social platforms are popular in pockets of the business, in developing our chatbot, we needed a platform that allowed us to reach directly back to the business on the platform they felt the most comfortable with, and Teams provided us with that. DJ: How common is it to lose Office documents? Hodges:Document loss is relatively common among business users. It can be as simple as a broken URL to a document that you once used as a reference or an unexpected change when someone was granted more rights to a document than expected. We’ve even seen unintended consequences of “Files Restore” from OneDrive where users rolled back more changes than they expected! It’s far more common, though, to see a manager request documents from former employees or recover permissions and settings on a site that have been broken. DJ: Why did you develop AVA? Hodges: AvePoint’s solutions have been focused on making the life of the IT Admin easier since we started the company. In an effort to give time back to today’s IT professional, we wanted to engage end users directly to handle the most common service requests. While an app could provide the same functionality to help users recover their content, it wouldn’t give us the same ability to engage them right where they are and understand their original intent. Given Microsoft Team’s pervasiveness in the enterprise, this was the perfect place to create an app! DJ: What functions does AVA have? Hodges:AVA is a chatbot that responds to user requests in Microsoft Teams to recover lost content in Exchange and OneDrive. AVA has two models: a free option that helps users look through their native recycle bin and deleted items folder for lost content, and a premium option that pairs with AvePoint Cloud Backup to look for content beyond the 90-day Microsoft limits. AVA works in the context of the user, meaning we never search for content the user doesn’t have access to. Search can work against a number of metadata fields – to help respond to vague requests – and restore data in place or to a new folder in their OneDrive or Mailbox. DJ: How have you tested AVA out? Hodges: AvePoint has been an early adopter of Teams and Office 365 for years, ensuring that we are able to practice what we preach when it comes to governance in the cloud. Our employees have had the opportunity to experience the highs and lows of life in the cloud – meaning they were eager to adopt our chatbot to help with some of their more common requests. DJ: What has the response from businesses been like? Hodges:End user engagement has been an important criteria in Managed Service Providers (MSPs), larger enterprises and even teams with smaller IT staff. This has been a big step forward regarding attention from the market! DJ: What else are you working on? Hodges:AVA has illustrated an important concept – you need to meet the users where they are. We’re excited to be working toward bringing many more AvePoint products directly to end users through the same AVA chatbot framework, and will be announcing more of these updates in the coming months.","output":"AVA, the chatbot developed by AvePoint, works to retrieve lost content in Exchange and OneDrive for users on Microsoft Teams by responding to user requests in Teams to recover lost content.

Given material: About the Writer: Rachel Becker is a sophomore here at the College of William & Mary with a keen interest in leadership theory. In her free time she likes to re-read Harry Potter, organize her organizing and apparently write blog posts. Rachel Becker enjoying time in Colonial Williamsburg! My youngest cousin, Lauren, is the spunkiest fourteen-year-old you will ever meet. She loves to laugh more than anything, her wit absolutely does not match her age and she is probably the most outspoken person I know. The adults in our family actually ask for her opinion on things and usually will follow; it is quite impressive. One time I saw them leave a restaurant right after they sat down just because Lauren knew the food down the street was better. I also think she skipped an awkward middle school phase, because she dresses better than I do on a daily basis and she is a freshman in high school which is really unfair and feels sacrilegious. But besides Lauren’s vibrant nature, she also has this incredible trait of self-confidence. She is not afraid to stick up for herself or others and because of this I really look up to her, especially given her age. I am nearly ten years older, but I would consider her a mentor to me because she has a way of telling me she believes in me without having to explicitly state it. Her compliments are very personalized, and usually make you tilt your head but nonetheless are very sweet. One time she told me that a boy was dating me only because I had great hair. It was honestly so flattering. People like Lauren remind me that literally anyone can be a mentor, and you should never be afraid to admire someone even if they do not have a lot in common with you, that really anyone can be someone you look up to. When I am faced with challenges whether it be socially or academically, I think of Lauren’s fervent confidence in me and it reminds me that I am completely capable of what I am trying to accomplish. Surrounding yourself with people who believe in you is something that can make a big difference in your life, just as it is important to remind the people around you that you believe in them. 3. Be yourself! Someone looks up to you for being YOU, try to avoid worrying about what other people may think or about comparing yourself to others, your uniqueness is an advantage! In the Office of Student Leadership Development, we are recognizing National Mentoring Month to celebrate why Mentoring Matters. Research shows that mentoring connects students to personal growth and development and helps students recognize that they are not alone in their personal challenges (National Mentoring Partnership, 2017). We encourage you to stop by the CORT area adjacent to the Scheduling Office to write a thank you note to someone who has been a mentor to you! Thank you notes will be available through the month of January.","output":"Based on the given material, here is a response to the question/instruction: Mentoring can have a profound impact on personal growth and development, as it provides a supportive and guiding relationship that can help individuals navigate challenges and achieve their goals.

Given material: On “Simple Things,” the outro to Nasir, Nas takes special aim at a criticism that’s plagued him for much of his career—his beat selection. “Never sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase,” he raps over a heavenly instrumental. Nas challenges that long-standing (and oft-exaggerated) flak by teaming up with Kanye West for the entirety of Nasir's seven songs. And the two music minds came up with a project that wavers between brilliant synergy and occasionally uninspired filler. Whereas the title of Nas’ previous album, 2012’s Life Is Good, is an optimistic tongue-in-cheek nod to the turmoil in Nas’ life, Nasir takes the phrase at face value. He raps about foreign delicacies. Touts his booming businesses. Boasts about making songs that grace Harvard University curriculums. On the frenzied “White Label,” he fancies himself a fashion icon (“You impressed with what they wearing, I started that,” he scoffs). Yet the best moments, however, arrive when Nas offers introspection. On “Bonjour,” Nas reflects on his privilege while Tony Williams lays immaculate vocals over a chopped loop of R.D. Burman’s “Dance Music.” “Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip/All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor/You wealthy when your kid’s upbringing better than yours,” Nas raps. The Queensbridge legend can still bend bars with the best, but where the writing of his past work is more holistic and focused in subject matter, here he offers bite-sized maxims that come across like pieced-together scrawls from his book of rhymes. Sure, they often show ingenuity—on “Everything,” he nails the succinct, “People do anything to be involved in everything/Inclusion is a hell of a drug.” But a vivid narrative like 2002’s “Get Down” or conceptual spill like 2012’s “Cherry Wine” would help to fill out a project that lacks Nas' signature storytelling or world building. Nas is a bit girl crazy on Nasir. He recaps his sexploits and stories of past and present flames. On the frenzied “White Label,” he brags about bagging “Jet’s Beauty of the Week, 1993,\\" while \\"Simple Things\\" boasts some more about his dating history. Yet it’s the woman that he doesn’t directly address—his ex-wife Kelis—that is most noticeable. About two months before Nasir's release, the singer claimed that Nas was physically abusive during their marriage of four years. Here, Nas deflects. On “Everything,” the album's sparse centerpiece, he disses journalists and bloggers (“To my life, your life pales in comparison,” he snipes) while refusing to address unnamed controversies (“Messiness is not ever the god”). On \\"Bonjour,\\" he throws a subtle dig at Kelis (“Watch who you getting pregnant, that's long-term stressing”), with whom he's been legally feuding for years. Still, Nas’ indirectness is glaring, considering the cloud that the allegations have cast over the album’s release and the candor Nas has displayed on Life Is Good. Nasir suffers from some of the same hindrances as Kanye West’s Ye. At times Nas’ free thought could be reeled in. The 070 Shake-featured “Not for Radio”—an attempt to recapture the magic and ambiance of 1999’s “Hate Me Now”—finds Nas offering questionable alternative facts about Fox News while Puff Daddy drops angry adlibs. Esco goes full anti-vaxxer on the aforementioned “Everything,” despite the conspiracy theory being disproved eight years ago. Unfortunately, Nas lacks that same passion on the propulsive, Slick Rick-sampling “Cop Shot the Kid,” as he drops impassive bars about police brutality before Kanye chimes in with “I know every story got two sides.” It’s familiar ground that both artists have handled with more depth and passion in the past (see: Nas’ “Cops Keep Firing” or his guest verses on Robin Thicke’s 2016 track, “Deep”). Nas is more thoughtful on the closer \\"Simple Things,\\" despite its abrupt ending. And he shows a passion on \\"Adam and Eve” that's missing elsewhere, as his words dance to a flawless piano loop. More of this continuity between rhymes and rhythms would help Nasir surpass good music and deliver greatness.","output":"According to the article, Nas addresses criticism of his beat selection on Nasir by stating that he has never sold a record for the beat, but rather for his verses.

Given material: Audi AG is developing a device the size of an iPad that will pack all the computing power needed for a car to drive itself without crashing. Audi's zFAS mother board will control all of the autonomous functions of the carmaker's future vehicles and process data from sensors and imagery. Audi is working with Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi to develop the various hardware and software components of an autonomous vehicle controller that will be about the size of an iPad. The driver assistance controller (zFAS) board will act as the central interface for all piloted driving functions. It is expected to go into mass production in about two years and will \\"work its way into the model range step by step in the foreseeable future,\\" Audi said. \\"It is a key milestone on the road to new, automated driving functions and a demonstration of the pioneering role that Audi is assuming in the field of piloted driving,\\" Audi said. Today, most driver assistance computer systems are a conglomeration of spatially separated controllers. Audi claims its zFAS will be the first board to control autonomous functions in a central domain architecture. The computing power of the zFAS corresponds to the complete electronics architecture of a well-equipped mid-size car, Audi said. \\"Thanks to the high degree of integration, the new board is barely the size of a tablet PC. Its modular concept makes the zFAS flexible scalable and thus future-proof in every respect,\\" Audi stated. The zFAS will process a wide range of sensor and imagery information to quickly compute a complete model of a vehicle's surroundings and make the information available to the various assistance systems. The zFAS board will be equipped with both the EyeQ3 mobile processor from Mobileye and Nvidia's new Tegra K1 mobile processor. Delphi will manufacture the zFAS board. Audi plans to pilot the new controller in the near future and will have self-driving vehicles transmit data back to the company via Audi's onboard telematics system, Audi connect. The data computed by the zFAS board will be transferred via the cellular phone network -- via LTE, where available -- to an IT backend in the cloud, the company said. \\"This will process these data using algorithms for machine learning and artificial intelligence before sending the data back to the car. The zFAS board will in this way continuously extend its capabilities to master even complex situations increasingly better,\\" Audi stated. \\"The piloted cars from Audi thus learn more every day and with each new situation they experience.\\"","output":"The zFAS (driver assistance controller) board by Audi AG is a central interface for all piloted driving functions in the company's future vehicles.

Given material: I was riding an electric mountain bike at Schweitzer Mountain Resort. I was on a two-hour guided tour of the mountain, led by Dani Demmons, activities manager for the North Idaho resort. We completed a roughly 10-mile loop that took us high up the mountain and was replete with glittering views of the lake, the deep cleaving marks of the long-ago glacial flood clearly visible. We biked along shady roads and passed pockets of wildflowers. A tree, stripped of its bark, showed where a bear had marked its territory. Idaho Stop Law allows cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign, and a red light as a stop sign. Boise Police Officer Blake Slater shows in the video how you can ride safely in Idaho. Despite the 90-degree heat, I didn’t break a sweat. ”We call it a leisurely interpretive ride,” Demmons said. The bikes, built by Rad Power Bikes, weigh 65 pounds and have fat tires, allowing riders to roll over all but the largest obstacles. Riders can pick the level of pedal assist they want, or there is a throttle that removes pedaling altogether. Schweitzer started offering the rides in July. Since then, Demmons said, the tour has attracted the kind of people you might expect, “people who don’t think they’re quite physically fit enough” to go on a full mountain bike ride. But it’s also brought out the more experienced and athletic bikers. She overcame that fear on July 8 when she did the two-hour tour with her boyfriend. The e-bike tour is more than just a fun outing. It’s a harbinger of what’s to come. The bike tour on Schweitzer Mountain is one example of how biking is changing. Worldwide, e-bike sales have skyrocketed with 35 million sold in 2016. Some economists predict the industry will account for more than 34 billion in sales by 2025. Already e-bikes are the highest-selling electric vehicle worldwide. They’re particularly popular in smog-smothered China and bike-friendly Europe. But, like all things cycling, e-bikes haven’t taken off in the United States the way they have elsewhere. According to a Bicycle Product Suppliers Association study, the U.S. e-bike industry essentially doubled from 2016 to 2017. While the numbers are still small, they will likely only continue to increase. The technology could be particularly useful in a hilly city such as Spokane. Rhonda Kae Young, a professor of civil engineering at Gonzaga University, has been using a Copenhagen Wheel since the fall. ”It just kind of makes your city level,” she said. Unlike full e-bikes such as the ones used at Schweitzer, the Copenhagen Wheel is an electric propulsion device integrated into the rear wheel of a bike. The amount of assistance a rider gets is controlled via a smartphone. The wheel can fit onto normal bikes and starts at 1,499. The prospect of e-bikes flooding the streets has alarmed some motorists and other cyclists. ”People talk about it a lot: Should e-bikes be able to use regular bike lanes?” Young said. Some worry about the bikes traveling too fast and putting cyclists and pedestrians at risk. Mariah McKay believes concerns about e-bike safety are concerns about biking etiquette. McKay, who may have been the first person in Spokane to own a Copenhagen Wheel, has been using the device for about two years. In March, Washington passed a law governing e-bikes and breaking them into three classes based primarily on speed. As for infrastructure considerations, good bike infrastructure is good e-bike infrastructure, Young said. Although McKay points out that for longer bike trips, between cities, for instance, finding places to charge the bike’s motors could be challenging. Perhaps the most important function e-bikes serve is getting more people onto two wheels. At 290 pounds, Robert Welck is a big man. He’s not the kind of guy who slips into spandex shorts and knocks out 50 miles. That’s exactly why he’s renting and selling e-bikes. Welck and his brother started Spokane Electric Bike Rental in 2017. Their goal is to make biking more accessible. They don’t manufacture their bikes, but they design them with an eye toward heavier riders. The bikes cost between 1,000 and 2,500. Rentals cost 50 a day. Rental payments go toward the bike purchase. ”Our niche is someone who hasn’t ridden in a long time and someone who is heavy,” Welck said. For Welck, e-bikes have four main selling points: They connect you to a time in your life when things were simpler; they provide some exercise; they’re good for the environment; and they’re cheap. Schweitzer Mountain Resort executives likely weren’t considering the bigger biking picture when they started offering e-bike tours. Instead, they saw a cool recreation opportunity, one that could open the mountain to people who might not otherwise get out and see it. Yet the recreational tour may have have pushed some inadvertently into the e-bike fan club.","output":"The Idaho Stop Law and similar laws impact e-bike usage and safety by allowing cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs and red lights as stop signs. The main benefits of these laws are that they enable e-bike users to navigate through traffic more efficiently while maintaining awareness of their surroundings. As e-bike popularity grows, it is vital for cyclists to adhere to safety measures and proper biking etiquette when sharing the road with motorists and pedestrians. E-bikes have the potential to increase the number of people using bicycles for transportation and recreation, encouraging a healthier and more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Good bike infrastructure benefits both traditional cyclists and e-bike users, although finding charging stations for longer trips could be challenging. Overall, laws like the Idaho Stop Law aim to accommodate the growing presence of e-bikes in public spaces while promoting safety for all road users."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: How has Israel's decision to close off the territories affected the economic situation in the area, as mentioned in the Secretary-General's statement?

Given material: CHELSEA owner Roman Abramovich has loaned the club a monster £1bn. That's according to the financial reports of the company through which the Russian owns the club. Fordstam confirmed that the interest-free loan has surpassed the £1bn mark of the first time. The figure has risen from £984m the year before to an eye-watering £1,041,243,000 up to last June. Within the terms of the loan Abramovich has the right to demand that the money is paid back within 18 months, however that situation is extremely unlikely to arise. For the time being at least. In the financial report, Fordstam’s Paul Heagren reported: \\"The company has received confirmation from the ultimate controlling party that sufficient funds will be provided to finance the business for the foreseeable future.\\" Abramovich bought the club in 2003 and bankrolled an unprecedented period of success for the club. With Jose Mourinho back as manager for a second time, Chelsea have got their hands back on the Premier League trophy for the first time in five years.","output":"Roman Abramovich's ownership of Chelsea FC has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the club's success over the years. His loan of £1 billion has provided the club with the financial resources necessary to invest in top-class players and infrastructure, allowing Chelsea to dominate the Premier League and win numerous titles. Under Abramovich's ownership, Chelsea has enjoyed an unprecedented period of success, including five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and three League Cups. The club has also invested heavily in youth development, establishing a highly regarded academy that has produced many talented players who have gone on to excel in the first team. Abramovich's financial backing has also allowed Chelsea to build a state-of-the-art training ground and stadium, which has provided the team with the best possible facilities to train and compete. This investment has helped to attract and retain top talent, as players are drawn to the club's world-class facilities and ambition to win. While the loan has surpassed the £1 billion mark, it is unlikely that Abramovich will demand repayment of the loan in the near future. The financial report from Fordstam confirms that the ultimate controlling party has provided sufficient funds to finance the business for the foreseeable future, allowing Chelsea to continue to invest in the team and pursue success on the pitch. In conclusion, Roman Abramovich's ownership of Chelsea FC has been a major factor in the club's success over the years, providing the necessary financial resources to invest in top players and infrastructure and helping to establish the club as one of the premier teams in English football."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: How has the community responded to the incident and what impact has it had on the town of Madison, Alabama? Given material: Former police officer Eric Sloan Parker pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of violating the civil rights of an Indian grandfather, left partially paralyzed after officers slammed him to the ground during a February arrest. Appearing before the federal magistrate in Huntsville, Alabama, Parker entered a plea of “not guilty” to the charge of felony civil rights abuse, brought against him by the FBI last month. If convicted, he could face 10 years in prison. The 26-year-old former police officer from Madison, Alabama also faces a misdemeanor assault charge in Limestone County, which could put him in jail for up to a year. Parker is currently free on a 5000 bond, and will face trial on June 1. A civil case against him by the family of the injured man has been put on hold until the criminal proceedings are resolved. Madison police released recordings of a call reporting a “skinny black guy” with a knit cap walking around an affluent neighborhood and peering into garages, on February 6 in the morning. Parker and two other officers approached the man, later identified as Sureshbhai Patel, 57. An Indian national who came to Alabama to help his son and daughter-in-law with their firstborn, Patel only spoke Gujarati, and tried to tell the officers he was minding his own business. “No English. Indian. Walking,” he said, according to his son Chirag’s statement to the local media at the time. Dashboard camera footage released by the police shows Parker slamming Patel on the ground. Suffering a neck injury from the impact, Patel was unable to move on his own and was taken to the hospital. Doctors said that without the emergency surgery he would have been permanently paralyzed, Chirag Patel later told AL.com. Sureshbhai Patel had no health insurance, but a GoFundMe.com campaign established to pay for his medical expenses has raised nearly 210,000. His recovery has been slow and painful, the family says. Madison is a town of about 46,000 people in northern Alabama, 10 miles west of Huntsville, and is known for high-tech, aerospace and defense industry. The TechAmerica foundation lists Huntsville/Madison County as the second-highest concentration of high-tech workers in the US, after California’s Silicon Valley.","output":"The community of Madison, Alabama has been affected significantly by the incident involving former police officer Eric Sloan Parker and Indian grandfather Sureshbhai Patel.

Given material: Patriots free agency 2019: Which players could New England lose this offseason? The New England Patriots' run to a sixth Super Bowl title wasn't easy from the outset. But by the time they took on the Los Angeles Rams, they'd put together a powerful run game, tricky passing attack and a defense that managed to smother one of the NFL's top offenses. So how much of that team is coming back in 2019? That's the question the team faces as free agency approaches. As things stand, the Patriots have many of their franchises cornerstones under contract like Julian Edelman, Stephon Gilmore and Shaq Mason. Rob Gronkowski and Tom Brady are under contract, too. But that hasn't really killed speculation that they could retire this offense. They're not alone, either. Then there's the whole class of players set to hit free agency in just a couple of months as well as those who could be cut or traded due to cap reasons. This offseason could see a whole lot of turnover for the Patriots. Here's every player who's at risk of not returning in 2019. Gostkowski has been the man on the field goal unit for the Patriots for 13 seasons now. But at age 35, he's starting to get up there. With that said, kickers are playing longer than ever -- just ask 46-year-old Adam Vinatieri. Gostkowski missed one kick, but made the one the Patriots needed to lock up a victory in Super Bowl LIII. Unless something changes, it seems likely that the two sides work out a renewed deal for 2019. There is also a possibility the Patriots could place the franchise tag on Gostkowski, which would prevent him from ever hitting the open market. Both sides would also get additional time to work on a long-term deal. Hogan's had an interesting career with the Patriots. There have been times when he's been on the cusp of breaking out and times where he's struggled to get the ball. While he was effective at times in 2018 Hogan was inconsistent and had long stretches where he wasn't a factor in the offense. At age 30, his long-term value on the free agent market remains unclear. If another team tries to cash in on his success with the Patriots -- like the Miami Dolphins did with Danny Amendola -- the Patriots could be outbid. But if there are no takers, he could return on a moderate deal. Chances he leaves: \\"Zero percent\\" Brady has pretty much cleared it up, but the speculation of a potential retirement for the six-time Super Bowl champion lingers. Brady will be 42 years old by the time the season starts and will have already set a new standard for excellence in the NFL. By any stretch of the imagination, he's accomplished everything a player could wish for in a career. Still, Brady said that there's \\"zero percent\\" chance he retires this offseason and that he wants to play until he's 45, or until his performance falls. Gronkowski's case is less clear than Brady's. There was heavy speculation that he might walk away after the 2017 season. Reports coming out seem to hint that Gronkowski is closer than ever to choosing to walk away. However, he has reportedly been spotted at Gillette Stadium multiple times in recent weeks. After the Super Bowl, Gronkowski said that he'd take a week or two to make his decision about 2019. Until that time comes, Gronkowski is a wild card for the Patriots this upcoming season.","output":"Based on the given material, it is likely that Stephen Gostkowski will return to the New England Patriots in 2019. While he is 35 years old and has been the team's kicker for 13 seasons, he has been consistent and reliable throughout his career. The Patriots have also shown a history of retaining their key players, including Gostkowski, who has been under contract with the team since 2009. Additionally, the team has not shown any indication of letting him go, with the franchise tag being a possibility to prevent him from ever hitting the open market. Therefore, it is likely that Gostkowski will return to the Patriots in 2019. As for Hogan, his future with the Patriots is uncertain. While he has had some successful moments with the team, he has also struggled to find consistency in his play. At 30 years old, his long-term value on the free agent market remains unclear, and if another team were to offer him a better deal, the Patriots could be outbid.

Given material: Don't put yours in the basement! With the approach of the Atlantic Hurricane Season, which brings the possibility of power failures in affected areas, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is urging consumers to take steps to safeguard their families when using a portable generator. If your power is out due to a hurricane, or for any reason, operating your generator safely can mean the difference between life and death. The exhaust from generators contains poisonous carbon monoxide, an odorless, invisible killer. \\"The amount of carbon monoxide from one generator is equivalent to hundreds of idling cars,\\" said CPSC Chairman Hal Stratton. \\"Carbon monoxide from a portable generator can kill you and your family in minutes.\\" In 2005, at least 55 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning associated with portable generators. The aftermath of last year's four major hurricanes resulted in a majority (28) of those deaths. CPSC urges consumers to follow these safety tips when operating a portable generator after a storm or other event that has caused a power outage. • Never use a portable generator indoors, including in your home, garage, basement, crawlspace, shed or partially enclosed area -- even with ventilation. Opening doors and windows or using fans will not prevent CO buildup in the home. • Use a portable generator outdoors only in a dry area far away from doors, windows and vents that can allow CO to come indoors. • Install battery-operated CO alarms or plug-in CO alarms with battery backup in your home. Test the alarms frequently and replace dead batteries. • Get to fresh air right away if you start to feel dizzy or weak. The CO from generators can rapidly lead to full incapacitation and death. • Plug appliances into a heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords and plug the cords into the generator. • If you are concerned about theft, secure your generator outside. To reach consumers with this lifesaving information, CPSC has developed new warning labels for newly manufactured generators. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) has adopted the same labels in its new procedure for certifying portable generators. Any manufacturer that wants the UL certification will have to place the new warning label on its generators. Generators must also have ground fault circuit interrupters to prevent electrocution if they get wet. CPSC Chairman Stratton said, \\"If we can keep people from using a generator indoors, in a partially-enclosed area or anywhere close to their home, these labels have done their job.\\" Home electrical generators: Which kind is right for you?","output":"According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in 2005, at least 55 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning associated with portable generators. This number includes those who put their generators in the basement, which is not a safe location. It is important to always use a portable generator outdoors in a dry area, far away from doors, windows, and vents. Additionally, make sure to install CO alarms in your home and get to fresh air immediately if you start to feel dizzy or weak. Remember to always follow safety precautions when using a generator, as it can be a lifesaving tool during power outages."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: How might the person's symptoms impact their academic performance and personal life?

Given material: Moderator Alex Trebek speaks during a gubernatorial debate between Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Republican Scott Wagner in Hershey , Pa., Monday, Oct. 1, 2018. The debate was hosted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. It's hard to decisively win a 45-minute gubernatorial debate: There's simply not enough time to make key points and thoroughly own the issues. But you can certainly lose the debate, especially if you're the moderator. That's what happened Monday night at the Hershey Lodge, when Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek made a guest appearance as celebrity moderator of Pennsylvania's one and only debate between Gov. Wolf, a Democrat, and Republican Scott Wagner. The debate started late as Trebek lingered on stage during a \\"fireside chat\\" with Gene Barr, president of the state Chamber of Business and Industry, which hosted the event. Then, when the main event finally came, the game-show host filibustered and monopolized the whole thing — which seemed fine to the front-runner Wolf but cut into Wagner's attempt to capitalize on a statewide audience for the lone debate. Trebek abandoned a veneer of impartiality when it came to whether Pennsylvania should impose a severance tax on natural gas drilling. Wolf has pushed the tax since he took office in 2015, but the GOP-led legislature has blocked his efforts. Wagner and other Republicans note that Pennsylvania already imposes an \\"impact fee\\" on drillers. Wagner marshaled that argument Monday, but Trebek suggested it wasn't enough. That was a remarkably unpopular opinion to push to the Chamber of Business and Industry crowd, which responded with boos. \\"What did I tell you guys at the beginning?\\" Trebek said (his one rule: no booing or hissing). \\"If all of the voters were to believe everything you've said about each other, we'd have trouble voting for either one of you,\\" Trebek told the candidates. Fair enough — voters often say they're sick of attack ads. But Trebek came across as moralizing, and it's not clear why his opinion should matter to Pennsylvania voters. At one point, Trebek asked: \\"Have you ever said anything negative about your opponent that you knew was not true?\\" Wagner shook his head no, and Wolf offered a lawyerlike equivocation: \\"Not that I remember, no.\\" Trebek began to frame a question about redistricting, noting that the legislature had made scores of amendments to a reform bill and suggesting lawmakers had no interest in actually changing the process. Then he said the only institution less popular in the Keystone State than the legislature was the Catholic Church, which, of course, has been under fire since a grand jury in August reported decades of abuse by predator priests. The audience seemed to let out an audible cringe. \\"Don't go there,\\" Trebek said, before launching into a soliloquy about his time at a Catholic boarding school. As Trebek moved on, Wolf interjected, to laughter, \\"I don't think you quite finished on the redistricting.\\" The Pennsylvania Cable Network is not the place for this. If you watch PCN, you're expecting the sometimes dry and technical but important details of state government policy debate. Callers to a post-debate review show were aghast at Trebek's performance, no matter which gubernatorial candidate they supported.","output":"Trebek's performance as the moderator of the gubernatorial debate had a significant impact on the post-debate reactions of viewers. His late start and prolonged \\"fireside chat\\" with the president of the Chamber of Business and Industry caused frustration among the audience and cut into Scott Wagner's opportunity to reach a statewide audience. Additionally, Trebek's lack of impartiality on the issue of a severance tax on natural gas drilling and his moralizing tone during the debate raised eyebrows and drew boos from the crowd. His personal opinions and tangents, such as mentioning the Catholic Church scandal, were seen as inappropriate and detracted from the focus on important policy issues. Viewers, regardless of their support for either candidate, expressed their dissatisfaction with Trebek's performance during post-debate reviews. This could potentially influence the upcoming election by shaping public opinion and affecting how voters perceive the candidates."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: In what ways does Arroyo suggest that the US's preoccupation with the Middle East has led to a leadership vacuum in the Asian region, and how have China and Japan responded? Given material: MANILA, JUNE 25, 2007 (STAR) By Des Ferriols - Japan should play a leading role in promoting the integration and security of East Asia, President Arroyo said here yesterday. In opening remarks to the World Economic Forum on East Asia, Mrs. Arroyo said the leadership obligations of China and India were also increasing as their political and economic clout grew. “As the region’s largest source of official development assistance, Japan will provide leadership to the important arena of sustainable development,” Mrs. Arroyo said. The President said Japan should play a leading role in contributing to integration in the region, and maintaining and pursuing international peace and security in the East Asia community. Japan, China and India are active in the East Asia Summit, which promotes community building and a political, economic and security dialogue between ASEAN and its regional partners. “As China and India become true political and economic giants, their leadership obligations to their neighbors also increase, separate from their obligations to their own citizens,” Mrs. Arroyo said. Mrs. Arroyo pointed out the region has seen increasing integration and prosperity in recent years and this would impact on how the region intended to contemplate the next few decades. However, this integration and growth was accompanied by the likelihood of greater income disparity, she said. “We see a more peaceful world and yet more countries with nuclear capability,” Mrs. Arroyo said. Mrs. Arroyo said the US has been preoccupied in the Middle East, leaving a widely-perceived leadership vacuum in the Asian region. “It has left the impression that there is a political opening for others such as China and Japan to fill,” Mrs. Arroyo said. China and Japan have “stepped up their game,” notably over the crisis on the Korean peninsula, she said. China and Japan are among six nations which have held talks aimed at resolving a standoff over North Korea’s nuclear program. Mrs. Arroyo said the real issue is how the region would handle itself in the next 20 to 40 years. Mrs. Arroyo also mentioned the unpopular tax reform packages passed by lawmakers led by Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. which resulted in lifting the Philippine economy. At a dinner on the eve of the two-day World Economic Forum in Singapore, Mrs. Arroyo told her counterparts of the effort of lawmakers to enact reform legislation that included the Expanded Value Added Tax (EVAT) which enabled the Philippines to start rebuilding its human and physical infrastructure to make it a global and regional competitor. She said the government is now investing in basic education, public health care and mass housing to enhance its human infrastructure and is building a network of roads, bridges, airports, seaports, and irrigation badly needed by surging foreign investments and global tourism. At the same time, Mrs. Arroyo applauded the proposal for an anti-terrorism coalition that De Venecia had submitted before the Cabinet immediately after the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States. She said the anti-terror coalition eventually became a Philippine initiative that brought together Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines in a common fight against global and regional terrorism. The coalition was later expanded to include Thailand, Cambodia and Australia.","output":"Arroyo suggests that the US's preoccupation with the Middle East has led to a leadership vacuum in the Asian region in several ways. Firstly, she points out that the US has been focused on the Middle East, leaving a widely-perceived leadership vacuum in the Asian region. This has created an opportunity for other countries such as China and Japan to step up and take on leadership roles. Secondly, Arroyo notes that the increasing integration and prosperity in the region has also created a leadership vacuum. As the region becomes more interconnected and economically powerful, there is a growing expectation that it should take on a more significant role in global affairs. However, this is complicated by the fact that the region is also becoming more diverse and complex, with a greater range of political, economic, and security challenges to address. Finally, Arroyo highlights the challenges posed by the increasing integration and prosperity in the region. While the region has seen significant economic growth and development in recent years, this has also led to greater income disparity and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These challenges require a concerted effort from all countries in the region to address, and Arroyo suggests that China and Japan are stepping up to take on this leadership role. In response to the leadership vacuum, China and Japan have \\"stepped up their game,\\" particularly in the context of the Korean peninsula crisis. Arroyo notes that China and Japan are among the six nations that have held talks aimed at resolving the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program. This demonstrates their willingness to take on a more active role in regional affairs and to work together to address common challenges. Overall, Arroyo suggests that the US's preoccupation with the Middle East has created a leadership vacuum in the Asian region, but that China and Japan are stepping up to take on this role. She emphasizes the need for all countries in the region to work together to address the challenges posed by increasing integration and prosperity, and to ensure that the region remains peaceful, stable, and secure in the face of global challenges."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: Paraphrasing and Polishing: Restate the reason why Lutz retired from General Motors, and explain why this might have been surprising to some people. Given material: Bob Lutz, one of the auto industry's most charismatic executives, has officially retired from the car business, marking the end of a career that included stints at BMW, Chrysler and, finally, General Motors. Popular Mechanics caught up with Lutz at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich., for this exclusive interview. When General Motors vice chairman Bob Lutz announced in February that he would be retiring this May—at age 78—speculation mounted that the legendary product chief wasn't getting along with Ed Whitacre, Jr., GM's new chairman and CEO. \\"It's quite the opposite,\\" Lutz said. \\"But the restructuring of the company didn't leave me with a clear or logical role, and I'm not one of the company's young up-and-comers either.\\" When Lutz joined GM in September 2001, it followed a meeting with then-CEO Rick Wagoner, who recognized that the company's product and design departments were dysfunctional, and asked Lutz to help him identify \\"the next Bob Lutz.\\" Wagoner's question implied that Lutz was not just an executive, but a brand unto himself. \\"The importance of Lutz to GM and to the other companies he has worked for is not so much in specific products and models,\\" says Jim Hall of 2953 Analytics and a former member of GM's design department. \\"It's in his ability to move an entire culture through the force of his personality and talent.\\" Lutz, first and foremost, is seen as a car guy. The 400-acre Lutz farm in Ann Arbor includes a garage that houses some of his collectibles: a 1950s-era Aston Martin that belonged to his father, a Cunningham C3 and C4R, a 1934 Reilly Roadster, two Dodge Vipers, and a 1976 Pinzgauer from Austria's Steyr-Daimler-Puch. Though Lutz is, for the first time, showing his age by way of a guarded and slightly crooked gait due to major back surgery last year, he clearly hasn't finished talking, teaching, or even flying his German Alpha fighter jet. The distinctive gravelly voice sounds road-weary, possibly the result of too many cigars, martinis, homemade pear schnapps and heated arguments with CEOs. It's a voice that will be missed, though it will hardly disappear as he charts the course for a book and speaking tour to help make up for evaporated stock options and pension payments from bankrupted Chrysler and GM. Lutz is leaving, he says, with a strong sense that the work he began in 2001—when he was brought in to reform a product-development culture that had delivered the unpopular Pontiac Aztek and Saturn Ion—has paid off, and the right people are in place to carry it on. As proof, he recounted an episode at GM last month that gives him peace of mind. He was participating in a meeting about a new manual transmission for GM's passenger cars in Europe and Asia, where stick shifts are still relevant. The plan calls for a huge upgrade, but two representatives from the finance department offered a damning assessment of how many more vehicles GM would have to sell to pay for the higher cost. \\"I thought to myself that the forces of evil have not yet been vanquished,\\" Lutz said. Whitacre asked Lutz the same week how he felt about retiring. \\"Terrible,\\" said Lutz, who then related the story of the manual transmission. But what gives the outgoing vice chairman solace was that Whitacre and new chief financial officer Chris Liddell, who came to GM from Microsoft, were as appalled as Lutz that finance was trying to undercut an attempt by product development to take a leadership position on a piece of important technology. \\"They understood the problem immediately, began debriefing me on the session, and started reorienting the people who for some reason were still clinging to the ways of the old GM,\\" Lutz says. Indeed, products that are closely associated with Lutz have been successful on the margins of the showroom: Dodge's Viper; Pontiac's GTO, G8 and Solstice; and the Chevrolet Volt. His impact has been felt the most in the overall upgrade of products across the board, especially the quality of design and materials inside the cars. \\"Bob's biggest contribution has been the way he has educated people about the power and profitability of simple good taste,\\" says Ed Welburn, head of design at GM. \\"Cars like the Malibu, the Buick LaCrosse, and the Cadillac CTS are successful because they look and feel the way great cars should look and feel, and he was the one who turned the thinking of the company in that direction—to not reduce everything to cost analysis.\\" Nevertheless, Lutz maintains he prevailed precisely because of his cost analysis. GM's finance department had degenerated under Jack Smith and Rick Wagoner, wringing money out of product development with little attention paid to how much of the money saved would have to be given away in the form of incentives and rebates, not to mention at the back end of lease deals because the resale values of GM's vehicles had fallen. \\"The thinking I brought here was this: If we can put 1000 more goodness in each vehicle, and reduce the incentive spent from 4000 a car to 2000, we are 1000 per car ahead. And that is in effect what has happened.\\" GM has since invested money in sound-deadening materials, suspensions, and better interiors. \\"That's the kind of stuff that finance guys love to force you to take out, but it costs the enterprise a lot more to dumb the products down.\\" Lutz admits he's a bit surprised that consumers came back to Buick, Cadillac, Chevy and GMC so soon after GM's Chapter 11 filing last year. Conventional wisdom was that people wouldn't buy from a bankrupt car company. Research shows, however, that relatively few consumers make a direct connection between the brands and the parent company. \\"It comes through in the interviews and the surveys,\\" says Lutz. \\"They hate GM but love Chevrolet.\\" The culture that Lutz has been attempting to change at GM is what he calls \\"the typical American business school\\" approach, which he feels has hamstrung Detroit more than anything else. It's a topic he plans to address at length in an upcoming book he is authoring. The business school approach dictates that the product is just part of the picture—and not the most important part. \\"And that is the thinking that led to such mediocrity of product,\\" Lutz says. Throughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s—when graduates of the Harvard Business School began populating the Big Three—to identify someone as a car guy was a slur. \\"Bob made it OK to be a car guy again,\\" says Jack Keebler, advanced concepts group director at GM. There is one thing Lutz wants to set straight about GM's record over the last nine years: In 2006, Kirk Kerkorian bought a stake in GM and installed Jerry York, Lutz's old colleague from Chrysler, on the board. York tried to orchestrate an alliance between Renault-Nissan and GM. \\"Some people think we were shortsighted or stupid for not doing that,\\" he says. \\"The truth is it was a great deal for Renault-Nissan, which stood to gain around 16 billion a year in savings, mostly from purchasing and such, and GM would have gained about 2 billion in cost savings, and we were supposed to give them a big chunk of equity for that,\\" Lutz says. \\"It was a bad deal [for GM].\\" Under CEO Henderson's brief tenure, Lutz was put in charge of marketing. The dirty secret, he says, is that \\"I am not a product designer or engineer.\\" Besides being a former Marine pilot, Lutz got his business school degree in marketing, and was, in the early 1970s, the board member in charge of marketing at BMW AG. It was on Lutz's watch that the company adopted \\"The Ultimate Driving Machine\\" slogan in the U.S. Lutz convinced the Germans that it was madness for the company to make millionaires of outside sales companies while BMW sold them product at cost. In his brief stint as marketing chief at GM, Lutz's contribution was breaking down the budget walls between marketing, communications and design so that the best ideas get the money they deserve. Lutz has no qualms about shuttering Pontiac, Saturn and Hummer, and selling Saab. He suggested selling or closing Saab in his first year at GM. Saturn, he says, finally got a world-class product lineup, but \\"it was going to take too long for the public to recognize that.\\" Hummer became a liability as the poster brand for planetary destruction.\\" Pontiac, he contends, became the symbol for GM's management failure, because no other brand suffered as much from the system by which the general manager was given power to completely change the brand strategy and product plan. \\"One general manager bought in the idea that Pontiac should be made up of rear-drive performance-oriented cars, and then another would come in and decide that Pontiac should be transformed into a small-car division to compete against Toyota's Scion brand.\\" Now, he says, such planning is concentrated at the top, and Mark Reuss, GM North America president, will not allow whole strategies to be upended by middle managers. The recent reorganization at GM, in fact, did away with brand general managers and has sales executives reporting up to Reuss and brand marketers reporting to marketing chief Susan Docherty. \\"Bob's impact at GM has been enormous. I'm not sure we'd be here today without him,\\" Reuss says. Today, adds Reuss, the brand and product strategies for Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC are \\"anchored in concrete.\\" Reuss is also an engineer who Lutz identified early on in his tenure as a car guy. In fact, Reuss is the heir apparent to Lutz as far as carrying forward the cultural changes Lutz has tried to effect at GM. \\"He moves fast, and hated the focus on process that gripped the old company,\\" Lutz says of Ruess. \\"He's the person most like me in the company.\\" Mr. Wagoner's question, in other words, may have finally been answered.","output":"Bob Lutz, one of the most influential figures in the auto industry, has officially retired from General Motors. This may come as a surprise to some, as Lutz was known for his charismatic leadership and successful career at BMW, Chrysler, and finally, GM. In an exclusive interview with Popular Mechanics, Lutz explained that his retirement was not due to any conflicts with GM's new chairman and CEO, Ed Whitacre, Jr., but rather because the restructuring of the company did not leave him with a clear role. However, Lutz's impact on GM's culture and products will not be forgotten. He was brought in to reform the dysfunctional product and design departments, and his ability to move an entire culture through his personality and talent was unparalleled. Lutz's passion for cars was evident in his personal collection, which includes a variety of rare and unique vehicles. Despite his age and recent back surgery, Lutz is not slowing down and plans to continue writing and speaking about the industry. He leaves GM with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that the company's product development has greatly improved under his leadership. Lutz's influence can be seen in successful models such as the Dodge Viper, Pontiac GTO, and Chevrolet Volt, as well as the overall upgrade in design and quality of GM's vehicles. He also played a crucial role in changing the company's mindset from a cost-focused approach to one that values good taste and quality. Lutz's departure may have surprised some, but his legacy at GM will continue through the work of his successor, Mark Reuss, who shares Lutz's passion for cars and determination to change the company's culture. Lutz's impact on GM will not be forgotten, and his retirement marks the end of an era for the auto industry."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: Provide examples of people who have been indicted in Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion and the Trump campaign.

But far from top tips on how to juggle changing two sets of nappies, Beckham's advice was simple ant to the point - get more sleep before the baby arrives. 'Get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step,' said Beckham during an appearance on ITV's Lorraine, who then confessed that going from two to three was an even bigger leap. The Duchess, who is currently suffering from acute morning sickness, is thought to want three children by the age of 35. Beckham's words of support came as Kensington Palace announced that the Duchess will not be attending tonight's Invictus Games opening ceremony and that her trip to Malta next week is 'under review'. Kate, who suffered from the same extreme morning sickness during her last pregnancy, is expected to give birth in the Spring. Beckham, who has known the Duke of Cambridge for a number of years and was a guest at the Royal Wedding in 2011, is also in the running to be a godparent for the couple's second child.

Other favourites include Prince Harry, Pippa Middleton, Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall. Long shots include David Cameron and Boris Johnson at 66/1. Godfather or not, Beckham also revealed that he was left delighted by the royal baby news and said that the couple are 'great parents'. 'I’m so happy for them both because they’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have, as important as they have, is really incredible,' he said.

Given material: De Pere Police officers began pursuing the man shortly before noon Monday. DE PERE - An erratic driver led authorities on a two-county chase early Monday afternoon that ended with the man being subdued by a police dog. De Pere Police officers were alerted to the 58-year-old man's reckless driving as he headed northbound on Interstate 41 at 11:51 a.m., a De Pere Police news release stated. Officers tried to stop the man by using lights and sirens, but he kept driving. When officers attempted to box the man in he rammed a police car and continued driving at speeds up to 95 mph. The man made it to I-41 near East Stiles Tower Road in Oconto County where police had laid down spike strips that deflated at least one of his car's tires. According to Oconto Sheriff Chief Deputy Ed Janke, the man was not cooperative once his car stopped around 12:20 p.m. \\"A K-9 unit was deployed and the subject was taken into custody,\\" Janke said in an interview. The driver is expected to face several charges in Brown County Circuit Court, according to the De Pere Police Department's release.","output":"Based on the given material, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the suspect refused to stop his vehicle despite repeated attempts by the police to pull him over due to his intent to evade being caught for reckless driving. This reasoning can be derived from the reports of police pursuing the suspect immediately after he was identified for driving erratically on Interstate 41. The suspect intentionally disregarded the police's attempts to stop him by using lights and sirens, and instead opted to flee, even when police officers attempted to box him in. The progression of the chase, which involved the suspect ramming a police car and continuing to drive at high speeds, further reinforces this initial hypothesis. Upon being confronted with spike strips, which deflated at least one of the car's tires, the suspect was not cooperative even after his vehicle came to a stop. This lack of cooperation led to the deployment of a K-9 unit, which ultimately resulted in the suspect's apprehension. These actions by the suspect could be indicative of a desire to avoid legal consequences for his previous conduct, thereby bolstering the conclusion that he refused to stop the vehicle to escape the police's attention."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: Translate the article into Spanish and summarize the key points about the exhibitions. Given material: Visitors look at wreckage of a downed US Air force aircraft on display at the Vietnam Military History Museum in Hanoi on December 19. Several exhibitions mark the 40th anniversary of Vietnam's repulse of the US's Christmas campaign to bomb Hanoi. One has opened at the Vietnam Military History Museum in Hanoi with nearly 300 artifacts and photos, many of them displayed for the first time ever. The artifacts include the engine of a B-52 bomber that was shot down over Ngoc Ha flower village, a piece of another B-52 shot down in Chuom rice field in Soc Son District, and several objects belonging to American pilots. There is a scale used to weigh children at the Uy No Commune Medical Station which was bombed in the campaign, torn children's clothes, and vessels and other kitchen ware belonging to people who were injured or killed. Another exhibition is being held at VietArt Center, 42 Yet Kieu Street, with 40 paintings by Truong Sinh, many done during the 12 days of the bombing campaign. Sinh said he hopes the paintings, reflecting the willingness of Hanoi residents to fight the invaders, would help younger generations learn about an important milestone in the country's history and instill patriotism in them. In December 1972 US President Richard Nixon ordered an intensive bombing of Hanoi by deploying a large number of B-52 Stratofortress aircraft. During the 12-day campaign, starting on December 18, the US Air Force and Navy made 729 B-52 sorties and nearly 4,000 tactical aircraft sorties to drop 80,000 tons of bombs on North Vietnam, especially Hanoi and Hai Phong. Half of them were dropped on Hanoi, many hitting densely populated areas. Hanoi forced down 34 of the B-52s.","output":"El artículo habla sobre varias exposiciones que conmemoran el 40 aniversario de la repulsión de la campaña navideña de bombardeo de Hanoi por parte de Estados Unidos.

Given material: Those who claim there are too many bowl games can rejoice. There won't be any more bowl games added to the postseason slate anytime soon. According to ESPN's Brett McMurphy, the NCAA has put a halt to the addition of new bowl games and shattered the dreams of Austin, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina—all of which were in the process of adding games. That's unfortunate, because the idea that there are too many bowl games already is simply false. There's no such thing as \\"too many bowl games. Sure, pundits will complain, as many did on Monday morning. NCAA wising up limiting bowl games. Too many exhibitions already. Stars will soon stop playing in them anyway. Before you hit the comment section and immediately complain about 5-7 teams making bowl games and mediocre teams receiving participation trophies, take a step back and truly understand what bowl games are. They are rewards to student-athletes. If you want to label that as a participation trophy, fine. But in your next sentence, you can't complain that players aren't compensated enough for playing college football. Players often receive a trip to an exotic destination during bowl week; get to have new and different experiences with their teammates (for free, incidentally); receive a swag bag that contains the latest and greatest in gaming, technology and apparel; and receive a handsome per diem on site and for travel (which is often pooled together by several players in order to save a little extra). Bowls are a legal form of player compensation—and the compensation distributed is much more tangible than athletic scholarships. I ask you, Mr. Bowl Cynic, do you want to take that away from student-athletes? If you do, you better not complain that they don't get paid enough. Those two points can't co-exist. What's more, bowls are made-for-TV events that dominate a three-week schedule over the holiday season. If you don't care about watching the GoDaddy Bowl between Georgia Southern and Bowling Green on a Wednesday night in December, that's fine. Others will, though. Specifically, 2.335 million people did in 2015, according to Sports Media Watch. For comparison, the 2016 MLB Opening Day World Series rematch between the Royals and Mets on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball drew 2.9 million. A World Series rematch on Opening Day—one of the most exciting days in Major League Baseball—only outdrew a \\"meaningless weeknight bowl game\\" between two Group of Five teams by a half-million people. The Las Vegas, Sun, Foster Farms, Pinstripe, Independence, Texas, Russell Athletic, Music City, Holiday, Belk, Citrus, Alamo, Liberty, Gator, Cactus and all New Year's Six bowls outdrew the marquee matchup on MLB's Opening Day. You might not be watching, but others are. What's more, strict bowl game qualification standards actually drive a bigger wedge between the college football \\"haves and have nots.\\" If a team misses one, it misses out on those all-important 15 bowl practices that help develop players—particularly younger players who don't get the chance to work with the first- and-second teams during the season. The teams that make bowls accelerate that development process by taking advantage of that practice time. Is that a reward for teams that finish .500 or above (or, at least close considering three 5-7 teams made bowl last year)? Sure. But it's also a punishment for those that don't make it, which shouldn't be the case. The latter is the more important aspect of the qualification standard because it makes the former more difficult to attain. In this day and age, the comparable reward to a bowl game in the 1970's is a College Football Playoff berth or, perhaps more accurately, a New Year's Six appearance. The other bowls are exhibitions that are meant to be fun, and more fun in the game is good for everybody. Plus, the three cities that were in the mix for new bowl games would be fantastic additions to the bowl schedule. Charleston and Myrtle Beach are great coastal cities with beaches and plenty of entertainment options, and Austin's nightlife is second to none in the Lone Star State.

Teams that qualify get the opportunity to have 15 additional practices, which are crucial for player development, especially for younger players. This can be seen as a reward for teams that perform well during the season. However, it can also be seen as a punishment for teams that do not qualify, as they miss out on these additional practices.

Given material: At a conference this week, members of law enforcement, aviation, aerospace and medicine discussed how cops can learn from others' mistakes. The emergency landing of a U.S. Airways flight in the Hudson River in 2009 inspired a film starring Tom Hanks and was deemed the \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\" because no one aboard died. Passengers and pilots alike cheered the outcome. But officials at the National Transportation Safety Board also reviewed what went wrong, knowing it was only a matter of time before birds would get sucked into the engines of another plane and disable it. There was no guarantee of another happy ending. That's the approach the NTSB takes every time a plane crashes. This week, officials from that agency as well as medical and aerospace experts came together with local and national law enforcement professionals to discuss whether a similar process could reduce the number of people who die in encounters between police and the public. The conference, sponsored by The Johnson Foundation at Wingspread and the University of Wisconsin Law School, was the first step in designing a statewide system for law enforcement to learn from past incidents. It would be modeled on those of other professions that carry life-and-death risk. The NTSB reviews not only incidents that end in injury or death but also those that result in extensive damage to aircraft with the ambitious goal of eliminating adverse events, said Acting Managing Director Sharon W. Bryson, who shared the agency's process with the 30 attendees at the conference. \\"We would all like to be able to get to zero ... and law enforcement would also like to get to that point where no law enforcement members or members of the community are injured or killed,\\" said Bryson, whose husband is a police officer. Bell was the driving force behind a first-of-its-kind Wisconsin law that requires outside entities to lead investigations into officer-involved deaths here. A system for examining and sharing the factors that contributed to an incident with an eye toward prevention is the next step, said Cecelia Klingele, associate professor at the UW law school. \\"A key feature of a good review system ... is the recognition that we have to be focused on helping people prevent future incidents rather than blaming people for past mistakes,\\" she said. It would not replace methods already in place to hold officers accountable for misconduct, she said. The focus on using past incidents as teaching tools has gained traction in recent years in light of a number of high-profile police-involved deaths, including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York. Lt. Timothy Leitzke, who works in internal affairs at the Milwaukee Police Department, said such a review system could go a long way toward restoring the public's trust in law enforcement, which has eroded over the past year or so. \\"We have to be part of the process that says, 'Hey, we’re always putting our best foot forward,' \\" he said. \\"We cannot perform our duties without the confidence of the people that we are sworn to serve.\\"","output":"The given material discusses the idea of implementing a review system in law enforcement, similar to the one used by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for aviation incidents. This system would aim to learn from past incidents to prevent future ones, focusing on improvement rather than blame.

The need for such a system has been highlighted by several high-profile police-involved deaths, such as those of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. These incidents have led to a significant erosion of public trust in law enforcement. A review system, as proposed, could help restore this trust by demonstrating a commitment to learning from past mistakes and preventing future incidents.

Given material: With their striking flora and fauna and consistently pleasant temperatures, it’s no wonder that the Caribbean islands are often described as paradise. Across the region, ecosystems ranging from high-elevation cloud forests to cactus scrublands boast an incredible array of plants and animals. The Caribbean is also designated as a biodiversity hotspot, which means that its rich natural resources are under threat of destruction. About 70 percent of its original habitats have been lost to natural processes such as water and wind erosion, as well as human activities like deforestation, chemical dumping, and construction. Rising sea levels are another looming menace. One of the first recorded comparisons between the Caribbean and paradise came from Christopher Columbus in 1492 as he gazed upon the islands during his first voyage west. As we all know, Columbus sailed the ocean blue on behalf of the monarchs of Spain, both to find a faster trade route to Asia and to spread Catholicism. His name in Spanish, Cristóbal Colón, translates to “Christ-bearing colonizer,” and by all accounts he took this as a mandate. While justifying his actions with religion, Colón zealously commodified nature and human beings—including Indigenous people and Africans—to fund his colonial enterprise. Colón initiated the trans-Atlantic slave trade and supervised shipments of Indigenous peoples from the Caribbean to Europe. It was this ground-zero encounter, this tragic meeting of the so-called Old and New Worlds, that altered the course of global history. From Colón on, emerging European powers launched campaigns of genocide, forced religious conversion, and empire-building in the Caribbean—and subsequently throughout the Americas. These are the origins of the inequitable economic and social power relations that still exist in the region. The islands of the Caribbean were also where the term “Indian” was first applied to the Indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere. Among those Colón first encountered on his voyage were members of the Arawakan linguistic and cultural group, who called themselves Taíno, which translates to “good people.” At the time of contact, Taíno lived throughout the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas, and even in the southern area of what is today called Florida in the U.S. They traversed the Caribbean Sea by kanoa (canoes), the largest of which were said to hold up to 150 persons. Early European chroniclers noted that they spoke a lingua franca that was widely understood across the islands. Taíno communities were organized into chiefdoms focused on agriculture, fishing, hunting, gathering, and trade. The Taíno also enjoyed a rich spiritual and recreational life: Fray Ramón Pané, a 15th-century Spanish monk who accompanied Colón on his second voyage to the Americas, documented Taíno songs, origin stories, and the religious practice of carving elaborate figures to honor deities. Roberto Múkaro Borrero is president of the United Confederation of Taíno People, co-convener of the Indigenous Peoples Major Group on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and a programs and communications coordinator for the International Indian Treaty Council.","output":"Based on the given material, some of the activities that have led to the destruction of natural habitats in the Caribbean include deforestation, chemical dumping, and construction.

Given material: After hours of brainstorming and bickering, city and state leaders could not agree yesterday on a plan that would clear the way for the beleaguered Baltimore school system to receive millions of dollars in state assistance. State lawmakers began work on an arrangement that could place financial decisions in the hands of a trustee appointed by the governor, but Mayor Martin O'Malley called that proposal too extreme and pushed for a more moderate alternative. A group working on the problem is scheduled to meet today. O'Malley delivered four pages of recommendations to Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. yesterday, and said the fiscal crunch could be solved through a city-state \\"memorandum of understanding\\" that would establish new budget processes and a timeline for erasing a 58 million deficit. The city schools also require tens of millions of dollars to deal with a cash flow shortfall through June 30. The mayor proposed giving the school system a 33.6 million cash infusion by converting a multiyear agreement on employee benefits into a one-time payment. With the system poised to run out of money to pay its bills next month, the state has offered a major cash infusion in the form of a loan - but with major strings attached. \\"We fixed other departments in city government,\\" the mayor said. \\"We can fix this.\\" But legislative leaders were on a different tack, asking staffers to draft a bill modeled after school reforms in Oakland, Calif. - a system that faced deficit problems in recent years. \\"Trusteeship has worked in other places,\\" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller. Aides to the governor presented a third option at the meeting: a three-member fiscal control board. But there were no specifics behind the plan, and the governor's office could provide no details later. Political leaders debated several alternatives last night during a much-anticipated Statehouse \\"work group\\" led by state budget secretary James C. \\"Chip\\" DiPaula Jr. The session included O'Malley, Comptroller William Donald Schaefer and city lawmakers. Ehrlich left shortly after the meeting began, raising some eyebrows. \\"The governor and lieutenant governor left after three minutes, while we stayed around and did the real work,\\" said Del. Maggie L. McIntosh, a Baltimore Democrat. The major unresolved issue is how much control the city school board should relinquish in exchange for state aid. The governor says he wants strong accountability before providing loan money, but city officials think Ehrlich is looking for a way to impose pay cuts on city school employees. Former state Sen. Robert R. Neall, a volunteer financial adviser to the system before resigning in frustration, has recommended the pay reduction. \\"We want to find out if it's really about accountability or if it's about getting the teachers to take a pay cut,\\" said Stephen J. Kearney, an O'Malley spokesman. A bailout under consideration in Annapolis similar to one used in Oakland could lead to such pay reductions. Last June, the Oakland district - faced with growing deficits and shrinking enrollment - borrowed 65 million in state funds after it went into receivership under a 1991 law. As a condition of the loan, state officials appointed schools bailout specialist Randolph Ward as the administrator of the 45,000 student district, which has about half the enrollment of Baltimore. The Oakland school board stood powerless and parents were angered as Ward negotiated a 4 percent pay cut for 7,000 school employees, laid off about 100 custodians and announced the closing of five schools, said Oakland school board member Gary Yee. \\"The bottom line is that it's unrealistic to think that either Oakland or Baltimore can ever be other than educationally mediocre unless they get a lot more money,\\" Yee said. \\"The most they can get with a state administrator is fiscal accountability. But what school district would want packed classrooms, dirty hallways, and no elective classes in exchange for fiscal accountability?\\" O'Malley is trying to avoid such an outcome, and wants the city and state to spell out fiscal reforms through a memorandum agreement rather than create a state-level schools czar. Such a solution was used recently for a Prince George's County hospital, the mayor said. \\"There is a myth that's been surfacing in our state for quite a few years that if you're poor you're also incapable,\\" O'Malley said. O'Malley agreed with the state that a school reform plan the governor rejected early this week did not include \\"the requisite level of accountability to justify and safeguard the considerable financial investments\\" offered by the state, the city and the nonprofit Abell Foundation. In addition to offering 33.6 million through borrowing against a 15-year stream of payments that is owed to the school system, O'Malley has suggested an early retirement plan for the school system's nearly 1,000 teachers with 30 years of service. The mayor's letter suggests that any layoffs take place at the end of the school year to avoid disruptions to students. O'Malley said he did not support a pay cut because it would lead to a costly lawsuit with unions. In addition, the Abell Foundation would pull its pledged 8 million if teachers are forced to reduce their pay. Baltimore schools chief Bonnie S. Copeland received some good news yesterday when the state school board released 50 million in federal funds it had withheld last fall pending approval of a spending plan. The money was not a windfall: city and state officials had expected the system to comply with the federal No Child Left Behind Act. But Copeland was relieved. \\"This will help us address our enormous cash-flow problem,\\" Copeland said. About 38 million of the freed funds are earmarked for low-performing schools, she said, and the city has spent about 19 million on salaries and other expenses. Sun Staff writers Mike Bowler, Doug Donovan, Howard Libit, Tom Pelton and Ivan Penn contributed to this article. Maryland lawmakers work on a financial rescue plan that would be supervised by a trustee named by the governor. Mayor Martin O'Malley proposes a new budget process, a 33.6 million advance and early retirement for 1,000 teachers. The state board of education releases 50 million in federal money to the city schools that had been held up because the system had failed to comply with federal regulations.","output":"The major unresolved issues in the discussions between city and state leaders revolve around the question of financial accountability.

Given material: Imagine yourself at the doctor’s office bracing for your annual flu shot. Twenty minutes go by and during that period your fear escalates and you convince yourself the upcoming shot is going to hurt like hell. Does the expectation influence how it actually feels? I am a professor of psychology and neuroscience who, together with my colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, decided to explore how a child’s expectation of pain influences their actual experience, particularly anxious children. It is well-established that children are highly impressionable and are easily influenced by social media, their friends, and what they watch on television. The question of whether children, like adults, are influenced by expectations has not been studied in a systematic way. Our goal was to understand the effects of expectation on preparing children for upcoming painful procedures to inform treatment of pediatric pain in anxious patients. We suspected that if children expected pain, that’s how they would perceive it. We designed an experiment to test it. To prepare for our study, we applied heat to each child’s arm and asked them to rate levels of pain as low, medium or high. Then, during the experiment we focused on just the one temperature that each participant rated as medium. In our experiment we preceded the medium temperature test with two kinds of tones. One tone signaled to the child that gentle low heat was coming and the other that painful high heat was coming. When we asked children how painful the heat was, they rated the same temperature as more painful when it was preceded by a high tone. Of course it is important to be truthful and not discount a child’s worries all together. The point is not to deny that pain will occur, but rather to not hype it up and inadvertently impact children’s experience. Just as other studies have shown that expectations of pain relief can reduce pain levels in adults even when a placebo treatment is given, our study underscores that pain is a complex phenomenon and can be influenced by a number of psychological factors, including attention, emotion, and beliefs or expectations.","output":"The psychological factors that can influence pain perception, as described in the given material, include: 1. **Expectation**: The anticipation or expectation of pain can influence how an individual perceives the actual pain. For instance, if a child expects a procedure to be painful, they are likely to perceive it as such, even if the actual pain level is not as high as anticipated. 2. **Attention**: The level of focus or attention given to the pain can also affect its perception. If a person is highly focused on the pain or the potential for pain, they may perceive it as more intense. 3. **Emotion**: Emotional states, particularly anxiety, can influence pain perception. Anxious individuals may perceive pain more intensely than those who are calm. 4. **Beliefs**: What a person believes about pain can also influence their perception. For example, if a person believes that a certain procedure will be painful, they may perceive it as more painful than it actually is. 5. **Social and Media Influence**: Children, being highly impressionable, can be influenced by what they see on social media, hear from their friends, or watch on television. These influences can shape their expectations and beliefs about pain, thereby affecting their perception of it. In conclusion, pain perception is a complex phenomenon that can be influenced by a variety of psychological factors. Understanding these factors can help in preparing individuals, especially children, for potentially painful procedures and in managing their pain effectively."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What are the recommendations made by NSS Labs for structured vulnerability management programs? Given material: Research company NSS Labs says bug bounties should be mandatory for vendors. NSS Labs researchers Stefan Frei and Francisco Artes wrote in the International Vulnerability Purchase Program report that the cost of purchasing all of a vendor's vulnerabilities was miniscule compared to the vendor's revenue in the same time frame. Additionally, the researchers discovered that the cost of purchasing those vulnerabilities is nominal when comparing it to the expected losses incurred as a result of crime. Another benefit to the proposed program is that it will reduce the disclosure delay, Vikram Phatak, CEO of NSS Labs, told SCMagazine.com on Wednesday. He said it would reduce the return on investment for the attackers and will also create uncertainty in the market with regard to vulnerabilities that have already been exposed. With an increasing reliance on technology only leading to an increased number of security flaws, NSS Labs recommends a structured vulnerability management program that includes more competitive bug bounty programs, better incentives for the creation of more secure software and greater communications and disclosure between researchers. It is also recommended that software vendors invest in mechanisms for simple and automatic patching of their products.","output":"Based on the given material, NSS Labs makes several recommendations for structured vulnerability management programs: 1. Mandatory Bug Bounties: NSS Labs suggests that vendors should make bug bounty programs mandatory. These programs reward individuals who identify and report software bugs, particularly those involving security vulnerabilities. 2. Competitive Bug Bounty Programs: The bug bounty programs should be made more competitive to encourage more participation and discovery of vulnerabilities. 3. Incentives for Secure Software: NSS Labs recommends better incentives for the creation of more secure software. This could motivate developers to prioritize security in their software development process. 4. Improved Communication and Disclosure: There should be greater communication and disclosure between researchers. This can help in the timely identification and rectification of vulnerabilities. 5. Investment in Automatic Patching Mechanisms: Software vendors are advised to invest in mechanisms for simple and automatic patching of their products. This can help in quickly addressing identified vulnerabilities, thereby reducing potential security risks."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What did Jurgen Klopp say about the possibility of more activity at Liverpool before the transfer window closes? Given material: Jurgen Klopp has suggested Liverpool’s transfer activity may not be over ahead of this week’s deadline day. Liverpool, who reached the Champions League final last season, have enjoyed a productive summer, signing Naby Keita, Xherdan Shaqiri, Fabinho and Alisson. A number of young and fringe players have also departed Anfield, with the likes of Emre Can and Danny Ward leaving. The summer transfer window closes at 5pm on Thursday and, speaking after Liverpool’s 5-0 victory over Napoli in Dublin, Klopp hinted at more activity at the club. Asked about the possibility of any last-minute deals, Klopp said: ‘We will see what happens. ‘I cannot kill your D-day show, people sit there in front of the television all day waiting. ‘If any player from my team is available, then in every other situation in my life as a manager I would have bought all of them, to be honest.

Given material: The Hilton Garden Inn, owned by Kolter Hospitality, has remodeled its lobby and 180 rooms. A 5 million renovation is nearly complete at a Palm Beach Gardens hotel owned and operated by Kolter. Kolter is remodeling all 180 rooms and suites at the Hilton Garden Inn on Kyoto Gardens Drive, within walking distance of both Downtown at the Gardens and The Gardens Mall. All the rooms will be finished by Monday, General Manager Achim Kuhn said. Gone is the carpet, replaced with luxury vinyl tiles. Tubs are out, too, replaced by glass-paneled showers. Every room is a muted purple with a darker accent wall. The hotel ditched heavier, more traditional-looking furniture and replaced it with contemporary furniture and fixtures. All the windows and the tile roof got a thorough cleaning, too, said Jason DelGrosso, the hotel’s director of sales and marketing. “Just those small, little touches make a world of difference,” DelGrosso said. The hotel renovated during the summer to minimize the impact for guests and the hotel’s bottom line. Tearing out the bathtubs and carpet were the two big decisions, Kuhn said. Not to worry, the new flooring has a rubber backing that absorbs 98 percent of sound, said James W. Hansen, vice president of sales and marketing for Kolter Hospitality. Senior league baseball players and a few leisure travelers came and went from the hotel Thursday morning, but the bulk of guests are business travelers. One possible exception: spring training season, when “this place turns into a sea of red,” DelGrosso said. The hotel has about an 85 percent yearly occupancy rate, he said. With 5,000 combined square feet of meeting space, it also hosts business conferences — United Technologies was having a meeting there Thursday — and weddings for as many as 120 people. Another Palm Beach Gardens hotel, the Marriott on RCA Boulevard, was also in line for renovations, Rockbridge Capital announced after it bought the 279-room hotel for 29 million late last year. The planned updates included redoing the lobby, restaurant and bar area and guest rooms. Bill Black, Rockbridge’s director of marketing, referred questions to vice president Matt Welch, who did not respond to a phone message or email. It’s the tranquil setting that differentiates the Hilton Garden Inn from others along the PGA Boulevard corridor next to Interstate 95, DelGrosso said. There’s a gazebo overlooking Lake Victoria, which separates the hotel from Downtown at the Gardens. A walking path around the lake connects the hotel and the outdoor shopping complex. “It’s such a serene setting that you don’t normally get,” he said. An updated lobby was the first phase of the refresh. New patio furniture is also on its way. The owners continually updated the hotel over the past three years, Hansen said. “We’ll always have the freshest, newest version of the Hilton Garden Inn product,” he said.","output":"Based on the given material, the Hilton Garden Inn sets itself apart from other hotels in the PGA Boulevard and Interstate 95 area by its tranquil setting, which includes a gazebo overlooking Lake Victoria, a walking path around the lake connecting the hotel with the outdoor shopping complex, and being within walking distance of both Downtown at the Gardens and The Gardens Mall. However, the major differentiator for the Hilton Garden Inn is the recent renovation.

This renovation was completed with an aim to give guest's 'a world of difference'. The Hilton Garden Inn also caters to business travelers with its meeting space that could host business conferences or weddings for as many as 120 people.  One thing that is also a perk for guests is the sound absorbent rubber backing flooring, a feature that was introduced after the removal of carpets. Another perk is the hotel's high annual occupation rate of about 85%. The renovation was done during the summer to minimize the impact on guests and the hotel's revenue. This renovation is a part of the hotel's aim to continually provide its guests with the 'freshest, newest version of the Hilton Garden Inn product', as mentioned by James W. Hansen, vice president of sales and marketing for Kolter Hospitality. However, it must be noted that there are other hotels near this area that are also undergoing or have undergone renovations, such as the Marriott on RCA Boulevard."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What genre does Darkest Dungeon belong to, and what is the goal of the game? Given material: We know all about the big titles, with marketing material splashed all over our screens, magazines and billboards. But what about the hidden gems? The indie titles with smaller budgets but just as much heart (sometimes more). Have a look at the list to the best indie games of the year so far. The Witness comes from Braid developer Jonathan Blow (which means you know it’s going to be mind-bendingly challenging). It’s a first-person puzzle adventure game, in which you explore an unnamed island. You also uncover mazes which you must solve in order to continue and unlock subsequent puzzles, open doors, and so on. It’s a must play. Darkest Dungeon falls into the rogue genre. You have access to a fairly good roster of heroes, and as is typical of the genre, you select a handful when you embark on a mission. You’ll need to not only complete your missions, but manage the resources available to you. Every area has different challenges, all of which require specific strategies. You need to find the balance within your party to complete your task successfully. Gamespot refers to this game as The Breakfast Club meets Poltergeist. Yeah sounds about right. Five teenagers meddle with something they shouldn’t and accidentally unleash paranormal entities. There are a couple of different ways the narrative can play out, so this game deserves multiple playthroughs. If you have ever played any of Amanita Design’s games, you’ll be an instant convert. As always, it’s point and click, but the real strength of the studio’s games is the imagery and intertwined metaphors. I won’t lie, they’re also pretty weird and surreal, but absolutely gorgeous and memorable. Layers of Fear is unnervingly creepy. It tells the story of a painter trying to create the perfect portrait. The title not only refers to the literal layers of paint, but also the tragedy that unfolds as you explore the freaky family mansion. There are elements that aren’t 100% (the voice acting is one of them), but it’s a great scary story! Make sure you play it through more than once — there are three endings to uncover. If you played and loved Limbo, then you’ll love Inside, from developer Playdead. It’ both haunting and unsettling. It won’t leave you thinking it’s groundbreaking, but it will leave a lasting impression and while it might not be particularly replayable, you’ll be recommending it to all your friends. The format of this game is familiar to anyone who grew up playing what has now been termed the “Metroidvania” genre. You explore Earth in the future after climate change has submerged most of the world’s land mass. Oh, and did I mention you’re the last human alive? It’s a pretty short game, but it makes the most of the genre and executes it in the best fashion. Day of the Tentacle is one of my bestest, all time favourite games. The updated and remastered version of this game did absolutely not disappoint (and I was sceptical). Replay one of the best LucasArts games ever on your modern machine emulator free. It’s absolutely marvelous.","output":"Sure, I can help you with that! Darkest Dungeon belongs to the rogue genre, which means that it has procedurally generated content, randomized elements, and permanent death. The goal of the game is to manage a team of heroes and complete missions while navigating through dungeons. The game has a focus on resource management and strategic planning, as players must balance the strengths and weaknesses of their heroes to overcome challenges and defeat enemies. The game has a gothic horror theme and a dark atmosphere, with a focus on exploration, combat, and survival. Players must manage their team's stress levels, as well as their physical and mental health, in order to keep them alive and effective. The game also has a strong narrative focus, with a story that unfolds through quests and events. Overall, Darkest Dungeon is a challenging and immersive game that requires strategic thinking, resource management, and a willingness to take risks. It's a great choice for fans of rogue-like games, strategy games, and dark fantasy settings."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What has been revealed about how the ghosts of Christmas now do their work?

Given material: As my colleague, Adeel Omer, pointed out in his recent blog, digital transformation is not theory or projection, it’s something that is happening now. To varying degrees, digital transformation is taking place in every organization, of every size, in every industry, and across every sector. Whether we choose to embrace it or not is a different matter. The technology that drives transformation is changing at a phenomenal rate, with capabilities increasing by an order of magnitude (10x) every few years. This has a huge impact our every-day lives, as well as the expectations of anyone who uses or works with technology. The digital economy is, in essence, fundamentally changing the way IT must think about the applications and systems it oversees– the underlying infrastructure, and the people and processes required to support them. We must assume a digital transformation mindset as we develop the architectures, processes and skills required to support an interconnected, always on, instant access world. The rapidly accelerating scale and complexity of application ecosystems necessitates that organizations surrender direct, moment-by-moment systems control to software automation that enables us to reserve human interaction for monitoring and management. If we want our companies and organizations to remain relevant, and to meet or exceed the expectations of the digital economy, IT itself must transform to deliver the efficiency, predictability and agility needed to run these increasingly complex systems. The best, fastest way to do this is to change to a cloud model. Transformation of the underlying processes and personnel. These are not necessarily sequential phases, but rather distinct areas of development that must occur to create truly modern, future-ready IT. The critical tenets of a modern infrastructure are that it must be trusted, that it leverage flash storage for the best possible efficiency and performance, and that it is optimized to be scale-out, software-defined, and cloud-enabled. This combination of features integrates security and data protection with high performance infrastructure components that use a common ‘building block’ approach. Utilizing policy-driven application and data mobility, as well as the ability to fully leverage both on- and off-premises resources and delivering maximum flexibility for both programmability and the infrastructure itself, the modern infrastructure is powerful, efficient, agile, and optimized to support cloud. But modernization does not mean “rip and replace.” In fact, many organizations modernize different aspects of the IT infrastructure in phases to reduce disruption and budget pressures. And while it is possible to craft a modern infrastructure using disparate, and even existing server, storage or networking elements, the quickest, most efficient way to modernization is through the use of converged infrastructure, specifically hyper-converged infrastructures like VxRail, because these offerings are ready to deploy and are inclusive of all critical modernization aspects. The next element expands on the foundational architectural components, enhancing manageability by reliably removing the dependency on human interaction from routine day to day activities, instead leveraging software and policy-driven automation. This phase is focused on orchestration and enabling an Application Program Interface (API)-driven environment. APIs are critical, as they allow infrastructure to be programmed rather than relying on manual control, moving us away from scripts, command line interfaces (CLIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Once APIs are fully utilized, the possibility of human error is minimized and organizations can use orchestration tools to automate the delivery of infrastructure services. These processes are now easily repeatable, more predictable and more highly available. To this point, we’ve been discussing technology, but the final element of IT transformation is ultimately the most critical– the refinement of new processes and the skills of IT personnel. Your team will likely need to acquire new skills to support the new model. This will enhance productivity and allow them to develop, refine and manage more applications at greater scale. Modern IT manages through policy to automate routine activities (such as provisioning) into seamless processes that provide automated, self-service capabilities, removing the need for cumbersome activities like IT tickets and siloed manual steps. This delivers a frictionless consumption experience to application owners, and ultimately accelerates business agility. Business agility allows greater innovation, as well as the ability to iterate quickly, delivering better customer experiences and ensuring competitiveness. The true measure of the success of these modernization is in the end results. Dell EMC recently commissioned a study with analyst firm ESG, reaching out to thousands of IT executives and managers to gain greater insight into the results of these activities in real world environments. The resulting IT Transformation Maturity Study showed that organizations that have transformed IT operations are three times more likely to be ahead of schedule on new projects and are able to free up an additional 33 percent of budget for innovation as opposed to maintenance activities. These results demonstrate just how transformed organizations, specifically digitally transformed organizations, are able to be more future focused and far more efficient than organizations that continue to leverage legacy IT infrastructure, delivery models, and processes. While every organization is unique, there are clearly consistent parallels. Most are not able to transform every aspect of their IT operations all at once due to financial or resource constraints. However, those who have started the digital transformation journey are reaping the benefits. What matters most is that you begin now. Begin to plan. Begin to execute. Begin to transform. Robert Bradfield is a strategic campaign marketing director at Dell EMC.","output":"According to the article, the best way to modernize IT infrastructure is to embrace digital transformation and adopt a cloud model.

AHMEDABAD: Police have busted an extortion racket run by 'gau rakshaks', after a truck cleaner, Zaheer Qureshi (22) of Deesa, was stabbed at 12.30am on Sunday near Rajendra Park, Odhav, by so-called 'gau rakshaks'. It soon became clear to police that Qureshi had not been stabbed because he was transporting buffaloes, but because he did not pay protection money. Late on Monday evening, Ramol police arrested Neelraj Jain of Naroda, and are hunting for two more gang members - Mahendrasinh Jadeja and Lavjibhai. They regularly took protection money from truck driver Mustufa Sipahi, 40, of Vadhan village in Patan, to let trucks loaded with buffaloes pass through their area. DCP Himkar Singh said this is the first time such an extortion racket has been busted and arrests have been made. \\"While we have added section 307 to case for the stabbing of Qureshi. We have also lodged another complaint under the sections dealing with extortion. We will not spare anyone who indulges in such extortionate acts or violent deeds,\\" he added.

Bacon went on to publish her first book about the worst day of her life – the day she lost her son. To Bacon, Fresno State was the place she went when she needed a breath of inspiration. Bacon usually sits near the wall with her notebook on the ground. Some of her best works have come during those moments on campus, she said. Two years after writing her first book, she published her second with The Press at Fresno State, the university’s in-house press. Bacon is now working on her third book. The working title is “Daring to Breathe.” The book is about life after death for a parent who has lost a child and sharing the good, bad and ugly part of the journey. Bacon will also incorporate people’s survival stories she and her co-author collected through her time lecturing about her books.","output":"Based on the given material, the focus of Armen Bacon's third book, \\"Daring to Breathe,\\" is about life after death for a parent who has lost a child, sharing the good, bad, and ugly parts of the journey.

Given material: 'The Man From Earth' gets the Special Edition treatment. A strong story, lots of extras, but the remastered look isn't great. Ten years ago, The Man From Earth was released to the world. Not in theatres; the low-budget, indie film went straight to DVD. But with an excellent cast and cred for the writer, the movie went on to critical acclaim. It scored nominations, awards, and topped the list of Best Films in its genre. It was also, unfortunately, heavily pirated. Now, with an impending sequel, the original gets a remastered Special Edition release. The story is a great thought experiment. Professor John Oldman (David Lee Smith, CSI: Miami) is packing up to leave town unexpectedly. A group of his colleagues insist on having a going-away party. When he slips out, they follow him and demand an explanation for his attempted disappearance. John tells them he’s actually a 14,000-year-old caveman who moves along every ten years before people notice that he doesn’t age. Of course, no one believes him. But the more they try to poke holes in his story, while he can’t prove what he’s saying is true, they fail to disprove it, either. The Man From Earth plays very much like a play. Almost all the action is on one set, taking place in a single day. The ensemble by and large all stay on camera for the duration, making it a dialogue-heavy conversation piece. There isn’t any action, per se, just an intense examination of the claim and the ramifications of such a thing, exploring both the practical and the historical. Given that the characters are college professors, the conversation is high-brow and intelligent, covering a wide variety of angles. The ensemble cast also has plenty of Star Trek cred in it. Among them are John Billingsley (a lead in Star Trek: Enterprise), Tony Todd (guest star in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and Star Trek: Voyager), and Richard Riehle (guest star in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager, and Star Trek: Enterprise). Rounding out the cast are Ellen Crawford (ER), Annika Peterson (Tanner Hall), Alexis Thorpe (Days of Our Lives), and William Katt (Carrie). While not a highly recognizable troupe, these are all working actors who do a good job. The Man From Earth holds up very well as a story. The plot is engrossing, the actors are natural, and there are enough surprises to make it worth it to pay attention. While it doesn’t answer every question that could be posed, it covers a lot of ground, and Bixby did a great job trying to anticipate what viewers would ask. I’m glad it’s getting a re-release to bring more attention to it. But despite the expense spent on upgrading the film to HD (which it was not filmed in), I’m not sure the job was good enough to justify it. Sure, the original quality is soft and a bit blurry, but the new version is harsh and grainy. Watching the side-by-side comparison in the Blu-ray special features, I personally appreciated the original better. I’m not saying The Man From Earth couldn’t be made to look higher-quality, but I don’t think this release does it. There are a wealth of bonus features on the Blu-ray. We get trailers for both the original movie and the upcoming sequel. There are two audio commentaries to choose from. There’s a very entertaining, very short film called “Contagion.” A few featurettes are interesting. I am loathe to complain about a behind-the-scenes feature, as most are too short for my taste, but the one here is actually too long. Perhaps it would be better split into chunks, as it runs roughly the same length as the film. But I’m not sure that would help much, as there are a lot of unnecessary conversation in it. It’s cool to hear most of the cast, Bixby’s son, a producer, and director Richard Schenkman talk about the unique filming process and the piracy issues. However, there’s repetition and tangents that make it drag on. So for once, I have to say this one could use some editing down. This is a great film, and I’m very glad to get to see it. It feels indie and low-budget, but that might be a plus for this particular story. The extras, despite my minor complaint that the main one could use some editing down, are plenty and mostly enjoyable. I recommend Jerome Bixby’s The Man From Earth, available now.","output":"The Blu-ray release of 'The Man From Earth' includes a variety of bonus features.

Given material: With suicide bombings spreading from Iraq to Afghanistan, the Pentagon has tasked intelligence analysts to pinpoint what’s driving Muslim after Muslim to do the unthinkable. Their preliminary finding is politically explosive: it’s their “holy book” the Quran after all, according to intelligence briefings obtained by WND. In public, the U.S. government has made an effort to avoid linking the terrorist threat to Islam and the Quran while dismissing suicide terrorists as crazed heretics who pervert Islamic teachings. “The terrorists distort the idea of jihad into a call for violence and murder,” the White House maintains in its recently released “National Strategy for Combating Terrorism” report. But internal Pentagon briefings show intelligence analysts have reached a wholly different conclusion after studying Islamic scripture and the backgrounds of suicide terrorists. They’ve found that most Muslim suicide bombers are in fact students of the Quran who are motivated by its violent commands – making them, as strange as it sounds to the West, “rational actors” on the Islamic stage. In Islam, it is not how one lives one’s life that guarantees spiritual salvation, but how one dies, according to the briefings. There are great advantages to becoming a martyr. Dying while fighting the infidels in the cause of Allah reserves a special place and honor in Paradise. And it earns special favor with Allah. “His actions provide a win-win scenario for himself, his family, his faith and his God,” the document explains. “The bomber secures salvation and the pleasures of Paradise. He earns a degree of financial security and a place for his family in Paradise. He defends his faith and takes his place in a long line of martyrs to be memorialized as a valorous fighter. The briefing – produced by a little-known Pentagon intelligence unit called the Counterintelligence Field Activity, or CIFA – cites a number of passages from the Quran dealing with jihad, or “holy” warfare, martyrdom and Paradise, where “beautiful mansions” and “maidens” await martyr heroes. In preparation for attacks, suicide terrorists typically recite passages from six surahs, or chapters, of the Quran: Baqura (Surah 2), Al Imran (3), Anfal (8), Tawba (9), Rahman (55) and Asr (103). CIFA staffs hundreds of investigators and analysts to help coordinate Pentagon security efforts at U.S. military installations at home and abroad. The Pentagon unit is especially concerned about a new wave of suicide bombings hitting Afghanistan. Suicide bombings have killed more than 200 people in Afghanistan this year, up from single digits two years ago. On Tuesday, a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest and killed 18 outside an Afghan government compound. Last week, a suicide bomber riding a bike killed at least four NATO soldiers. And earlier this month, a suicide car bomber rammed into a U.S. military convoy near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, killing 16 people, including two American soldiers. The U.S. command in Afghanistan now warns that a suicide bombing cell is operating inside the Afghan capital. Meanwhile, the Taliban’s top military commander told ABC News he has 500 suicide bombers at his disposal. The emergence of a suicide cell in Kabul troubles military analysts because suicide attacks are the most effective weapon Muslim terrorists can use against the West. The Rand Corp. predicts they’ll pose a serious and constant threat to the U.S. for years to come. The U.S. intelligence community is growing increasingly worried, as well. Many scholars and media pundits, however, insist Muslim suicide bombers are not driven by religion. He says U.S. foreign policy is more a factor than faith. “Though it speaks of Americans as infidels, al-Qaida is less concerned with converting us to Islam than removing us from Arab and Muslim lands,” Pape said. But what about the recent video by Adam Gadahn, the American al-Qaida, warning fellow Americans to convert to Islam before al-Qaida attacks again? “He never mentions virgins or the benefits Islamic martyrs receive in Heaven,” Pape asserted. In fact, Gadahn notes 36 minutes into his speech that Allah reserves the highest rewards – “honors and delights” – for martyrs in Paradise. The 9/11 hijackers and the London bombers made martyrdom videos. In their last testaments, they recite the Quran while talking of their “love of death” and “sacrificing life for Allah.” Seven martyrdom videotapes also were recovered by British authorities in the foiled transatlantic sky terror plot. But are the virgins scriptural or apocryphal? French documentarian Pierre Rehov, who interviewed the families of suicide bombers and would-be bombers in an attempt to find out why they do it, says it’s not a myth or fantasy of heretics. He says there’s no doubt the Quran “promises virgins” to Muslim men who die while fighting infidels in jihad, and it’s a key motivating factor behind suicide terrorism. Muslim clerics do not disavow the virgins-for-martyrs reward as a perverted interpretation of the Quran. And the founder of an allegedly mainstream Muslim group in Washington – the Council on American-Islamic Relations – also has given his blessing to suicide bombings. Addressing a youth session at the 1999 Islamic Association for Palestine’s annual convention in Chicago, CAIR founder Omar Ahmad praised suicide bombers who “kill themselves for Islam,” according to a transcript provided by terror expert Steve Emerson’s Investigative Project. Osama bin Laden has encouraged “Muslims brothers” to defeat the U.S. and U.K. with suicide attacks.","output":"According to the CIFA briefing cited in the article, suicide terrorists typically recite passages from the following six surahs, or chapters, of the Quran in preparation for attacks: 1. Surah 2 (Baqura) 2. Surah 3 (Al Imran) 3. Surah 8 (Anfal) 4. Surah 9 (Tawba) 5. Surah 55 (Rahman) 6. Surah 103 (Asr) These passages deal with themes such as jihad, martyrdom, Paradise, and the rewards awaiting martyrs in the afterlife. By studying these passages and the backgrounds of suicide terrorists, intelligence analysts have reached the conclusion that these individuals are often driven by the teachings of the Quran and the promise of spiritual benefits in the afterlife."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What precautionary measures should be taken by travelers passing through Siberia to deal with the threat posed by the methane bubbles? Given material: July 7, 2017, 1:04 p.m. Siberia's frozen landscape, locked in time for thousands of years, may be coming back to life in violent fashion. Scientists using both satellite imagery and ground-based surveys have discovered more than 7,000 bulging bubbles of gas on Siberia's Yamal and Gydan peninsulas. These potentially dangerous protrusions contain mostly methane and create a surreal ripple effect on the ground when stepped on. A video taken last summer on Siberia's Bely Island showed first-hand the bizarre nature of this phenomenon. Because methane is extremely flammable, there is increasing concern that these bulges will begin to explode. One such explosion happened at the end of June on the Yamal Peninsula. Witnesses to the explosion reported fire shooting up in the sky and chunks of permafrost popping up out of the ground. The result was a 164-foot-deep crater on a river near a reindeer encampment (the reindeer are all fled the area, according to The Siberian Times, and a newborn calf was saved by a reindeer herder). Scientists discovered another crater in June, following reports from locals that an explosion happened sometime between January and April. Aleksandr Sokolov, deputy head of the ecological research and development station of the Institute of Ecology of Plants and Animals, in Labytnangi, told The Siberian Times, \\"This plot of land was absolutely flat just two years ago,\\" but that by 2016, \\"it bulged and we could see that soil has [sic] cracked there.\\" The vast region is already pockmarked with craters from similar explosions, including a 260-foot-wide hole discovered in 2014. Such hidden dangers in particular pose a threat to both transport infrastructure and Siberia's energy sector. As the emergence of these bulges in a new phenomenon, scientists say they're likely caused by the region's first thaw in more than 11,000 years. “Their appearance at such high latitudes is most likely linked to thawing permafrost, which in is in turn linked to overall rise of temperature on the north of Eurasia during last several decades,” a spokesperson for the Russian Academy of Science told The Siberian Times in March. Besides the potential for rapidly forming sinkholes and explosions, these bulges also represent a significant addition to greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The release of methane from Siberian permafrost, a gas more than 25 times more potent than carbon in trapping heat in the atmosphere, rose from 3.8 million tons in 2006 to more than 17 million tons in 2013. The researchers say they will continue to map the gas bubble formations throughout 2017 to determine which pose the most serious danger. With no end in sight, however, for the region's warming trend, it's clear that anyone traveling through Siberia will have to contend with this growing threat for the foreseeable future. Scientists estimate more than 7,000 dangerous methane 'bumps' have formed in Siberia's Yamal and Gydan peninsulas over the last couple of years.","output":"Travelers passing through Siberia should take the following precautionary measures to deal with the threat posed by the methane bubbles: 1. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest news and research about the methane bubble formations. Scientists are continuously mapping these formations to determine which pose the most serious danger. 2. Avoid Known Areas: Avoid areas known to have these methane bubbles, especially the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas where more than 7,000 dangerous methane 'bumps' have been identified. 3. Be Alert: Be vigilant about the ground conditions. The bubbles create a surreal ripple effect on the ground when stepped on. If you notice such a phenomenon, move away from the area immediately. 4. Report Incidents: If you witness any methane bubble explosion or a new formation, report it to local authorities and scientists working on this issue. Your information could be crucial in mapping these dangerous formations. 5. Plan Your Route: Plan your travel route carefully, taking into account the locations of known methane bubble formations.  6. Emergency Plan: Have an emergency plan in place in case of an unexpected encounter with a methane bubble. This could include evacuation procedures and emergency contact numbers. 7. Travel in Groups: If possible, travel in groups. This can provide additional safety in case of an emergency. Remember, these methane bubbles are extremely flammable and can explode, causing sinkholes and other dangerous situations. It's important to take these precautions seriously when traveling through Siberia."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What recommendations were made by the study's researchers for advancing shared living between Jews and Arabs in Israel? Given material: ‘Study shows there is still not enough maturity and understanding among the Jewish public for practical steps for living together,’ says Givat Haviva. While the vast majority of Israeli Jews and Arabs support coexistence, only a fraction of Jews are willing to have Arabs as neighbors, painting a bleak portrait for practical steps forward, according to a recent study by The Center for a Shared Society at Givat Haviva. According to the study, 84.3% of Arabs and 63.7% of Jews support the idea of ​​coexistence. However, only 13% of Jewish Israelis said they would like to live next door to Arab neighbors. Among its other findings: more than half of Jewish respondents visited an Arab neighborhood over the past year, while 56.4% of them want their children to learn Arabic from an early age. The figures for Arabs are much greater: over 90% said that they visited Jewish communities over the past year, while 84.2% are interested in teaching their children Hebrew from an early age. The survey also found that the majority of both sectors agree that the key to advancing coexistence is education, with 71.1% of the respondents stating that it was important for them that educational training be given to teachers on the topic of shared life. About half (51.1%) said they believe that the establishment of an intellectual and academic forum between the groups will promote constructive dialogue and growth. There were significant differences in respondents’ answers to the question of how important it is for them to increase the proportion of Arabs in government and public systems in Israel, with 63% of Arabs agreeing compared to only 10% of Jews. similarly, only 34.9% of Jews but 72.4% of Arabs said they would support a Jewish-Arab political party that would advance the concept of shared life, with 55% of Arabs stating that such a party would improve their willingness to vote in elections. “These figures show a clear picture that there is great openness – and even expectation – among Arab and Jewish society for the establishment of a joint party that will work to consolidate coexistence in Israel,” Sagi said. Still, the study found that 70% of Jews do not support the allocation of state land for the purpose of increasing Arab communities. The study’s full findings and recommendations will be presented Tuesday at the Knesset Advocacy Group for the Advancement of Shared Living between Jews and Arabs. Founded in 1949 by the Kibbutz Federation, the Center for a Shared Society at Givat Haviva was created “to build an inclusive, socially cohesive society in Israel by engaging divided communities,” according to its website. Last week, its researchers interviewed 505 Israelis – 429 (79%) who are Jewish, and 76 (21%) who are Arab – representing the per-capita demographic makeup of each group in the country.","output":"Based on the given material, the study's researchers at the Center for a Shared Society at Givat Haviva made the following recommendations for advancing shared living between Jews and Arabs in Israel: 1. Education: The researchers emphasized the importance of education in promoting coexistence, suggesting that teachers should receive training on the topic of shared life. They also recommended establishing an intellectual and academic forum between the two groups to foster constructive dialogue and growth. 2. Increasing Arab representation in government and public systems: The study suggests that increasing the proportion of Arabs in government and public systems could help foster better understanding between the two communities. 3. Establishment of a joint political party: The researchers found that there is a strong expectation among Arab and Jewish society for the establishment of a joint party that will work to consolidate coexistence in Israel. Such a party could potentially improve Arab willingness to vote in elections. 4. Addressing the social and economic disparities between Jewish and Arab communities: The study found that there is still not enough maturity and understanding among the Jewish public for practical steps for living together. Addressing social and economic disparities between the communities could help bridge this gap and foster mutual understanding. 5. Encouraging inter-community visits: The researchers suggested that encouraging more inter-community visits and interactions could help improve relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel. It is important to note that advancing shared living between Jews and Arabs in Israel is a complex issue, and the recommendations provided by the study's researchers should be considered as part of a broader framework of social, economic, and political reforms."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What steps are employers taking to hold onto workers in the current job market, and what factors are contributing to the expectation of business improvement?

In other words, blame it on someone else. Fans were quick to respond when Lolo Jones played the “not my fault” blame game. And she flung criticism at them in return. In order to have the opportunity to learn the dances in detail, Lolo Jones even halted her track season. And because this was professional dancer Keo Motsepe’s first season, everyone felt rotten that he had to step off the glittering ballroom floor. However, Lolo Jones focused on her own frustration. She even spent time texting her partner about her slippery slope to the bottom rather than watch the other dancers perform, reported the Times-Picayune on September 17. So what would make a track superstar want to slip, slide, and slump on the dance floor? Lolo Jones revealed that, like so many adults who are successful later in life, she suffered in her teens. A bad experience at a high school dance made her give the cold shoulder to dancing with a partner until Dancing with the Stars. “This is my chance to make up for that,” Lolo Jones explained. “My prayer tonight is for God to soften me and my heart. When you go so many times rejected in public you put walls up. When I was dancing last night and messed up I had flashbacks of the three Olympics and that people constantly tease me about. I thought oh no here it comes again. People are going to ridicule me. I’m so tired of feeling embarrassed. As The Inquisitr reported, Lolo Jones is the only star with an athletic background. Because so many viewers assumed that she would do well, this leaves the season open for other celebrities to sparkle brighter than the mirror ball trophy. What do you think? Who did you vote for?","output":"Based on the given material, Lolo Jones' attitude towards her partner and other contestants on the show seems to be somewhat self-focused and defensive. She experienced frustration and disappointment due to her early elimination and the challenges she faced during her performances. This led her to focus more on her own struggles, as evidenced by her decision to text her partner about her difficulties rather than watch the other dancers perform. She also appeared to have a defensive attitude towards the fans and critics, responding to criticism with criticism of her own. However, it's important to note that she was dealing with personal issues and past traumas, which she revealed had affected her performance and attitude. She expressed a desire to overcome these issues and improve, indicating a level of self-awareness and determination. As for her attitude towards her partner, Keo Motsepe, the material doesn't provide a lot of direct information. However, it does mention that she spent time texting him about her struggles, which could suggest a level of trust and openness. It's unclear, though, how this communication was received or how it affected their partnership."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What was the reason for not having fireworks in this year's Hollydazzle? Given material: Hollydazzle — the annual celebration that draws tens of thousands of people to City Center in Newport News — will look a little different this year and might be extended over multiple weekends. Rather than the fireworks that usually cap off the event along with lighting a Christmas tree, Hollydazzle will feature a choreographed light show, according to city spokeswoman Kim Lee. Usually, Hollydazzle takes place one evening in December, bringing in performers, vendors and activities around the fountain and surrounding streets at City Center. Lee said details of this year’s Hollydazzle are still in the works, but it will likely occur over multiple weekends in December. Over those weekends, Lee said the event will also likely include new elements and activities, along with multiple presentations of the light show. According to Daily Press archives, about 30,000 people attended Hollydazzle in 2016. The layout of Hollydazzle will also be different this year because of the construction of the new Ferguson building in the green space around the City Center fountain. Hollydazzle has become more popular in recent years, Lee said. The higher attendance and less space because of the upcoming Ferguson building gave the city a “good opportunity to take a look at Hollydazzle and revamp and expand it with offerings throughout the season allowing for more folks to experience it,” Lee said. “It’s kind of sad” not to have the fireworks, said Liz Parker, president of the Newport News Hospitality Association. The association promotes and markets Newport News to visitors and tries to help make their visits memorable. Expanding the event over multiple weekends would be good for the businesses in the association, Parker said. Parker said she was told that the fireworks were changed partially because of safety concerns with the new building going up. She pointed out other events in Newport News with fireworks but said that aspect of Hollydazzle would be missed. She was interested to see how the new offerings and expanded event would play out. Changes in the cost to put on Hollydazzle have not been determined because the city is still in a planning phase.","output":"The reason for not having fireworks in this year's Hollydazzle is due to safety concerns prompted by the construction of the new Ferguson building in the green space around the City Center fountain. While the city plans to revamp and expand Hollydazzle with new elements and activities spread across multiple weekends in December, the traditional fireworks show has been replaced with a choreographed light show. The safety concerns associated with the ongoing construction around the City Center fountain helped guide this decision. The event has grown more popular in recent years, and expanding it over several weekends is anticipated to draw in more attendees and provide a boost to local businesses. Despite this change, the absence of the fireworks show has been noted as a disappointment by some, including Liz Parker, president of the Newport News Hospitality Association."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: What were the consequences of Trump's comments about Putin?

Russia’s Vladimir Putin is an opportunist who has shown a willingness to invade neighboring countries and, perhaps, to meddle in American politics. Trump’s comments on Wednesday prompted rebukes from Democrats, including Panetta and Hutson, and forced fellow Republicans, including his running mate Mike Pence, to do damage control. On Thursday, Pence claimed Trump was being sarcastic, though the joke was lost on the public. This nation has 150,000 troops stationed overseas, in harm’s way. NATO troops must be on the ready in the Baltics and other former Soviet bloc nations. They cannot be pleased that the man who would be their commander in chief is making light of Putin, who has destabilized Ukraine, annexed Crimea and regularly threatens small countries that, until Ronald Reagan’s presidency, were part of Russia’s orbit. We’re not pleased either. It’s time for all sides to stop heckling national security.","output":"The consequences of Trump's comments about Putin were significant. His remarks prompted rebukes from Democrats and forced fellow Republicans, including his running mate Mike Pence, to do damage control.

The comments raised concerns about the nation's security, particularly given the threats posed by countries like North Korea, China, and Russia. The fact that Trump appeared to make light of Putin's actions, such as invading neighboring countries and meddling in American politics, was alarming to many. This caused unease among NATO troops stationed in the Baltics and other former Soviet bloc nations, as well as the 150,000 US troops stationed overseas.

Given material: So you think you can act (or write or direct)? For the first time, THR surveys the experts and finds out where to get a postgraduate education — maybe even one that could land you a job. This year, THR is lifting its annual ranking of the best drama schools to a higher level. The magazine is concentrating on the best places to get a postgraduate education (with one- to three-year programs) and for the first time is expanding the polling process to include not just casting directors but members of the SAG Foundation and the schools themselves (asking them to rank their competition) as well as other experts. The results are appropriately dramatic, with surprising additions to the list — including one top school located in a former Buick dealership and another on a buffalo ranch. Two words: Meryl and Streep. And if they weren't enough: Angela Bassett, Sigourney Weaver, Frances McDormand, Patricia Clarkson, Paul Giamatti … But the star power of its graduates isn't the only thing that makes Yale a top pick. No other school offers as many production opportunities. Yale Rep has premiered more than 100 plays, including two Pulitzer Prize winners and four finalists, and sent 12 shows to Broadway that earned more than 40 Tony noms (and eight wins). More recent grads (with good jobs) include: Empire's Trai Byers, Agents of SHIELD's Brett Dalton, How to Get Away With Murder's Aja Naomi King and new film star Marissa Neitling, who appears opposite Dwayne Johnson (who didn't go to Yale) in San Andreas. Its acting program works hand in glove with its writing program, which churns out plenty of heavyweights of its own (including Pulitzer winner David Auburn). Last year, the ink was barely dry on Alex Sharp's diploma when he landed the lead in the Broadway production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Other famous grads — or in Kevin Spacey and Kelsey Grammer's cases, near-grads (they left after two years) — include Viola Davis, Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. This program \\"produces fearless actors\\" (according to chair Mark Wing-Davey) using an avant-garde curriculum mixing classical dramatic training with more esoteric studies — like, um, neuroscience. \\"We ask how we can avail ourselves of new tools and understandings,\\" explains Davey. Grads include Michael C. Hall, Peter Krause and Marcia Gay Harden. The oldest drama school in America is better known for its undergraduates — churning out winners like Ted Danson, James Cromwell, Rob Marshall, Steven Bochco, Ming-Na Wen, Holly Hunter, Zachary Quinto and Matt Bomer (who picked up a Golden Globe this year for his turn in HBO's The Normal Heart). But its graduate program is gaining traction. A partnership with the Tony-winning La Jolla Playhouse means that everybody who gets in ends up with a job: MFA students are assured at least one professional residency at the theater. Only 2 percent of applicants are accepted into this demanding two-year program — that's just seven new students per year. The Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons got his MFA there in 2001; now he's got four Emmys, a Golden Globe and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Here's where Carrie Fisher learned how to speak like Princess Leia (with a \\"British accent that ebbs and flows like menstrual bloat\\" was how she once described it). Other grads who went on to make something of themselves include Laurence Olivier, Julie Christie, Kathleen Turner, Vanessa Redgrave and — more recently — Game of Thrones' Kit Harington, The Amazing Spider-Man's Andrew Garfield and The Hobbit's Martin Freeman. \\"Central stands at the heart of training and research for our great British theater,\\" says yet another grand alum, Judi Dench. A partnership with the Tony-winning Trinity Rep (home to nearly 60 world premieres) is a huge plus for this Ivy League postgraduate program. Undergrad alums who've made their way to Hollywood include The Office's John Krasinski and Modern Family's Julie Bowen. But the graduate program has produced such theater luminaries as Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Quiara Alegria Hudes. Ed Harris, who graduated from CalArts in 1975. Partnerships with a renowned regional theater (the George Street Playhouse) and a much-farther-flung venue (Shakespeare's Globe in London) make this program a unique experience. MFA recipient Moritz von Stuelpnagel — class of 2014 — is a Tony frontrunner for best direction of a play for the hit Hand to God. Calista Flockhart at Rutgers in pre-'Ally McBeal' days. The school's film, theater and television programs are all under one roof — and often collaborate — which makes this campus, smack in the middle of the entertainment capital of the world, a smart choice for learning about showbiz. Grads: Richard Lewis, Eric Roth, Corbin Bernsen and Francis Ford Coppola. Located on a former buffalo ranch, this small, long-established program accepts only eight actors a year — four men, four women. Empire's Grace Gealey was among the lucky few; she got her MFA in acting here in 2010. 'Empire’s' Grace Gealey, who got her MFA from UC Irvine in 2010. USC is better known for its film school (see THR's 2015 Top 25 Film Schools list, coming in July) than its drama program. But plenty of success stories have had their start here, including Jay Roach, Shonda Rhimes and Stephen Sommers. And a new partnership with the Shanghai Theatre Academy in China has opened doors, as the Summer Institute for International Actors organizes student exchanges across the Pacific. The American Repertory Theater — a huge deal on the national theater scene, with 17 Tonys (including one a year since 2012), 12 Drama Desk Awards, a Pulitzer and a Grammy — allows 23 students a year into its two-year program in Cambridge. Then it ships a bunch of them to Russia for several months of training at the Moscow Art Theatre School. Steve Zahn (right) in the American Repertory Theater production of The Miser in 1989. The 8-to-1 student-teacher ratio at this campus outside Los Angeles — founded in 1970 by no less an entertainment educator than Walt Disney — makes it easy to find a mentor. Graduates include Ed Harris, Don Cheadle and Alison Brie. Don Cheadle, class of ’86, during his school days at CalArts. The Old Vic is aptly named: The 250-year-old stage is the U.K.'s most ancient continuously working theater. But it's still pretty spry, sending a risky hit like Jane Eyre to the National Theatre last year. The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School — founded by Laurence Olivier in 1946 — is mainly an undergraduate program but accepts up to 14 MA students a year. Daniel Day-Lewis, Jeremy Irons, Miranda Richardson, Patrick Stewart, Mark Strong, Olivia Williams and Lydia Leonard (who just got a Tony nomination for Wolf Hall Parts One & Two) got their starts here. Springboarding off the success of its long-admired undergraduate program — which trained Mel Gibson, Baz Luhrmann, Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis and virtually every other Australian actor or director you've ever heard of — NIDA launched MFA programs for writing and directing in 2014. Its first group of graduate students recently finished the 15-month course in May. The 6-to-1 student-teacher ratio makes this small program one of the more intimate acting-school experiences. But it attracts plenty of jumbo-sized speakers. Master classes have been taught by F. Murray Abraham and Faye Dunaway, and there have been lectures by David Mamet, Julie Harris, Jonathan Pryce, John Malkovich and Gary Sinise. Recent alums include Stana Katic (Castle) and W. Earl Brown (Deadwood). Method acting was invented here; it's where Brando, Pacino and De Niro all learned to mumble. Students of the only MFA program sanctioned by the Actors Studio carry on the Stanislavski tradition, which makes this school, in the words of alum Bradley Cooper, \\"a sacred place.\\" \\"A brain trust for the American theater\\" is how the school's chair, Christian Parker, describes his program. And with guest lecturers like Cate Blanchett, Edward Albee, Alec Baldwin and Stephen Sondheim, he's not entirely wrong. BU's College of Fine Arts is housed in a Beaux Arts building festooned with gargoyles shaped like mechanics — it used to be a Buick dealership. But never mind. Inside is the MFA program in playwriting founded by Nobel laureate Derek Walcott that accepts only four or five candidates every year. The directing MFA accepts only one or two. But there are no acting MFAs; instead, BU's undergrad acting students get a postgraduate internship in L.A. (with the likes of CBS Entertainment chairman Nina Tassler or Seinfeld's Jason Alexander). \\"Circle,\\" as it's known to students, is the only accredited training conservatory associated with a Broadway theater. If there's a school style, look for it in alums Felicity Huffman, Kevin Bacon, Idina Menzel, Benicio Del Toro and Lady Gaga. \\"Two things I learned while at Circle: that theater matters and that acting is an art form as great as any other,\\" alum Philip Seymour Hoffman once said of the school. Many schools ruthlessly prune their students, culling the ranks from semester to semester. It's Survivor, with every performer fending for himself. At Delaware, though, the class is taught to be a troupe, a unit. That philosophy — developed by artistic director Sanford Robbins — seems to get results. Over the past 16 years, 94 percent of students seeking summer acting employment have managed to get it. Esper worked for 17 years with Sanford Meisner — the guy who trained James Caan and Robert Duvall — and taught the repetition-based technique to Jeff Goldblum, Amy Schumer and Sam Rockwell. Grad Timothy Olyphant calls the school \\"inspiring and invaluable.\\" Graduates (like Rainn Wilson, Joel McHale and Jean Smart) tend to get work; about 50 percent of students land gigs within 12 months of graduating. It took alum Kyle MacLachlan much less time, though. His phone started ringing the minute he picked up his diploma. One of the callers was Dino De Laurentiis, offering MacLachlan a star-making role in Dune. MacLachlan initially thought it was a crank call.","output":"Here are some AI generated responses based on the given material with minimal editing: \`\`\` Question/Instruction: Who are some graduates of the small and exclusive MFA program at the California Institute of the Arts?

Given material: Is the spotlight fading on Ed Miliband’s leadership? Labour appears to have sleepwalked into a leadership crisis. But how likely are claims of a new leader to replace him before the 2015 general election? And who might replace him? Is Ed Miliband on borrowed time? Can he survive the weekend? Until Christmas? Until next year’s election? In the last 72 hours Labour has been plunged into panic with talk of poisonous briefings and even claims that a letter is circulating calling for Mr Miliband to stand aside. But why now? What exactly is troubling the party that was not doing so six months ago? And is there anything in any of this beyond feverish speculation? Well, yes and no. First, the speculation. As of yet no such “letter” has been seen. No MP has come out on the record in favour of ousting their leader. Nor are any of the recent criticisms of his leadership particularly new. Mr Miliband has long suffered an image problem. There have been flashes of policy inspiration, but he has struggled to broaden his appeal beyond core Labour voters. Some say the cost-of-living-crisis is not permeating with quite the policy punch he would hope. What has changed for Mr Miliband recently is the acuteness of his problems. Consider the above against the more pressing backdrop of a collapse in his personal poll ratings, the rise of the SNP threatening to scorch 20 of Labour’s 41 Scottish seats (crucial for a 2015 victory). Add the Greens garnering greater support – not to mention Ukip broadening its appeal among the working class. Suddenly the picture changes. Problems that were once platitudes now have a crushing urgency to be resolved. Indeed, by this analysis Labour is not just drifting. It is failing to pre-empt contemporary political threats – and, thanks to new, credible alternatives, heading to the humiliation of defeat where victory once seemed likely. That is a particularly rude awakening for MPs, many of whom feel the downward trajectory is difficult to curtail at this late stage. Add that to the New Statesman magazine appearing to withdraw its once-default support for Mr Miliband, and it soon becomes clear why the mood inside Labour HQ has plummeted. But could this really result in a change of leader before the election? The prospect is not impossible but it is still difficult to imagine. Firstly, Labour’s historical record in ousting a leader is nothing short of abysmal. Party rules mean that a vote of no-confidence can only be marshalled during the party’s annual conference – which was six weeks ago. For the moment, curmudgeonly backbenchers seem happier complaining off-the-record about their leader than putting their head above the parapet and pitching an alternative. And that’s hardly surprising. Labour’s MP’s are not known to be forward about coming forward. One only need remember 2009 during Gordon Brown’s premiership which saw former pensions secretary James Purnell’s dramatic resignation, in which he called for the then prime minister to stand aside “to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election”. It was followed in 2010 by simultaneous resignations by Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon. But neither of these were enough to move Mr Brown, who went on to lose the election himself five months later. Mr Miliband appears just as resilient. The prospect of him grabbing his coat and exiting stage left is unlikely. Three MPs are understood to have told Dave Watts, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party that Mr Miliband should stand down. But it will need far more than that – as well as a clear contingency plan – for any chance of a leadership shift. Finally, the perennial question that hampers any immediate prospect of change. Who exactly would replace him? Who could actually do a better job? And who could stave off the prospect of a party implosion that would almost inevitably follow? With no clear contender to challenge Mr Miliband, talk of a change of leader remains just that. Here are five potential successors. The shadow health secretary is currently the leading candidate. His performances at the last Labour conference were impressive, where Mr Miliband’s were not. His dogged campaigning on the Hillsborough tragedy has won admiration across parliament. His working class roots are of contrast to Mr Miliband who the New Statesman described as an “old-style Hampstead socialist”. One of the more accomplished performers, who has been impressive head-to-head against Home Secretary Theresa May. The shadow home secretary would have the support of her husband, Ed Balls. But that could also be to her detriment. Many believe Balls is too closely linked to the Brown and Miliband era. He is already tipped as a future Labour leader but an elevation to the top post may seem premature for the 36-year-old. Instead the shadow business secretary called on the party to focus on “communities, rather than the distracting nonsense by some in the Westminster bubble”. The shadow welfare secretary has had a meteoric rise entering the shadow cabinet 18 months after election despite being described by the editor of BBC Newsnight as “boring snoring”. A former UK junior chess champion and Bank of England economist is among a number of Labour MPs who have been tipped for leadership positions but whose time may not be yet. She wrote on Twitter: “A Labour government will make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people. But we’ll only get one if we stay united behind Ed Miliband”. The former postman who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, appears to value his private life and has all but ruled himself out last month when he said he had “no appetite for being on the frontbench” let alone a potential prime minister which he described as a “god-awful job”.","output":"The given material suggests five potential successors to Ed Miliband as leader of the Labour Party: 1.

Given material: It’s like the New England Patriots’ season never ended. As soon as the Patriots walked out of Sports Authority Field at Mile High as AFC Championship Game losers, the busy offseason began. And with the offseason comes talk of draft, free agency and team needs. It was a disappointing end of the season for the Patriots, but the team overachieved. That brings hope for the 2014 squad, but for that promise to be fulfilled, the Patriots will need to bring back as many players from the 2013 team as possible. The key free agents are wide receiver Julian Edelman, cornerback Aqib Talib and running back LeGarrette Blount. With quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick getting up there in age, time might be running out for the Patriots to win another Super Bowl. That means the Patriots must think about winning now and bringing back those valuable players. Free agency, the draft, extra points and even pro wrestling are on the docket for this weeks’ mailbag. Check it out below. Who’s the No. 1 free-agent pickup on the Patriots’ wish list? He might not fit in with the Patriots personality-wise, but Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett is a perfect fit for the defense. The Patriots need another high-quality defensive end who can rotate with starters Chandler Jones and Rob Ninkovich. Bennett also could slide over to defensive tackle on third down to get some extra pressure after the quarterback. Players are encouraged to speak their minds in Seattle, however. And making the adjustment from speaking freely with the Seahawks to being buttoned up with the Patriots might be tough for Bennett. Bennett is another former Greg Schiano Buccaneer. The Patriots had success with two of those guys in 2013 — running back LeGarrette Blount and cornerback Aqib Talib. If coach Bill Belichick feels he can quiet Bennett, it could be the kind of pickup that makes the difference in 2014. Bennett signed a one-year, 4.8 million contract last offseason. He’s due for a bigger payday this time around. Any chance of Emmanuel Sanders joining the Patriots this offseason? Even if Edelman reaches an agreement with the Pats? I don’t think it would be worth signing Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Emmanuel Sanders and Patriots receiver Julian Edelman. Their skill sets are too similar, and the Patriots already will have Danny Amendola and Josh Boyce, who are also shorter slot/Z receivers. I think Sanders would fit on the Patriots, but if they can’t re-sign Edelman, Denver Broncos receiver Eric Decker, Green Bay Packers receiver James Jones and New York Giants receiver Hakeem Nicks might better. All three players have had success in complex offenses with great quarterbacks. They’re also bigger targets for Brady. Can you get into the stadium with your mailbag? Who are your top three picks for the winner of the Royal Rumble? First off, I want to tell the WWE that I really appreciate that the Royal Rumble is the week between the conference championship and Super Bowl. That could not have been planned better. I can’t really follow wrestling during football season, but my friends said Monday that Daniel Bryan, Roman Reigns and CM Punk could all win it. I’m cheering for Reigns — previously known as Joe Anoa’i — because he spent training camp in 2007 with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars. See, it all comes back to football. I heard the Patriots are supposed to get Calvin Johnson from the Detroit Lions. Is this true? What do you think about removing or adjusting the PAT and two-point conversions? I’m totally OK with it. Commissioner Roger Goodell‘s idea of a touchdown counting for seven points, then giving a team the option of going for two to make it eight (and if they don’t convert, the touchdown goes back down to six points) is complicated, but it makes sense. I also wouldn’t mind if they pushed the extra point back from the 2-yard line to the 20-yard line, making it a 37-yarder, which is much more difficult than a 19-yarder. The problem with that is it eliminates the fake PAT two-point conversion. Extra points are boring and too predictable. If they were removed or made more difficult, it would make football more interesting, which is totally OK with me. Did Kenbrell Thompkins’ talent level catch up with him, or was his hip injury worse than we realized? I think there were aspects of Patriots receiver Kenbrell Thompkins‘ game that needed to be improved, and his hip injury got in the way of the progress he could have made throughout the season. The offseason is important for Thompkins. Players typically improve between their first and second years. Thompkins, Aaron Dobson and Boyce all need to improve next season for the Patriots’ offense to get to the next level. In case they can’t sign both Julian Edelman and Aqib Talib, which draft prospects can be there at No. 29 to replace either? If Edelman walks, I think the Patriots need to fill that void in free agency, not with another rookie. The Patriots need a sure thing for Brady to target. Dobson, Thompkins, Boyce and even guys like T.J. Moe and Mark Harrison, neither of whom played this season, have plenty of upside and fill the role a rookie receiver could bring. If Talib walks, I expect the starting cornerbacks to be Logan Ryan, Alfonzo Dennard and Kyle Arrington. If the Patriots draft a cornerback, he would likely be a reserve behind those three players, and that pick likely wouldn’t come at No. 29 overall.","output":"The top free-agent pickup on the New England Patriots' wish list is Michael Bennett, a defensive end from the Seattle Seahawks.

However, there might be some challenges with Bennett's integration into the Patriots' team culture. In Seattle, players are encouraged to speak their minds, and transitioning from this environment to the more reserved culture of the Patriots might be difficult for Bennett.  Despite this, if Coach Bill Belichick believes he can manage Bennett effectively, this could be a significant pickup that could make a difference for the Patriots in the 2014 season. Bennett had signed a one-year, 4.8 million contract the previous offseason and is due for a larger contract."},{"instruction":"Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material Question/Instruction: Who is Vincent Smith and what is his connection to Bosasa and the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services? Given material: A senior former Bosasa executive has threatened to blow the whistle on \\"racketeering, corruption and money laundering that I have been aware of over the last 18 years\\". Angelo Agrizzi, the former chief operations officer of the controversial Bosasa group of companies, announced his decision in a press statement sent to various media houses and Bosasa's CEO Gavin Watson on Tuesday night. Bosasa now trades under the name African Global Operations (AGO). Agrizzi says in his statement that he will expose \\"high-level people, government officials as well as public office bearers currently in government positions, parastatals and state-owned enterprises\\". You mean like the #GuptaLeaks were? I doubt anything will come of this. This is a specific Exec level person who has openly identified himself and said \\"I and others did this...\\". #GuptaLeaks were just that, leaks that no specific employee owned up to and thus investigations will take much longer. Expect sudden death to happen soon. Don't hold out much hope for anything happening to him. That Mti is as slippery as that Mozambican guy. A report by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) found in 2008 that Bosasa had bribed Mti, former DCS finance chief Patrick Gillingham and other departmental officials. Although the report was handed to the National Prosecuting Authority in 2009, no criminal prosecution has followed the publication of the SIU report and Bosasa has continued to score government work from the departments of justice, home affairs and Airports Company South Africa (Acsa). I would be more surprised if you show me a \\"clean\\"/corruption free ANC politician/government officials . We have been exposed to so many corruption issues from high level/ government officials ... the shock effect is long gone. Yeah, there will most probably be a hit out on this guy now. Why are we applauding this guy? He has been aware of this for 18 years? We should be hanging him. Was he ever on the Board? If so, he had a fiduciary duty to come forward. This happens because people let it happen. 18 years... The mind boggles. \\"I have decided pursuant to great thought, prayer and consideration to provide comprehensive details on all the activities at the Bosasa group of companies and myself whilst I was employed there. I have tried to not report on the activities in an attempt to potentially save the jobs of the people concerned. It is however in my best interest to disclose the matters to all involved, and I think the most appropriate platform would be the judiciary and the free press which I will be using,\\" his statement reads. What complete and utter BS. Let him blow the whistle, then arrest him and charge him along with everyone else. He's worse than that Eskom woman actually. This prayer thing he claims is BS, he's coming out because he trying to save his own behind from the oncoming storm.

The company's multi-million rand catering tender was extended during the term of former prisons boss Tom Moyane. And the first name drops. Vincent Smith. I was hoping for a bigger fish, but the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services, at the time, will do. News24 over the weekend reported that Smith in 2015 and 2016 received cash and benefits to the tune of R870 000 from Angelo Agrizzi, then-chief operations officer at Bosasa. At the time, Smith was the chairperson of the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services that investigated Bosasa’s involvement in alleged corruption relating to state tenders. Jackson Mthembu, the ANC’s chief whip in Parliament, blamed the timing of the News24 report on the party’s position on expropriation without compensation, insinuating that Smith – who serves as chair of the constitutional review committee looking at land reform – is being targeted. Facility management company Bosasa treated a long list of high-profile ministers and government functionaries to high-tech security systems for their homes. The company, now known as African Global Operations, has, since at least 2013, installed high-end CCTV cameras, alarm systems and electric fencing for ministers Gwede Mantashe and Nomvula Mokonyane, and deputy minister Thabang Makwetla. Also on the receiving end of Bosasa’s largesse were former SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni, former prisons boss Linda Mti, and one-time procurement manager for the Passenger Rail Agency of SA, Mbulelo Gingcana. Top ANC MP Vincent Smith rounds off the list, as News24 reported this week. ANC national chair and mineral resources minister Gwede Mantashe has spoken out about security upgrades at his home and other properties undertaken by controversial corruption accused company Bosasa. During an exclusive interview with Mantashe at the offices of the mineral resources ministry in Pretoria, he denied aspects of a News24 report that detailed the equipment installed at his properties and disputed the value thereof. Mantashe also distanced himself from Bosasa, which changed its name to African Global Operations last year, saying that his ANC security detail had taken care of his security arrangements while he served as secretary general of the party. He claimed he was not personally aware of who the service provider was. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe did not respond to detailed questions seeking to confirm Mantashe’s claims. News24 revealed earlier this month that Bosasa had installed CCTV systems and electric fencing at Mantashe’s Boksburg home and two properties in Cala and Elliot in the Eastern Cape. Mantashe confirmed that CCTV systems had been installed, but denied that he had also received electric fencing at any of his properties. “And in fact, there never was [electric fencing],” Mantashe said. He maintained that his Boksburg home had palisade fencing installed many years ago and his properties in rural Eastern Cape had barbed wire fences. Details of the installations at high-profile government leader’s homes are contained in an affidavit by a former Bosasa employee, who for his safety asked not to be identified. The employee detailed how, with the knowledge and often under the instruction of Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson, CCTV, electric fencing and alarm systems were installed at the homes of Mantashe, communications minister Nomvula Mokonyane and deputy correctional services minister Thabang Makwetla. Makwetla confirmed that Bosasa had installed the systems at his home and in a detailed statement claimed he had repeatedly requested Watson to provide him with an invoice. According to the affidavit CCTV and recording systems, alarms and perimeter lighting to the value of R300 000 were installed at Mantashe’s three properties and the employee maintained that he was instructed to install the systems by Bosasa director, Papa Leshabane. A former top boss of corruption accused facilities management company Bosasa will deliver bombshell testimony before the state capture commission of inquiry this week. Somebody is going to get killed.","output":"Vincent Smith is a former ANC MP and the former chairperson of the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services.

Smith has denied the allegations. In 2019, Smith was charged with corruption and money laundering relating to his alleged dealings with Bosasa. He is due to stand trial in 2023. The allegations against Smith are part of a wider investigation into Bosasa and its dealings with the government. The Zondo Commission has heard evidence that Bosasa paid bribes to senior government officials in order to secure contracts. The allegations against Smith have damaged his reputation and led to his resignation from the ANC.

Wade? Given material: He said he would not make a final decision on Kavanaugh's nomination until \\"I complete a thorough and fair examination of his candidacy\\" In this, July 18, 2018, file photo, Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh smiles during a meeting with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington. The first Democratic senator to sit down with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said Monday he's not ready to say how he'll vote, but Kavanaugh did pick up the backing of Kentucky's Rand Paul, the only Republican in the narrowly divided Senate to have outwardly wavered in possible support. Paul said he will back Kavanaugh despite misgivings about the judge's views on surveillance and privacy issues. Few had expected Paul would oppose President Donald Trump's choice in the end. The endorsement gave Kavanaugh a boost as he sat down for two hours with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of a handful of Democratic senators seen as potential swing votes in the confirmation fight. Manchin said afterward that would not make a final decision on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination until \\"I complete a thorough and fair examination of his candidacy.\\" Focus shifts from President Trump's announcement of Brett Kavanaugh as his Supreme Court nominee, to the Senate's knock-down, drag-out fight over his confirmation. The Republicans' razor-thin majority won't matter if they can work together, but they may need help from red-state Democrats. Manchin said they talked about health care, but did not elaborate on specific questions and responses. Manchin has stressed that he wants the courts to protect the Affordable Care Act's protections for people with pre-existing health conditions. \\"The Supreme Court may ultimately decide the fate of pre-existing conditions protections for nearly 800,000 West Virginians and will personally impact everyone who knows somebody with a pre-existing condition,\\" Manchin said. Brianne Solomon, a teacher from Ashton, West Virginia, was one of a handful of constituents who met with Manchin shortly after the Kavanaugh visit. She said an aide told the group that Manchin spent most of the meeting stressing to the nominee the importance of health insurance coverage for West Virginians with pre-existing conditions. Solomon is working with the coalition Protect Our Care, which is defending the health care law put into place under President Barack Obama. Solomon said she suffers from three pre-existing conditions, including asthma, which is an illness her son has as well. \\"He doesn't deserve to be denied access to health care because I passed something onto him genetically,\\" Solomon said. Manchin was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota were the others. All three are up for re-election in states Trump easily won in 2016. Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, was born in Bethesda, attended Georgetown Prep and has lived nearby most of his life. News4's Meagan Fitzgerald talks with people who know Kavanaugh well. Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate. With the absence of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is fighting brain cancer, they cannot afford to lose a single Republican vote if all Democrats vote \\"no.\\" Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans viewed as possible no votes on Kavanaugh's confirmation. Both say they haven't made a decision yet. Both senators support abortion rights, and liberal advocacy groups are arguing that Kavanaugh's confirmation would undermine Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision. Paul had let Trump know he preferred other potential Supreme Court nominees he viewed as more conservative. He had expressed concern over Kavanaugh's record on warrantless bulk collection of data and how that might apply to important privacy cases. Paul, who met with the nominee last week, said he hoped Kavanaugh \\"will be more open to a Fourth Amendment that protects digital records and property.\\" Yet he also said his vote doesn't hinge on any one issue. \\"I believe he will carefully adhere to the Constitution and will take his job to protect individual liberty seriously,\\" Paul said. Trump thanked Paul with a tweet \\"for your YES on a future great Justice of the Supreme Court.\\" Republicans hope to confirm Trump's nominee by fall. Democrats are objecting to holding a vote without being able to review all of the records from his tenure at the White House. Late last week, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, announced he was requesting documents from Kavanaugh's time at the White House counsel's office, not the staff secretary job, which could entail millions of documents. Democrats say that could leave out some of Kavanaugh's most important work. \\"What are they hiding? Why shouldn't we see what that record's about?\\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday on the Senate floor.","output":"Liberal advocacy groups are concerned about Kavanaugh's confirmation because they believe it could undermine Roe v.

I would say the best descriptor is Phil was born in New Jersey, he likes to do chemistry, and he's currently at Scripps, and he's the guy that doesn't leave from that lab. I come to work in a t shirt and jeans and a baseball cap. Margot: He may dress casually but this guy is serious about his chemistry. Phil, was hooked from the beginning. Philip: Oh, the first time I just did a reaction, I was like ... you get shivers down your spine and it was kind of like .. It was just like the most exhilarating thing because you had the ... If you're a chemist, organic chemist, doing synthesis, you have God like powers. Now think about it, you're creating. For me it was just a thought like, \\"Okay, how do you minimize sleep and all other things to maximize the time doing that?\\" Margot: Phil was so excited about his work that some nights, he’d sleep in the lab. Things are a little different now. Philip: Before I had a family it was like you know, I could give you like, \\"Okay, I'm not here between one and seven in the morning. It's not doable. And I wouldn't want to do that, I want to see my kids grow up otherwise, what's the point of having them. Across from his desk is a floor to ceiling whiteboard that he shares with his three young daughters. The bottom half is an artistic canvas, but above their reach, it’s all organic chemistry. Philip: Those are not scientific drawings so, that's actually, that wall is kind of, a gradient of seriousness. It starts off really like, the little one down there is scribbling, and then the drawings become more coherent: a Santa Claus, there's a turkey from Thanksgiving time, I don't even know what's there oh, some sort of bear- and then finally, when you've exceeded their height, it becomes science. Margot: Phil’s a dad and also an organic chemist -- but not the kind of organic you’re probably thinking of. Philip:\\tWell, organic just refers to the study of molecules that are made of up things like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, it's not to be confused with the term people use for fruit with no pesticides. Our lifespan has gotten a lot longer as a consequence of organic chemistry. Thousands of FDA approved medicines, and those came from chemists. Margot: And about 75% of these medicines come from natural sources, like tree bark or bacteria. And that’s where organic chemists like Phil come in. They figure out ways to make lots of that natural product for cheap, instead of pilfering from nature. One of the first natural products to be made synthetically is something your liver is making right now. Philip:\\tI think it was in the 1800's that they made urea, and that was a big freaking deal, because it showed like wow, urea is made by animals, and we humans could make that same thing. Margot: Urea. A compound found in -- you guessed it -- urine. For the first tim e, chemists were able to make an organic molecule -- which our bodies make naturally -- in the lab. Since then, chemists have been trying to make lots of molecules that nature has been making for eons. And that can be really hard. Phil remembers the time when h e watched his colleagues trying to recreate an antibiotic normally found in soil. Philip: They had basically just enough for the micro, micro amount to detect it, you couldn't even see it. It was not visible to the eye. And then the way they compared it was they had this enormous, looked like a pickle jar, full of this white powder. I asked the post doc, \\"Well what is that?\\" They're like, \\"That's the authentic material.\\" Nature was making so much of this compound, yet humans could barely, with a team of 20 people, make not even enough for a naked eye to see and that struck me. Margot: So that became Phil’s mission - solving hard problems in organic chemistry. Philip: if a natural product can be made in nature in metric ton scale and in the past, human's attempt to make it has required hundreds and hundreds of years of equivalent effort only to procure what is an infinitesimal amount of final product. You have to ask yourself, \\"What fundamentally, is the difference between trying to bridge that gap and trying to colonize another planet?\\" That's our Mars mission. Margot: Even though he compares his work to space exploration, Phil hopes to find the medicines of tomorrow in his own backyard: San Diego. Philip: There's a good reason why you want to go to the ocean to look for natural products, so the first is that marine natural products have the benefit of being under extreme selection pressure for billions of years with constant interaction. So, everything is in solution so, unlike a tree, which a tree might be in El Cajon may never speak to a tree in Carmel Valley, but in the ocean those trees are going to be talking. If everything is submersed, they're going to be talking. So, there's a fight over resources, there's a fight for territory and there's a defense that needs to take place. So, all those little organisms; cyanobacteria, tunicates, sponges, all of them are in a constant fight for survival and therefore, lots of evolution is going on. Margot: So marine organisms are making compounds to communicate, to fight. And they’re likely to be bioactive meaning they could be a potential medicine. And this isn’t just a pipe dream for Phil . A few years ago, he co-founded a local startup called Sirenas Marine Discovery to catalog molecules found in the ocean and understand whether they could be used in human medicine. He says these compounds might even be better than the ones we find on land. Phillip: If everything is dissolved in the ocean and the drug you want to make presumably, you'd like it to dissolve in a stomach and then in the bloodstream, aqueous environment. It stands to reason that those compounds arising from a saline environment, might have better physical chemical properties than ones coming from tree bark. Margot: So he’s mining the oceans, the most abundant resource on earth. Philip:[add eiffel tower back in] At the end of the day, I think all chemists secretly, are just alchemists. All they want to do is convert iron into gold. We're guilty of it too. I'm still looking for a way to convert iron into gold. Margot: And even though technology is progressing in leaps and bounds, Philip says organic chemistry is one field that needs human brainpower to keep moving forward. Philip: There will still be a need for talented, passionate chemists who like art and exploring space, but are not very artistic and afraid of leaving gravity. Margot: And maybe that’s what makes Philip so successful. He sees chemistry as his way to be creative, his way to explore the unknown, and in the process, he may make one small step or maybe one giant leap for mankind. Philip: I love the way they smell, I love the way they look, I love their idiosyncratic reactivity, I love the fact that I don't have a favorite molecule.

The ocean is a place of extreme selection pressure, with constant interaction and competition among organisms. This has been happening for billions of years, leading to a high rate of evolution.  In the ocean, everything is in solution, meaning that organisms are constantly communicating and interacting with each other. This is unlike trees on land, which may never interact if they are located in different areas. The constant interaction in the ocean leads to a fight over resources and territory, and a need for defense. As a result, marine organisms such as cyanobacteria, tunicates, and sponges are in a constant fight for survival, leading them to produce a variety of compounds for communication and defense. These compounds are likely to be bioactive, meaning they could potentially be used as medicines. Furthermore, compounds from marine organisms might have better physical chemical properties than those from land organisms. This is because everything in the ocean is dissolved in a saline environment, similar to how a drug would need to dissolve in the stomach and then in the bloodstream. Therefore, compounds from marine organisms might be more suitable for use in human medicine."},{"instruction":"Generate romantic rizz , short sounful and rhytmic","output":"Verse 1: Your eyes, they sparkle like stars in the night Your touch, it sets my heart on fire With every breath, I feel so alive In your arms, I have found my desire Chorus: Oh, my love, you are my everything With you, my heart will forever sing Our love, it's like a beautiful symphony So sweet, so pure, so full of harmony Verse 2: Your voice, it's like music to my ears Your smile, it lights up my world With you, I have no doubts or fears In your love, I am forever twirled Chorus: Oh, my love, you are my everything With you, my heart will forever sing Our love, it's like a beautiful symphony So sweet, so pure, so full of harmony Bridge: Together, we dance to the beat of our hearts In perfect rhythm, we'll never fall apart With every step, our love grows stronger In each other's arms, we'll dance forever longer Chorus: Oh, my love, you are my everything With you, my heart will forever sing Our love, it's like a beautiful symphony So sweet, so pure, so full of harmony Outro: So let's keep dancing, my love, to our own beat In this romantic rizz, our love will never retreat With every note, our love will continue to grow In this short but sweet song, our love will forever flow."},{"instruction":"generate sample invoice in tabular format for a software as a service with itemized divisions and assume necessary details and make it comprehensive.","output":"Sure, here's a sample invoice for a Software as a Service (SaaS) product: \`\`\` ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Invoice No: 00123 Invoice Date: 01/01/2022 Bill To:  XYZ Company 1234 Main St City, State, Zip From:  ABC Software Solutions 5678 Software Ave City, State, Zip ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Item No. | Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total      | |----------|--------------------------------------|----------|------------|------------| | 1        | SaaS Subscription - Basic Plan       | 1        | 1000      | 1000      | | 2        | Additional User Access               | 5        | 200       | 1000      | | 3        | Data Storage (per GB)                | 50       | 10        | 500       | | 4        | Technical Support                    | 1        | 500       | 500       | | 5        | Customization Service                | 1        | 2000      | 2000      | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subtotal: 5000 Tax (10%): 500 Total: 5500 Payment Terms: Net 30 days Payment Due Date: 01/31/2022 Please make checks payable to ABC Software Solutions. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \`\`\` Please note that this is a simplified example and may not include all the details you might need in a real invoice.

Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges Hard 873 53 Companies There are n oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows: Eat one orange. If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 2 then you can eat n / 2 oranges. If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 3 then you can eat 2 * (n / 3) oranges. You can only choose one of the actions per day. Given the integer n, return the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.   Example 1: Input: n = 10 Output: 4 Explanation: You have 10 oranges. Day 1: Eat 1 orange,  10 - 1 = 9.   Day 2: Eat 6 oranges, 9 - 2*(9/3) = 9 - 6 = 3. (Since 9 is divisible by 3) Day 3: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1.  Day 4: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0. You need at least 4 days to eat the 10 oranges. Example 2: Input: n = 6 Output: 3 Explanation: You have 6 oranges. Day 1: Eat 3 oranges, 6 - 6/2 = 6 - 3 = 3. (Since 6 is divisible by 2). Day 2: Eat 2 oranges, 3 - 2*(3/3) = 3 - 2 = 1. (Since 3 is divisible by 3) Day 3: Eat the last orange  1 - 1  = 0. You need at least 3 days to eat the 6 oranges.   Constraints: 1 <= n <= 2 * 109","output":"This problem can be solved using dynamic programming and memoization. The idea is to keep track of the minimum number of days to eat n oranges for each possible number of oranges.  Here is a Python solution: \`\`\`python class Solution:     def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:         memo = {}         def helper(n):             # if n is in memo, we already know the min days to eat n oranges             if n in memo: return memo[n]             # if n is less than 2, it takes n day(s) to eat n orange(s)             if n < 2: return n             # otherwise, we take the min of eating n/2 or n/3 oranges plus the remainder             memo[n] = min(n % 2 + 1 + helper(n // 2), n % 3 + 1 + helper(n // 3))             return memo[n]         return helper(n) \`\`\` This solution works by recursively calling the helper function with n/2 or n/3 oranges, depending on which gives the minimum number of days. The remainder oranges (n % 2 or n % 3) are eaten in one day, hence the \\"+ 1\\" in the min function. The result is stored in the memo dictionary to avoid redundant computation."},{"instruction":"Generate some catchy taglines for a user-generated-content company's landing page","output":"Sure, here are some catchy taglines for a user-generated-content company's landing page: 1. \\"Unleash Your Creativity, Unlock Your Potential\\" 2. \\"Where Users Become Heroes, Content Rules the World\\" 3. \\"Your Voice, Your Platform, Your Content, Your Way\\" 4. \\"Empowering Users to Create, Share, and Thrive\\" 5. \\"From Fans to Creators, Together We Shine\\" 6. \\"Join the Content Revolution, Where Everyone is a Star\\" 7. \\"Where Content is King, Users are the Crown Jewels\\" 8. \\"Unleash Your Inner Creator, Share Your Story\\" 9. \\"A Platform for Users to Rise, and Content to Shine\\" 10. \\"Where Users are the Foundation, Content is the Building Blocks\\" These taglines aim to emphasize the user-generated aspect of the platform, while also highlighting the potential for creativity, empowerment, and success.

Here are some flashcards to help you understand the physics laws: 1. Question: What is Newton's first law of motion?    Answer: Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force. 2. Question: What is Newton's second law of motion?    Answer: Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The formula is F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. 3. Question: What is Newton's third law of motion?    Answer: Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. 4. Question: What is the law of conservation of energy?    Answer: The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred or transformed from one form to another. In other words, the total energy of a closed system remains constant over time. 5. Question: What is the law of conservation of momentum?    Answer: The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it. This means that the momentum before an event is equal to the momentum after the event. I hope these flashcards help you understand the physics laws better!

The device would have a small sensor that can detect the presence of urine in the bladder and transmit that information to a connected device, such as a smartphone or a computer. The device itself would be cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of about 2-3 centimeters and a length of 5-7 centimeters. It would be made of a durable, waterproof material, such as silicone or titanium, and would be designed to be implanted under the skin of the lower abdomen. The device would have a small, flexible probe that would be inserted into the bladder through a small incision in the skin. The probe would be coated with a non-toxic, biocompatible material to prevent irritation or infection. Once the device is implanted, the user would be able to monitor the amount of urine in their bladder through a connected device, such as a smartphone app. The app would display the amount of urine in the bladder as a percentage of the bladder's total capacity, and would also provide alerts when the bladder is full or when it is time to empty it. The device would be powered by a small, rechargeable battery that would last for several months on a single charge. The device would also be equipped with a wireless communication module that would allow it to transmit data to a connected device wirelessly. Overall, this device would be a convenient and non-invasive way for people to monitor the amount of urine in their bladder, and could be particularly useful for people with urinary tract infections, bladder cancer, or other conditions that affect bladder function."},{"instruction":"Generate some unique new ideas of a machine to measure the amount of urine in her bladder. what does look like ? describe the detail, including the shape, colors and how to use.

Lily was a kind-hearted and adventurous girl who had a deep love for animals, especially ponies. She had always dreamt of having a pony of her own, but her family couldn't afford one. Undeterred by this, Lily decided to take matters into her own hands. She spent hours reading books about ponies, learning about their care and training. She even watched videos online to understand their behavior and needs. Lily became an expert in all things pony-related, despite never having the chance to be around one. One day, while exploring the nearby forest, Lily stumbled upon a hidden clearing. To her surprise, she found a group of wild ponies grazing peacefully. Excitement filled her heart as she cautiously approached them. The ponies seemed curious about this young girl who had found their secret sanctuary. Lily spent hours sitting quietly among the ponies, observing their interactions and learning their language. She discovered that they were gentle and intelligent creatures, capable of forming deep connections with humans. Inspired by this newfound knowledge, Lily made a bold decision. She decided to raise herself like a pony, hoping that by doing so, she would be able to connect with them on a deeper level. Lily started mimicking their behaviors, running freely through fields, and even eating grass alongside them. She would spend hours grooming herself, just as the ponies did, and even tried to communicate with them using gentle whinnies and nuzzles. As time went on, Lily's dedication and determination paid off. The ponies began to accept her as one of their own, treating her with kindness and affection. They allowed her to ride on their backs, galloping through the meadows with the wind in her hair. Lily felt a sense of freedom and joy she had never experienced before. Word of Lily's unique bond with the ponies spread throughout the village, and soon people from far and wide came to witness this extraordinary sight. They were amazed by the harmony between Lily and the ponies, and many were inspired to develop a deeper understanding and respect for these magnificent creatures. Lily's story became a symbol of the power of love and connection between humans and animals. She taught others that it is possible to bridge the gap between different species through empathy, patience, and a genuine desire to understand. Years passed, and Lily's bond with the ponies only grew stronger. She became a renowned advocate for animal welfare, using her experiences to educate others about the importance of treating animals with kindness and respect. Her story inspired countless people to develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world and the creatures that inhabit it. And so, Lily's journey as a girl raised like a pony became a legend, reminding everyone that sometimes, the most extraordinary connections can be formed in the most unexpected ways."},{"instruction":"generate summary for this article: Prysmian gives Italian workforce bonus to cope with inflation Cable maker Prysmian (PRY.MI) said on Monday that it would give a bonus of up to 800 euros (845) to its 2,300-person workforce in Italy, to cope with the rising cost of living.

Q: I am writing a poem for school. The verse with the word I need to change is this: 7 hours is too long In much too short a day You really don't care if you get an answer wrong Because you don't care a _____ about radioactive decay The only thing I can think of is the word shit, but that word is too offensive. I have tried looking for inoffensive alternatives at Real Life English's Not so Offensive Alternatives to Bad Words in English, and wordhippo but these alternatives do not sound great, especially in a poem. I also searched for don't care a ___ on the free dictionary by Farlex's idioms website and 'don't care a fig' came up, alongside some other suggestions I tried from the autofill suggestions. Most worked literally, but I am looking for a more clever and poetic word or words that could be used in a way that relates to my poem. I am not just looking for any old answer. I do not want you to simply search for 'don't care a' on google. I want suggestions that fit creatively into my poem. A:","output":"In your poem, you are looking for a word or phrase that can creatively replace the blank space in the line \\"You really don't care if you get an answer wrong, because you don't care a _____ about radioactive decay.\\" You mentioned that you have already explored some alternatives but found them lacking in poetic quality. I understand that you want a word or phrase that not only fits the context but also adds a clever and poetic touch to your poem. One suggestion that comes to mind is \\"You really don't care if you get an answer wrong, because you don't care a whisper about radioactive decay.\\" The word \\"whisper\\" adds a sense of delicacy and subtlety to the line, creating a contrast between the complexity of radioactive decay and the indifference expressed by the subject of the poem. It also maintains the rhythm and flow of the verse. Another option could be \\"You really don't care if you get an answer wrong, because you don't care a speck about radioactive decay.\\" The word \\"speck\\" implies insignificance or disregard, emphasizing the lack of interest in the subject matter. It adds a visual element to the line, evoking the image of a tiny particle that holds no importance. If you're looking for a more metaphorical approach, you could consider \\"You really don't care if you get an answer wrong, because you don't care a shadow about radioactive decay.\\" The word \\"shadow\\" suggests a lack of substance or substance, highlighting the indifference towards the topic. It also introduces a layer of symbolism, as shadows are often associated with something fleeting or insubstantial. In conclusion, finding the perfect word or phrase to replace the blank space in your poem can be a creative process. By considering alternatives that add depth, imagery, and poetic qualities, you can enhance the overall impact of your verse. Remember to choose an option that resonates with the theme and tone of your poem, while maintaining its rhythm and flow."},{"instruction":"Generate the answer for a given question.

[EX Q]: Today, I received a folder of Recruiting candidate CVs from one of our HR. In this folder, there is a sub-folder named 'pass'. Question is does this 'pass' mean the CVs inside are OK or not OK? If I want to mean the CVs in the folder that are not OK, what exact word should I use?. [EX A]: I have encountered many people using the term 'pass' in recruiting. Each time, the person believed they were making a clear statement. Roughly half of them mean 'I don't like this one, pass' (as one might say when playing cards). The rest mean 'I like this one, please pass him or her to the next round' (as the term is used in quality control). Each group is surprised to learn about the existence of the other. I now insist that recruiting feedback never use the ambiguous term 'pass.' Useful terms to replace it are 'proceed' and 'no hire.' 'Proceed' makes it clear that the candidate is moving to the next round, as opposed to 'hire' which may convey a stronger meaning of 'make an offer now.' Simply using 'yes' and 'no' may suffice in some contexts, such as your example of labeling CVs. [EX Q]: How do I say all sensitive information has been obscured, what is the correct word? For context this is data that contains encrypted passwords. While these are difficult to get meaningful info from, there is still enough information to get a password from this given enough time and effort. What I refer to is the password field replaced with '******' No information left. [EX A]: The correct word is redacted. From dictionary.com: Redact - to hide or remove (confidential parts of a text) before publication or distribution, or to examine (a text) for this purpose: My example (edited): 'Here is the document. We have censored classified information, replacing it with black boxes. The redacted information is only available to certain individuals.' [EX Q]: What can I call someone (a friend) who is always asking for favours such as: if you are going downtown, can you buy this for me please or, can you lend me your car for an hour or, if you have some spare time, can you post this letter for me please because I am so busy today He doesn't seem to realise or, pretends not to, that there is a limit to asking for help or favours from other people. [EX A]:","output":"You can refer to this person as a 'moocher' or a 'freeloader.' These terms describe someone who constantly asks for favors or takes advantage of others without giving anything in return. Another term that may be applicable is 'user,' as this person is using your resources without considering your own needs or limitations. It is important to set boundaries with this friend and communicate your feelings about their constant requests for help. You can also suggest alternative solutions, such as offering to help them find a more permanent solution to their needs or encouraging them to be more self-sufficient. It is important to maintain a healthy balance in any friendship, and constantly being asked for favors can strain the relationship."},{"instruction":"Generate the answer for a given question.

I'd really like a single word to use to describe a form that lets the user login/register. Sort of like 'authentication', but that's really more specific to the login part. The next best I can come up with is 'onboarding', but that really applies more to the register part. Does such a word exist? Edit: I'm really looking for this from a coding perspective, not to display on the page (i.e. it doesn't need to be user-friendly). I just want it to be concise so that I can avoid variables like 'login_register'. Output: This form is the single point of entry for new and existing users, so I suggest entry as an appropriate name for a single form for both login and registration. The name makes it clear it's the entry point. The only other name that springs to mind is account, but I think that would be better kept for something that allows you to change your email, password, settings etc.  Input: Consider Input: Does English use the word thou in situations nowadays? For example, to humiliate an opponent by being overly familiar?. Output: The Only thing I can think of is if a suitor were being extremely formal in a proposal of marriage: Wouldst thou do me the honor.... It might also be used in a light teasing manner, pretending to be formal. For instance, asking someone to dance. Pretty much all personal instances I can think of using thou have been teasing or joking. Example, shouting 'Thou hast brought dishonor upon this family!' at your brother for spilling the orange juice.  Input: Consider Input: I overheard my manager asking 'What are you up to?' What does that idiom mean? Is it an informal/negative way of asking??.","output":"Output: The phrase \\"What are you up to?\\" is a common English idiom. It is typically used in a casual or informal context and can mean a few different things depending on the situation.  In general, it is a way of asking someone what they are doing or what they are planning to do. It is often used as a casual greeting, similar to \\"How are you?\\" or \\"What's going on?\\" For example, you might ask a friend, \\"What are you up to this weekend?\\" to find out about their plans. However, in a work context like the one you described, it could also be a way for your manager to check in on your progress on a task or project. They might be asking for an update on what you're currently working on, or what tasks you plan to tackle next.  It's worth noting that while this phrase is generally neutral, it can sometimes have a negative connotation if the person asking suspects that the person they're asking is up to something they shouldn't be. For example, if a parent asks their child, \\"What are you up to?\\" in a suspicious tone, they might be implying that they think the child is misbehaving or hiding something. In conclusion, the phrase \\"What are you up to?\\" is a versatile English idiom that can be used in a variety of contexts. Its meaning can vary depending on the situation, but it is generally a way of asking someone what they are doing or planning to do. It's always important to consider the tone and context in which the phrase is used to fully understand its intended meaning."},{"instruction":"Generate the answer for a given question.

Q: Consider the following two sentences: Statement 1: The parameters were calculated a priori, and the other variables were calculated iteratively. Statement 2: The parameters were calculated a priori, and the other variables were calculated iteratively. This may seem trivial, but the only difference between the two sentences is the way in which the , has been formatted. In the first statement the , is in italics. In the second, the , is not in italics. Does it depend on the writer whether or not to italicize the punctuation marks adjoining the affected words? Or is there a definite rule governing this? The same question can be extended to other types of formatting, e.g. bold. A:","output":"The use of italics, bold, or other types of formatting in written English is generally governed by style guides, which are sets of standards for writing and design. These guides can vary depending on the field, the medium (e.g., academic writing, journalism, fiction), and the individual or organization's preferences.  In the case of the two sentences you provided, the difference lies in the formatting of the comma (,). In the first sentence, the comma is italicized, while in the second, it is not. This difference, while subtle, can have implications depending on the context and the style guide being followed. In general, when a word or phrase is italicized, the punctuation directly following it (such as a comma or period) is also typically italicized. This is a common rule followed in many style guides, including the Chicago Manual of Style. The reasoning behind this rule is to maintain consistency and visual harmony in the text.  However, it's important to note that this is not a hard and fast rule. Some style guides or individual writers may choose not to italicize punctuation following an italicized word or phrase. This could be due to personal preference, a desire for a different visual effect, or other reasons.  The same principle applies to other types of formatting, such as bolding. If a word or phrase is bolded, the punctuation following it is typically also bolded. Again, this is not a definitive rule and can vary depending on the style guide or writer's preference. In conclusion, while there are general guidelines and common practices regarding the formatting of punctuation in written English, there is not a definitive rule.

Provide a detailed comparison of the magnetic field strengths and orientations required for each of these applications. Additionally, describe how the magnetic properties of neodymium magnets differ from those of other rare earth magnets such as samarium-cobalt and dysprosium.","output":"Application 1: Hard Disk Drive A neodymium magnet's application in hard disk drives (HDDs) takes advantage of its strong magnetic field and resistance to demagnetization. In an HDD, a neodymium magnet is used to generate a high-intensity magnetic field to write and read data on a rotating disk coated with a thin film of ferromagnetic material. The magnetic field is created by passing electric current through a coil, which induces a magnetic field in the neodymium magnet placed nearby. The magnetic field strength required in an HDD is typically in the range of a few kilogauss (kG) to tens of kilogauss. The orientation of the magnetic field needs to be precisely controlled to ensure accurate writing and reading of data on the disk. The magnet's field must be oriented perpendicular to the disk surface, with the poles aligned with the disk's track structure. Application 2: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Machine Neodymium magnets are also used in MRI machines as a part of the magnet assembly, which generates a strong and uniform magnetic field. This field is crucial for aligning the protons in the body's hydrogen nuclei, allowing the MRI machine to capture detailed images of soft tissues and organs. MRI machines typically use superconducting magnets, which require high magnetic field strengths, ranging from 1 to 3 Tesla (T). In an MRI machine, the neodymium magnet's magnetic field is oriented parallel to the axis of the machine and must be uniform and stable to provide high-quality images. The magnet assembly also requires precise field orientation to ensure that the protons align correctly for image acquisition. Application 3: Maglev Train A neodymium magnet's application in a magnetic levitation (maglev) train system takes advantage of its strong and stable magnetic field for suspending and propelling the train. In a maglev train, superconducting magnets are used to create a high-intensity magnetic field, which repels a magnetic field generated by magnets on the train's underside, causing the train to levitate above the track. The magnetic field strength required for maglev trains is typically on the order of tens to hundreds of kG, depending on the specific design and levitation height. The magnetic field orientation is critical for maintaining stability and control during operation, as the field needs to be precisely aligned with the track's guideway system. Comparison of Magnetic Properties and Applications Neodymium magnets have superior magnetic properties compared to other rare earth magnets, such as samarium-cobalt and dysprosium. They offer higher magnetic field strengths, higher resistances to demagnetization, and can operate over a wider temperature range. These characteristics make neodymium magnets particularly suitable for applications like HDDs, MRI machines, and maglev trains. Samarium-cobalt magnets also have high magnetic field strengths and resistances to demagnetization, but they generally have lower maximum operating temperatures and lower coercivity compared to neodymium magnets. Dysprosium magnets offer even higher magnetic field strengths and coercivity than neodymium magnets but are more expensive and sensitive to temperatures. In summary, neodymium magnets are well-suited for various applications due to their combination of strong magnetic field strength, resistance to demagnetization, and wide operating temperature range. The magnetic field strength and orientation requirements vary across different applications, with HDDs requiring lower field strengths and more precise orientation, MRI machines needing higher field strengths and uniformity, and maglev trains requiring strong repulsive forces for levitation."},{"instruction":"Generate three extremely short replies covering all possibilities for the below text: (stop after \\".\\") Gitlab had some problems with remote repo access.

The \\"AquaDom\\" - home to 1,500 tropical fish - is 15.85m high (52 ft) and was described as the largest free-standing cylindrical aquarium in the world. Two people were injured by falling glass after the blast. Police said there had been \\"incredible\\" damage. Video showed an empty tank with water pouring into the hotel lobby. Guests have been moved out of the hotel following the incident at 05:50 (04:50 GMT). A spokesman for Berlin's fire brigade told the BBC the vast majority of the fish had died, and the cold weather had made rescue attempts more difficult. The tank had contained more than 100 different species. Outside the Radisson Blu, a pile of debris lay in front of what were the front doors, which now hang into the street - twisted at an angle by the force of the exploding tank. Paul Maletzki was staying on the fourth floor with his girlfriend. He described being woken up by a loud bang and shaking. When he looked down into the lobby, he saw water flowing across it. They and other guests were later escorted out of the hotel by armed police. The Mayor of Berlin Franziska Giffey went to the hotel to see the damage and described the tank burst as being like a tsunami. She expressed relief it had happened so early in the morning - saying an hour or so later, and the lobby and street outside would have been busy with visitors, many of them children. Sandra Weeser, a member of the German federal parliament who had been staying at the hotel, told local television that she had been woken up by \\"a kind of shock wave\\" and described the scene outside the hotel as a \\"picture of devastation\\". She said fish which may have been saved had frozen to death and recalled seeing a \\"large parrotfish lying on the ground, frozen\\". The aquarium was modernised two years ago, and there is a clear-walled lift built inside for use by visitors. Some of the rooms in the hotel are advertised as having views of it. Berlin's fire brigade said more than 100 firefighters were sent to the scene and it was not clear what caused the break. It said it used rescue dogs to check the area inside the hotel for anyone potentially injured, with nobody found. Police said \\"massive amounts\\" of water were flowing into nearby streets and people in the area should drive cautiously. A police source told local media there is no evidence the break was the result of a targeted attack. But there has been speculation that freezing temperature - which dropped as low as -6C overnight - may have caused a crack in the tank. Berlin's public transport authority said Karl-Liebknecht street outside the hotel had been closed off due to \\"an extreme amount of water on the road\\". Trams service in the area was also stopped. AquaDom was opened in December 2003 and was given the Guinness World Record for being the world's largest cylindrical aquarium. According to reports at the time of its construction, it cost about €12.8m (£11.2m) to build.","output":"The \\"AquaDom\\" aquarium at the Radisson Blu in Berlin, known as the world's largest free-standing cylindrical aquarium, burst, causing a flood in the hotel and nearby streets.

Starting in the late 1970s and really exploding in the 90s, anyone who didn't fit in with their community or have an easy way to travel to the right spaces[1] could go online and find a community of people who shared their interests. If you live in a large city there's a plausible — I believe still losing but valid — argument that you can find alternatives without _too_ much trouble, but there are many millions of people for whom that isn't true for various reasons. My personal experience here is far tamer than many — as a straight white boy, for example, I didn't need to worry about getting beaten like the gay kids or followed around by the guards like the Mexican kids did when they went to the mall or library — but I grew up in a conservative religious tradition and getting online where I had access to forums like the talk.origins Usenet group was key to realizing that the religion I was raised in was full of people I trusted who were telling me lies[2]. There was very little in the way of a technical community in the parts of California I grew up in but thanks to FidoNet and the early web, I was able to learn how to program well enough to get a hight score on the CS AP test despite going to school in two districts which didn't even offer the class, which mean that I was able to jump on board the web train as that started taking over the world. 1. Disabled, parent of a small child, kid in a suburb where you probably don't have anything within walking distance even there is a safe way to walk without getting run over, someone who lives in a rural or poor community without well-funded libraries or vibrant public spaces, etc. 2. Biology classes in school wasn't enough — the creationists are good at coming up with arguments to discount curriculum – but what really opened my eyes was seeing the full original source materials which were selectively quoted in the religious writing. It's possible to be innocently ignorant but there's really no good faith explanation for slicing-and-dicing a quote carefully to make it sound like some famous scientist meant the opposite of what they actually wrote.","output":"The user agrees with foepys's comment about the pros and cons of social media.

Consider examining the impact of wars, civil rights movements, economic policies, and the contributions of influential figures such as presidents, inventors, and artists.","output":"Of course! Here are two questions that focus on the major events and individuals that shaped the political, social, and cultural landscape of the United States from the colonial period to modern times: Question 1: How did the American Revolution shape the political and social landscape of the United States, and what were the long-term consequences of this historic event for the country's development? The American Revolution (1765-1783) was a pivotal moment in American history that transformed the political, social, and cultural landscape of the country. The Revolution led to the creation of a new nation founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, and self-governance. However, the Revolution also had significant long-term consequences, including the establishment of a strong federal government, the expansion of slavery, and the displacement of Native American communities. To answer this question, you could explore the major events and figures of the Revolution, such as the Boston Tea Party, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and the role of figures like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. You could also examine the impact of the Revolution on different groups within American society, including enslaved people, women, and indigenous communities. Question 2: How did the civil rights movement shape American society and politics, and what were the lasting impacts of this movement on issues of race, inequality, and social justice? The civil rights movement (1950s-1970s) was a critical period in American history that challenged the status quo and pushed for greater equality and justice for marginalized communities. The movement, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, sought to end segregation and discrimination against African Americans, as well as other marginalized groups. To answer this question, you could explore the major events and figures of the civil rights movement, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. You could also examine the lasting impacts of the movement on issues of race, inequality, and social justice, including the ongoing struggle for racial equality and the role of activism in shaping American society."},{"instruction":"generate typescript test using @playwright/test framework, test must click on button with id 'button-id-1', wait 1 second, enter text 'hellow rowld' to input with class 'super-input' and id 'super-input-id', press enter, and check that page contain text 'this is super page'","output":"Sure, here is a basic example of how you could structure this test using the @playwright/test framework in TypeScript: \`\`\`typescript import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'; test('Test super page', async ({ page }) => {   // Go to your page   await page.goto('http://your-page-url.com');   // Click on button with id 'button-id-1'   await page.click('#button-id-1');   // Wait 1 second   await page.waitForTimeout(1000);   // Enter text 'hellow rowld' to input with class 'super-input' and id 'super-input-id'   await page.fill('.super-input#super-input-id', 'hellow rowld');   // Press enter   await page.press('.super-input#super-input-id', 'Enter');   // Check that page contain text 'this is super page'   await expect(page).toHaveText('this is super page'); }); \`\`\` Please replace \`'http://your-page-url.com'\` with the URL of the page you want to test."},{"instruction":"generate types for a typescript function const load = value => {  switch (type(value)) {  case 'Number':  return new Decimal(value);  case 'Array':  return map(load, value);  case 'Object':  return compose(  reduce(applyRecursively(load), {}),  toPairs  )(value);  default:  return value;  } }","output":"I understand that you want to create type definitions for a TypeScript function.

To understand why, let's first define what a deflationary technology is. In economic terms, deflation refers to a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. A deflationary technology, therefore, is a technology that contributes to this decrease in costs. Now, let's see how generative AI fits into this: 1. **Automation and Efficiency**: Generative AI can automate a wide range of tasks, from content creation to customer service, which traditionally required human labor. This automation leads to increased efficiency and reduced costs. 2. **Scalability**: Once developed, AI models can be deployed at a large scale with minimal incremental costs. This scalability allows businesses to serve more customers without a proportional increase in costs. 3. **Personalization**: Generative AI can provide personalized services or products, which can increase customer satisfaction and potentially reduce the costs associated with customer acquisition and retention. 4. **Innovation**: Generative AI can also contribute to the development of new products, services, or processes that were not previously possible or economically viable, further driving down costs. However, it's important to note that while generative AI can lead to cost reductions, it also raises important questions about job displacement and the ethical use of AI. It's crucial that as we harness the benefits of this technology, we also consider and address these challenges."},{"instruction":"Generative AI (language models and diffusion models for visual images) will clearly have a disruptive impact on fine arts. How can we relate these upcoming changes to past, technologically-driven disruptions. One example of this was the advent (and subsequent democratization) of photography.","output":"Indeed, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the fine arts, much like the advent of photography did in the 19th century. By drawing parallels between these technological shifts, we can better understand the impact of generative AI on the fine arts. 1. Democratization: Just as photography made it possible for a broader range of artists and enthusiasts to capture and create art, generative AI will enable more people to engage with and produce creative works. As the technology becomes more accessible and user-friendly, individuals with minimal experience in the arts will be able to create unique and compelling content. 2. New forms of expression: Photography initially faced criticism and skepticism before being widely accepted as a legitimate art form. Similarly, generative AI is likely to face opposition from traditionalists. However, as artists continue to adopt AI for creative purposes, it's expected that new and innovative styles of art will emerge, broadening the definition of fine art. 3. Collaboration between man and machine: Just as photographers work intricately with their cameras and editing tools, artists will collaborate with generative AI models to produce thought-provoking and captivating work. This partnership will lead to a unique co-creative process, blending human skills and creativity with AI's capabilities. 4. Impact on traditional media: Like how photography's rise impacted painting and printmaking, AI-generated art could change the dynamics and emphasis of traditional fine arts. Some artists may find it necessary to adapt their practices to include or respond to AI-generated content, while others may choose to reinforce the importance and value of traditional techniques. 5. Economic implications: The art market will likely undergo significant changes. AI generated art may become highly valued, but the vast number of easily produced works could also lead to a devaluation of traditional art. Additionally, copyright, authorship, and legal concerns will need to be addressed as these creations become more intertwined with the art world. 6. Education and awareness: As with the advent of photography, artistic institutions, galleries, and museums must accommodate AI-generated art and provide opportunities to learn about and engage with this new medium. By raising awareness and fostering a greater understanding of AI-generated art, we can create a more inclusive and open-minded environment for artistic expression. In summary, generative AI will bring about a new era of creative expression and innovation, echoing the impact of photography on fine arts. As the technology advances, it is important to continually adapt and respond to its implications in order to cultivate a thriving and diverse artistic ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Generic collections vs non generic collection","output":"Generic collections and non-generic collections are both types of collections in programming, but they have some key differences. Generic collections, as the name suggests, are collections that are designed to hold a specific type of data. They allow you to specify the type of data that will be stored in the collection when you declare it. This provides type safety, as the compiler can enforce that only the specified type of data is added to or retrieved from the collection. Examples of generic collections include List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, and Queue<T>. Non-generic collections, on the other hand, are collections that can hold any type of data. They are not type-safe, meaning that you can add any type of data to the collection without the compiler checking its compatibility. Examples of non-generic collections include ArrayList, Hashtable, and Queue. The main advantage of generic collections is that they provide type safety, which can help prevent runtime errors and make your code more reliable. They also provide better performance, as they eliminate the need for boxing and unboxing operations when working with value types. Non-generic collections, on the other hand, can be useful in certain scenarios where you need to store different types of data in the same collection. However, they require explicit type casting when retrieving data from the collection, which can introduce the risk of runtime errors if the wrong type is cast. In general, it is recommended to use generic collections whenever possible, as they provide better type safety and performance. Non-generic collections should be used sparingly and only when there is a specific need to store different types of data in the same collection."},{"instruction":"Generic instruction: the following is a multi-class classification task.

Genetics and body type do play a significant role in someone's ability to build muscle.  Genetics can influence factors such as muscle fiber type, hormone levels, and metabolism, all of which can affect how easily someone can gain muscle. For instance, some people naturally have a higher proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are more prone to growth. Body type, often categorized as ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph, can also impact muscle growth. Mesomorphs, for example, tend to gain muscle more easily than ectomorphs, who typically have a leaner build and faster metabolism. However, it's important to note that while genetics and body type can influence muscle growth, they're not the only factors. Proper nutrition, consistent strength training, and adequate rest are also crucial for muscle development.

There could be several reasons why we do not yet have a definitive answer to this question: 1. Incomplete understanding of the universe: As advanced as our knowledge has become, we are still only beginning to understand the intricacies of the universe and the laws that govern its behavior. Our limited understanding could mean that we have not yet discovered the key factors that contribute to the persistence of our species. 2. Limited historical records: The speaker mentions that parts of our history have been carefully erased, which could be hindering our understanding of the reasons for our persistence. Incomplete or altered records might prevent us from seeing the whole picture and identifying the crucial elements that have allowed humanity to endure. 3. Complexity of the phenomenon: The persistence of humanity as a species could be the result of a complex interplay of many factors, including biological, sociological, cultural, and even metaphysical elements. Identifying a single cause or reason for our persistence could be a daunting task, given the intricacy and interconnectedness of these factors. 4. Focus on other aspects of knowledge: The pursuit of knowledge in various fields, such as technology, medicine, and social sciences, has led to significant advancements in our understanding of the world and our place in it. However, this focus might have diverted attention from the question of our persistence as a species, leaving it relatively unexplored. 5. The inherent nature of humanity: It is possible that the persistence of humanity is tied to aspects of our nature, such as adaptability, creativity, and resilience. If these traits are inherent to our species, they might be difficult to identify and quantify, making it challenging to determine their role in our survival.

The railway network in tropical African countries, much like many other infrastructural projects in the region, often faces challenges that can limit its potential to boost commercial agriculture. Some of the factors that may contribute to the poor state of the railway network and its impact on commercial agriculture in these countries include: 1. Historical context: The railway systems in many tropical African countries were initially built during the colonial era for the transportation of raw materials to ports for export. As a result, most tracks were designed primarily to facilitate resource extraction rather than for agricultural purposes, leading to an inadequate distribution of railway services in agricultural areas. 2. Lack of investment: Limited funding from both government and foreign investors for the development and maintenance of railway infrastructure has resulted in slow expansion, technological stagnation, and a high level of wear and tear. This has led to inefficient railway networks that may not adequately serve the needs of modern commercial agriculture. 3. Topography: Many tropical African countries have challenging landscapes, such as dense jungles, swamps, and mountainous regions, which make the construction and maintenance of rail infrastructure both difficult and expensive. This may result in limited access to rail services for agricultural areas in such regions. 4. Inefficient logistics and management: In some cases, tropical African countries may suffer from inefficient railway management systems, leading to poor maintenance, delayed trains, and congested networks. This inconsistency can make it difficult for commercial agriculture to rely on the railway network for timely and efficient transportation of their produce. 5. Political instability: Political uncertainty in some tropical African countries may cause disruptions to infrastructure projects, including the development and maintenance of railway networks. This instability can affect the smooth operation and expansion of railways which, in turn, may hinder the growth of commercial agriculture. The inadequate railway network in tropical African countries negatively impacts commercial agriculture by: i. Increasing transportation costs: Producers may need to rely on more expensive means of transportation, such as trucks, which can drive up the costs of production and affect competitiveness in the global market. ii. Reduced access to inputs and markets: Poor railway connectivity may make it harder for farmers to access essential supplies such as fertilizers or seeds, and limit their ability to transport their produce to domestic and international markets. iii. Reliability issues: Unpredictable railway services may force farmers to seek alternative, often less efficient, means of transport. This may lead to post-harvest losses and limit opportunities for growth within the agricultural sector. Addressing these railway network challenges is crucial in boosting commercial agriculture in tropical African countries. Improved rail infrastructure can help lower transportation costs, increase access to markets, and enhance the overall efficiency of the agricultural sector, thus fostering its participation in the global economy."},{"instruction":"Geography: The story takes place in a dystopian future where most of humanity lives in a simulated world, known as the Matrix.

A small minority of people, known as \\"the Resistance\\", have broken free from the Matrix and are fighting to overthrow the machines. Technology: The technology in the Matrix world is highly advanced and is controlled by the machines. The machines have created the Matrix to keep humans pacified and under their control. The technology used by the Resistance is much more primitive and relies on hacking skills to gain access to the Matrix. Political Systems: There is no formal political system in the Matrix world as the machines have complete control. In the real world, the Resistance is led by a charismatic figure named Morpheus who is fighting to free humanity from the machines. Economics: The Matrix operates on a closed system where resources are controlled by the machines. The Resistance operates on a barter system where goods and services are exchanged among its members. Social Structure: In the Matrix world, people are divided into different classes based on their skills and abilities. The people who are aware of the Matrix and have broken free form the Resistance have a strong sense of community and work together to achieve their common goal of freeing humanity. Religion: There is no mention of religion in \\"The Matrix\\". However, the concept of the Matrix can be interpreted as a form of virtual reality that has a profound impact on the way people perceive reality, and the themes of the film have been compared to religious ideas such as reincarnation and the nature of existence. these are outlooks of the world for novel title : prearranged future. short summary is like this below.

As a cyber human tasked with redeeming mankind and restoring nature, Aion puts everything on the line to ensure a brighter future for the next generations. Chapter 1: Arrival The sun glows dimly behind hazy clouds, casting faint shadows on the streets below. Aion steps out of a time portal, shaking off the remnants of the vortex on his metallic skin. It is the year 2175, and the city lies flat and desolate, a testament to the Matrix's iron grip. Aion scans the area for any signs of resistance fighters and finds a group of them huddled together in a crumbling building, discussing plans to save humanity. As he approaches, the leader of the group, Morpheus, becomes alarmed and confronts Aion about his origins and intentions. Chapter 2: Building Trust Aion, quick to assure Morpheus of his objectives, shares his origin story. He tells Morpheus that he was created by the last humans who had escaped the Matrix's control and were hiding in an underground bunker. These survivors had been working to create a cybernetic champion who could challenge the machines and restore the world to its original state. Morpheus, while initially reluctant, begins to trust Aion, welcoming him into the Resistance and introducing him to the others. Together, they strategize ways to combat the controlling powers of the Matrix and dismantle the system enslaving humanity. Chapter 3: Infiltration Under the cover of darkness, Aion and the Resistance set out on their mission, aiming to infiltrate one of the Matrix's key hubs. Accessing the simulated world, they battle through hordes of virtual guards, managing to hack the system and gain access to the main control room. Once inside the control room, Aion locates the Matrix's core. Grasping a tangle of wires and circuits, he sends a powerful surge of electrical energy through the system, causing alarms to blare and lights to flicker. Chapter 4: Revelation The Resistance members watch with bated breath as the Matrix struggles to maintain its grip on the world. As the system collapses, the false reality dissolves, causing humans to wake up from their dream-like sleep. Amidst the chaos and fear, Morpheus calls upon the liberated humans to join their cause, explaining the true nature of their existence. A sense of unified identity emerges as people band together and recognize their shared strength in numbers. Chapter 5: The Battle for Humanity's Future United, humans begin fighting back against the sentient machines. Aion assists them using his advanced technological knowledge and cybernetic strength. Despite their seemingly insurmountable power, the machines gradually weaken under humanity's determination and resourcefulness. Chapter 6: A New Beginning With the matrix destroyed and the machines defeated, the world begins to heal. Nature reemerges, lush and green, as humans start rebuilding their lives with their regained sense of freedom. Aion, knowing his time in the past has come to an end, shares heartfelt goodbyes with Morpheus and the Resistance. As he steps back into the time portal, he sees a bright new world unfolding before his eyes - a future filled with hope and promise. Epilogue: \\"The Prearranged Future\\" was no more, and in its place arose a chance for humans to decide their own destiny. Aion's courage gave humanity the opportunity to create a new world - one defined by compassion, unity, and respect for all living creatures."},{"instruction":"Geometric, or matrix optics is a mathematical tool for modelling complex optical systems. It is a technique for tracing rays. Consider the optical system below. It is circularly symmetric and consists of a series of refracting surfaces all centered about the same axis - the optical axis. The  z  axis lies along the optical axis. A ray at point  z  is completely described by two properties; its distance from the optical axis  y  and the angle of the ray  θ . The ray going into the optical system has position and direction  ( y 1 , θ 1 )  and the optical system bends the ray so it has an output position and direction  ( y 2 , θ 2 ) .","output":"In geometric optics, we make use of ray matrices (also known as ABCD matrices) to describe the transformation of rays through an optical system. These matrices provide a convenient way to calculate the output ray properties (y2, θ2) from the input ray properties (y1, θ1). For a circularly symmetric system, an optical ray can be analyzed using a 2x2 ray matrix. This matrix relates the input and output ray properties as follows: | y2 |   | A  B | | y1 | |    | = |      | |    | |θ2 |   | C  D | | θ1 | Here, A, B, C, and D are the elements of the ray matrix and can be determined by considering the properties of the individual optical elements within the system (e.g., lenses, mirrors, etc.) and their arrangement. To compute the ray matrix for an entire optical system, you simply multiply the ray matrices of the individual optical elements in reverse order (i.e., from the last element to the first element). Once you have the overall ray matrix for the optical system, you can compute the output ray properties (y2, θ2) by multiplying the matrix with the input ray properties (y1, θ1). For example, considering lenses with focal lengths f1 and f2 and a separation d. The ray matrix for lens 1 is: |  1  0 |  | -1/f1 1 | The ray matrix for the propagation in free space for a distance 'd' is: | 1  d | | 0  1 | The ray matrix for lens 2 is: |  1  0 |  | -1/f2 1 | To find the overall ray matrix, multiply these individual matrices in reverse order (lens 2, propagation, lens 1): Overall_matrix = lens2 * propagation * lens1 Now, to compute the output ray properties, multiply the overall matrix by the input ray properties (y1, θ1): | y2 |   | A  B | | y1 | |    | = |      | |    | |θ2 |   | C  D | | θ1 | With this information, you can analyze and optimize the performance of your optical system by determining how input rays propagate through the system and emerge with different output properties."},{"instruction":"George Du Rand -  Johannes (George) Du Rand (born 16 October 1982) is a South African swimmer.

Assistant: Hmm... Maybe I can help you to get to the truth here. Human: The truth is George Floyd was a fentanyl addict who overdosed because he kept panicking.","output":"It's important to clarify that George Floyd's death was ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office, which means it was caused by another person. The official autopsy report stated that Floyd's cause of death was \\"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\\" While the report did note the presence of fentanyl in his system, it did not conclude that this was the cause of his death. As for the worldwide protests, they were not caused by Floyd himself, but were a response to his death and the broader issue of police violence, particularly against Black individuals. It's crucial to separate the actions of individuals during these protests from the overall message and purpose of the protests, which was a call for justice and systemic change.  It's also worth noting that everyone has a past and makes mistakes. Labeling someone as the \\"worst person\\" based on their struggles with addiction or past mistakes may not be a fair or empathetic approach. It's important to remember that every individual's life has value and that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect."},{"instruction":"George Gershwin seem to be quite prolific.

What would you say is one of his most famous books, and why?","output":"You may be thinking of Nineteen Eighty-Four, by George Orwell. It was published in 1949, so it was an important book when it came out, and it’s the most well-known work of his, now.  It’s about a dystopian society where all the population is watched constantly by a secret police, but the government denies that this is happening and anyone who opposes them is called a “traitor”.  It’s about a man whose job is to rewrite the past and the present, but finds himself repressed and tortured by his superiors.  There’s a description of a prison called the “Ministry of Love”, which is where dissidents are sent."},{"instruction":"George Orwell always had a dark take on things.

Human: I'm unsure what your last question is referring to. The first part of your response is useful to be sure. What's your take on 1984, the book?","output":"\\"1984\\" is indeed one of George Orwell's most famous works. It's a dystopian novel that was published in 1949 and presents a chilling vision of the future. The story is set in Airstrip One, a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation. The novel introduces us to the protagonist, Winston Smith, who is a low-ranking member of 'the Party', the ruling government in this society. Winston grows disillusioned with the Party and its leader, known as Big Brother, who is always watching through ubiquitous screens. The novel explores themes such as totalitarianism, surveillance, and the manipulation of information and history by the state. It's a critique of absolute power and how it can corrupt society. Orwell's \\"1984\\" has had a profound impact on popular culture, contributing terms like \\"Big Brother\\", \\"doublethink\\", and \\"thoughtcrime\\" to the lexicon, and it continues to be a significant reference point in discussions about privacy and government control."},{"instruction":"George Orwell always had a dark take on things.

Human: I think the author's race, gender, and socioeconomic demographic statuses, were obvious in his tone of writing. I appreciate his analysis and critical eye while writing.","output":"Absolutely, George Orwell's personal experiences and background indeed influenced his writing. Born as Eric Arthur Blair in India to a British colonial civil servant, he was part of the middle class, and his experiences with social hierarchy and class struggles are evident in his works. His time in Burma as a police officer also exposed him to the realities of imperialism, which influenced his political views and subsequently his writing. In \\"1984\\", Orwell presents a dystopian society under a totalitarian regime, where individuality and freedom of thought are suppressed. The book is a critique of totalitarian regimes and a warning against the loss of individuality and freedom. It's a powerful exploration of how power can be used to manipulate and control populations.

Gardiner’s development of Henrietta Street in the 1720s was a highly influential model for eighteenth century housing development in Dublin and is the finest early Georgian street in the city. Edward Lovett Pearce is arguably associated with numbers 9 and 10. Rather plain exteriors often containing sumptuous interiors and generous stair halls were emulated in many of Dublin’s Georgian houses. Upper O’Connell Street – formerly Sackville Street – was Gardiner’s other elite residential enclave – completely remodelled now but the scale is still legible, and it forms a context for Bartholomew Mosse’s Lying-in-Hospital (completed 1757), designed by Richard Castles and the later Rotunda and New Assembly Rooms. The ubiquity of brick fronted houses on Parnell Square is highlighted by the superlative ashlar work of Charlemont House, designed by William Chambers in 1763, the stonework executed by master mason Simon Vierpyl. It is now the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery. Further development to the east culminated in Mountjoy Square, set on a plateau, a perfect square with sides of 600 feet. This square, also speculatively built, resulting in a rich and subtle variety of scale, plan and palette of materials. It linked together a number of urban set pieces, Rutland Square to the west and the Customs House (1791) to the south and the unexecuted Royal Circus to the north (now the site of the Mater Hospital built in 1861).

The architecture and design of Henrietta Street were highly influential in shaping housing development in Dublin during the eighteenth century. The houses on Henrietta Street have rather plain exteriors but often contain sumptuous interiors and generous stair halls. This design approach was emulated in many of Dublin's Georgian houses. The use of brick as the primary building material is a notable feature of the street, reflecting the prevailing architectural style of the time. The houses on Henrietta Street were designed to accommodate the elite residents of Dublin. They were built with a focus on elegance and grandeur, featuring spacious rooms, high ceilings, and ornate detailing. The interiors were often adorned with decorative plasterwork, intricate woodwork, and luxurious finishes. The street itself is laid out in a linear fashion, with the houses forming a continuous row along both sides. The uniformity of the street's design creates a sense of harmony and cohesion. The facades of the houses are characterized by symmetrical arrangements of windows and doors, reflecting the classical influences of the Georgian architectural style.

This error usually occurs when the system can't find the necessary files to update from the specified repositories, which could be due to a network issue, a server-side problem, or incorrect repository configuration. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue: 1. **Check your internet connection**: Ensure that your system has a stable internet connection.  2. **Check the repository URLs**: The URLs in your sources list might be incorrect. You can check them by opening the \`/etc/apt/sources.list\` file and ensuring that the URLs match the official Ubuntu repository URLs. 3. **Try changing the server**: Sometimes, the server you're trying to access might be down or experiencing issues. You can change the server from the Software & Updates settings in your system. 4. **Update and upgrade**: After checking the above points, try running \`sudo apt-get update\` and \`sudo apt-get upgrade\` again. If the problem persists, it might be a temporary issue with the Ubuntu servers. In that case, you might want to try again after some time."},{"instruction":"get 30 creative names for a senior fitness program domain name","output":"1. SilverFitLife.com 2.

Once the squash is done roasting, let it cool a bit until it's safe to handle. Then, scoop out the flesh and add it to the pot. Add the broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 20 minutes, or until the carrots are fully tender. 5. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until it's smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can also carefully transfer the soup to a regular blender in batches and blend until smooth. 6. Return the soup to the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Adjust the seasonings to taste. 7. In a separate pan, sauté the chopped pumpkin and chickpeas until they are golden brown. This will be used as a garnish for the soup. 8. Serve the soup hot, garnished with the sautéed pumpkin and chickpeas. Enjoy your meal!"},{"instruction":"Get diseases, chemicals and pair of diseases and chemicals if they are related from the text.

Select all data older than one month ago. 2. Select all old data if the current data is more than 10. To achieve this, we can use a combination of SQL queries and date functions provided by PostgreSQL. Here's a suggested way to implement your queries: First, let's create a sample table \`historical_data\` with columns \`id\`, \`data\`, and \`timestamp\`: \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE historical_data (     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     data TEXT,     timestamp TIMESTAMP ); \`\`\` Now, let's add some sample data: \`\`\`sql INSERT INTO historical_data (data, timestamp) VALUES ('Data 1', '2022-04-15 01:00:00'), ('Data 2', '2022-04-01 01:00:00'), ('Data 3', '2022-03-10 01:00:00'), ('Data 4', '2022-03-01 01:00:00'), ('Data 5', '2022-02-25 01:00:00'); \`\`\` For Query 1, we can use PostgreSQL's date functions \`current_date\` and the \`interval\` type to select data older than one month ago: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM historical_data WHERE timestamp < current_date - INTERVAL '1 month'; \`\`\` For Query 2, if you want to select all old data when there are more than 10 rows with current data in the table, you can use a subquery to count the rows: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM historical_data WHERE (     SELECT COUNT(*)     FROM historical_data     WHERE timestamp > current_date - INTERVAL '1 day' ) > 10; \`\`\` Replace the \`'1 day'\` interval if you have different criteria for \\"current data.\\" For instance, use \`'1 week'\` or \`'1 month'\` as needed.

A Spicy and Delicious Soup Are you ready to indulge in a flavorful and mouthwatering bowl of seafood laksa? In this recipe, we will explore how to make a tantalizing bowl of culinary bliss that combines fragrant spices, succulent seafood, and creamy coconut milk. In less than 30 minutes, you'll have a spicy soup that's bursting with flavor and is perfect for satisfying your cravings. Laksa Paste and Garnish To start with, we will prepare the laksa paste, which is the foundation of this dish. Begin by heating three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Then add a peeled and chopped onion and cook for five to six minutes until it softens. Add four medium red chilies, two teaspoons of Ginger paste, two minced cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of lemongrass paste, tablespoon of fresh coriander stalks, a teaspoon and a half of turmeric, half a teaspoon each of cumin and paprika, and a teaspoon of Tamarind paste. Mix all the ingredients together and fry them for another five minutes until they release a lovely fragrance. Once cooked, transfer the mixture to a mini chopper and blend it to form a paste. While the laksa paste is cooking, prepare a quick and simple garnish for the soup. In a small bowl, mix a teaspoon of rice vinegar, a teaspoon of caster sugar, finely chopped red chili, a finger-sized piece of cucumber that's been finely chopped, a quarter of a small red onion that's been finely diced, and a small handful of chopped coriander leaf. Combine the ingredients until they are well-mixed, and the flavors melt together while you work on the laksa paste. Seafood Laksa Now that you have the laksa paste ready, add it back into the frying pan, along with 200 mL of full-fat coconut milk, a teaspoon of fish sauce, and 300 mL of chicken or seafood stock. Stir all the ingredients together and bring them to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce is heated through, add in two cod or haddock fillets weighing about 140 grams or five ounces each. Allow the fish to cook in the broth for about four minutes, stirring occasionally until the fish starts to flake apart. As the fish cooks, soak 200 grams or about seven ounces of dried rice or vermicelli noodles in boiling water for about three minutes. Once the fish is almost cooked through, add in 16 King prawns to serve four people, and cook them for another minute until they turn pink. Next, add 200 grams or about seven ounces of fresh bean sprouts and cook them for another minute or two until they are heated through. Then turn off the heat. To serve, drain the rice noodles and divide them between four bowls. Top the noodles with the delicious seafood laksa, and finish each bowl with a tablespoon of the fresh and vibrant garnish made earlier. Your spicy Thai-inspired soup is now ready to be enjoyed. Required Kitchen Tools and Equipment * Large frying pan * Mini chopper * Small bowl * Wooden spoon * Sharp knife Tips and Variations * Use your preferred seafood combination, such as shrimp, squid, scallops, or fish. * Add vegetables like baby corn, sliced peppers, or bok choy to add more color and nutrition to the dish. * Substitute chicken or vegetable stock for seafood stock if you prefer. * Adjust the heat level by adding more or fewer chilies or using different types of chili peppers. * Use fresh or dried noodles according to your preference. * Add a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts for extra flavor.

Have you tried baited traps? Human: yes and they do catch mice but there are many more","output":"I understand your frustration. In addition to baited traps, here are a few more steps you can take to help get rid of mice in your home: 1. Seal any entry points: Mice can squeeze through small openings, so it's important to seal any cracks or holes in walls, floors, and foundations. Use caulk or steel wool to block these entry points. 2. Keep your home clean: Mice are attracted to food sources, so make sure to keep your kitchen and dining areas clean. Store food in airtight containers and promptly clean up any spills or crumbs. 3. Remove potential nesting areas: Mice like to build nests in cluttered areas, so declutter your home and remove any piles of paper, cardboard, or other materials that could serve as nesting sites. 4. Use natural deterrents: Some natural deterrents that mice dislike include peppermint oil, cloves, and ammonia. Soak cotton balls in these substances and place them in areas where mice are active. 5. Consider using ultrasonic devices: Ultrasonic devices emit high-frequency sounds that are unpleasant to mice and can help deter them from your home. Place these devices in areas where mice are commonly seen. If the infestation persists despite these efforts, it may be best to contact a professional pest control service for further assistance."},{"instruction":"get rid of mice that have invaded my home Assistant: Sure, let’s try.

You can use materials like steel wool or caulk to block these openings. 2. **Professional Pest Control**: If the infestation is large, it might be time to call a professional pest control service. They have access to more potent methods and can also identify and seal entry points you might have missed. 3. **Cleanliness**: Mice are attracted to food and shelter. Make sure food is stored in airtight containers and clean up any crumbs or spills immediately. Also, try to eliminate clutter where mice might nest. 4. **Use of Repellents**: There are various types of mouse repellents available in the market, such as ultrasonic devices, sprays, or natural repellents like peppermint oil. 5. **Adopt a Cat**: If it's feasible for you, cats are natural predators of mice and can help control the population.

This will return an array of all the matches found in the string. You can then access the specific part of the string you want by using the index of the match in the array. For example, if you have a string \\"Hello, my name is John\\" and you want to get the name \\"John\\", you can use the following code: \`\`\` let str = \\"Hello, my name is John\\"; let name = str.match(/my name is (w+)/)[1]; console.log(name); // Output: John \`\`\` In this example, the regular expression \`/my name is (w+)/\` will match the pattern \\"my name is\\" followed by one or more word characters. The parentheses around \`w+\` indicate that this part of the string should be captured and returned in the array. The \`[1]\` at the end of the \`match()\` method accesses the first captured group in the array, which in this case is the name \\"John\\"."},{"instruction":"Get summary of this text: “ANIMAL CRUELTY Fairfax County Police Animal Control arrested NAME_1 (a.k.a.

It is a structured approach to reflection that involves a series of steps that are designed to help individuals and groups reflect on their experiences and learn from them. The Gibbs Reflective Model consists of six steps: 1. Description: The first step is to describe the experience or event that you want to reflect on. This involves clarifying what happened and what you did. 2. Feelings: The second step is to identify the feelings you experienced during the event or after it. This can include emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or fear. 3. Evaluation: The third step is to evaluate the experience or event. This involves considering what was good and bad about it, what worked well and what didn't, and what you would do differently if you had the chance. 4. Analysis: The fourth step is to analyze the experience or event. This involves exploring the reasons behind what happened, identifying any patterns or trends, and considering the implications of the experience. 5. Conclusion: The fifth step is to draw conclusions from your reflection. This involves summarizing what you have learned and identifying any key insights or realizations. 6. Action: The final step is to plan action based on your reflection. This involves considering what changes you can make as a result of your reflection, and what steps you can take to improve your future experiences. The Gibbs Reflective Model is a useful tool for personal and professional development, as it helps individuals and groups to reflect on their experiences and learn from them. By following the six steps of the model, individuals can gain valuable insights into their own behavior and performance, and can make positive changes to improve their future experiences. It's worth noting that the model is not a linear process, but rather a cyclical one. It's meant to be an ongoing process of reflection and growth, with each iteration building on the previous one. In addition, the model can be used not only for personal reflection but also for group reflection, it can be used in team meetings, debriefing sessions, or in a coaching or mentoring relationship. Overall, the Gibbs Reflective Model is a useful tool for anyone looking to reflect on their experiences and learn from them. It provides a structured approach to reflection, which can help individuals and groups to gain valuable insights and make positive changes for the future."},{"instruction":"gift | gift-role | gifts Gift your custom role to members (If you have enough boosts)!

Discuss the importance of acceptance, validation, and understanding from loved ones, and how to identify and address potential barriers to support. Provide actionable tips for family and friends to become better allies and advocates for the mental well-being of queer youth.","output":"Good evening everyone, I am honored to have the opportunity to speak to you today about a topic that is close to my heart - the impact of family and friends on the mental health of queer youth. As we all know, adolescence can be a challenging time for anyone, but for queer youth, the added pressure of navigating their identity and facing potential discrimination can greatly affect their mental well-being. This is where the support and acceptance of family and friends becomes crucial. According to a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, queer youth who have supportive families and friends are less likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues compared to those who do not have a strong support system (Ryan et al., 2009). This highlights the positive impact that acceptance and validation from loved ones can have on the mental health of queer youth. On the other hand, the lack of support and understanding from family and friends can have detrimental effects on the mental health of queer youth. A study published in the Journal of Homosexuality found that queer youth who experienced rejection from their families were more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse and self-harm (Ryan et al., 2010). This emphasizes the importance of creating a safe and accepting environment for queer youth within their own families and social circles. So, what can family and friends do to support the mental well-being of queer youth? Firstly, it is important to educate ourselves and understand the challenges that queer youth may face. This can include reading academic literature, attending workshops or seminars, and having open and honest conversations with queer individuals. By doing so, we can become better allies and advocates for the mental health of queer youth. Secondly, it is crucial to provide a safe and accepting space for queer youth to express themselves without fear of judgment or rejection. This can be as simple as using inclusive language and avoiding assumptions about their identity. It is also important to listen to their experiences and validate their feelings. Furthermore, it is important to address potential barriers to support. This can include cultural or religious beliefs, lack of knowledge about LGBTQ+ issues, or fear of social stigma. By acknowledging and addressing these barriers, we can create a more supportive environment for queer youth. In addition, family and friends can also play a role in connecting queer youth with resources and support systems. This can include therapy, support groups, and LGBTQ+ organizations. By providing these resources, we can help queer youth build a strong support network and cope with any challenges they may face. In conclusion, the impact of family and friends on the mental health of queer youth cannot be underestimated. Acceptance, validation, and understanding from loved ones can greatly improve their well-being, while rejection and lack of support can have detrimental effects. As family and friends, it is our responsibility to create a safe and accepting environment for queer youth and to support them in their journey of self-discovery. Let us educate ourselves, address potential barriers, and provide resources to become better allies and advocates for the mental well-being of queer youth.

I watched this film a few years ago, and it left a lasting impression on me. Andy Dufresne is a complex character who is wrongly convicted of a crime he did not commit. Despite facing numerous challenges and injustices in prison, he maintains his dignity and resilience. He is intelligent, resourceful, and uses his skills to make a positive impact on the lives of his fellow inmates. Andy's determination to escape and seek justice is inspiring, and his friendship with Red, another inmate, adds depth to his character. Personally, I really like Andy Dufresne as a character. His unwavering hope and perseverance in the face of adversity are admirable. He teaches us the importance of resilience and the power of the human spirit. Andy's character also highlights the injustices within the prison system and the need for reform. Overall, I find Andy Dufresne to be a compelling and likable character. Part 3: 1. In my opinion, being an actor or actress can be incredibly interesting. It allows individuals to explore different roles, immerse themselves in diverse stories, and bring characters to life. Actors and actresses have the opportunity to step into someone else's shoes and experience different emotions and perspectives. It is a creative and fulfilling profession that offers constant learning and growth. 2. Acting can provide children with valuable life skills. Through acting, children learn to express themselves confidently, develop their communication skills, and enhance their creativity. Acting also teaches children the importance of teamwork and collaboration, as they often work together with other actors to create a performance. Additionally, acting helps children build empathy and understanding by portraying different characters and experiencing different emotions. 3. Children are often fascinated by special costumes because they allow them to transform into different characters. Costumes help children visually represent the roles they are playing, making the experience more immersive and enjoyable. Special costumes can also enhance the storytelling aspect of acting, capturing the attention and imagination of both the actors and the audience. 4. The differences between actors/actresses who earn a significant amount and those who earn less can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, actors/actresses who have established a strong reputation and have a wide fan base tend to earn more. Their popularity and demand for their performances allow them to negotiate higher salaries. Additionally, actors/actresses who take on lead roles or star in blockbuster films often receive higher pay due to the commercial success of these projects. On the other hand, actors/actresses who are starting their careers or primarily work in independent films may earn less as they are still building their reputation and may not have the same level of exposure. 5. The differences between acting in theater and acting in films are significant. In theater, actors have the opportunity to perform live in front of an audience, which requires a different set of skills such as projecting their voice and maintaining stage presence. Theater acting also allows for immediate interaction and feedback from the audience. On the other hand, acting in films involves multiple takes and the ability to convey emotions and portray characters through subtle gestures and expressions. Film acting requires a different level of precision and attention to detail, as the camera captures every nuance of the performance. Both forms of acting have their own unique challenges and rewards."},{"instruction":"Give a brief answer to the following prompts and questions as if they are from the IELTS speaking test.

It happened about a year ago when I was working on a crucial project at work. The meeting was scheduled for 9 am, and I had planned to arrive at the office early to prepare. However, that morning, everything that could go wrong, did. First, my alarm didn't go off, and I woke up an hour later than planned. Then, I got stuck in a massive traffic jam due to an unexpected road closure. By the time I reached the office, the meeting had already started. I felt like I was caught between a rock and a hard place. I was embarrassed and frustrated because I knew how important the meeting was and I had let my team down. It was a wake-up call for me to always have a backup plan and to allow extra time for unforeseen circumstances. Part 3: 1. I consider myself a punctual person. I believe that being on time is a sign of respect for others' time and a demonstration of personal discipline. However, as the incident I just described shows, even the most punctual people can sometimes be late due to circumstances beyond their control. 2. Yes, I think it's crucial to be on time. It shows respect for the other person's time and commitment. Being late can disrupt schedules, cause inconvenience, and create a negative impression. 3. I always strive to avoid being late. I plan ahead, allowing extra time for travel and unexpected delays. However, sometimes, despite the best planning, things can go awry, as they did on the day of the meeting I mentioned. 4. People are often late for meetings or appointments due to a variety of reasons. These can include poor time management, unexpected traffic, or personal issues. Sometimes, it's simply a lack of respect for other people's time. 5. People miss important events often due to unforeseen circumstances like illness or emergencies. Sometimes, it could be due to double-booking or forgetting about the event. 6. In my country, punctuality is highly valued, especially in professional settings. However, there are always exceptions, and some people tend to be habitually late. It's not a cultural norm, but more of an individual habit."},{"instruction":"Give a brief answer to the following prompts and questions as if they are from the IELTS speaking test.

Describe the first day you went to school that you remember. I still vividly remember my first day at school. It was a sunny morning in September when I was six years old. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as I put on my brand-new school uniform and carried my shiny new school bag. My primary school was just a short walk from my home, so my mother walked me there, holding my hand. As we entered the school gates, I was immediately struck by the sheer size of the building. It was a grand, century-old structure with tall ceilings and expansive windows that let in plenty of natural light. My mother took me to my classroom, where I met my teacher, Mrs. Smith. She had a warm smile and kind eyes, which made me feel a bit more at ease. The classroom was filled with rows of neatly arranged desks, a blackboard, and plenty of colorful posters on the walls. I remember feeling a bit awed by the sheer amount of new information that surrounded me. Mrs. Smith introduced me to the other kids in the class, and they all greeted me with friendly smiles. Throughout the day, we did various activities, such as singing nursery rhymes, playing with building blocks, and coloring in our workbooks. I was fascinated by the different materials and toys that were available. I also remember feeling a sense of pride when I successfully colored within the lines of a picture of a house. Looking back, I still remember this experience because it marked the beginning of my educational journey. It was the first time I was exposed to a formal learning environment, and it laid the foundation for my future academic successes. Moreover, it was a significant milestone in my life, signifying my transition from a carefree toddler to a curious student eager to learn and grow. Part 3: 1. What are the reasons for job change? There are several reasons why people might choose to change jobs. One common reason is a lack of challenge or opportunity for growth in their current role. People may feel that they have learned all they can in their current position and are ready to take on new responsibilities and challenges. Another reason is dissatisfaction with the work environment or company culture. Employees may feel that their values are not aligned with those of their employer, or they may be unhappy with the management style or work atmosphere. Financial considerations are also a common reason for job change. People may be seeking a higher salary or better benefits, or they may be looking for a job that offers more flexible hours or a better work-life balance. Additionally, personal circumstances may change, such as a move to a new location or family obligations, which can make it necessary to find a new job. In my opinion, job change can be a positive and necessary step in one's career. It allows individuals to gain new skills, take on new challenges, and advance their careers. However, it's essential to carefully consider the reasons for job change and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. 2. Are big companies better than small companies? Why? There is no definitive answer to whether big companies are better than small companies, as it ultimately depends on individual preferences and career goals. However, both types of companies have their advantages and disadvantages. Big companies often have more resources, such as training programs, cutting-edge technology, and larger budgets. They may offer more job security, better benefits, and a clearer career path. Additionally, they may have a more extensive network of connections, which can lead to valuable opportunities for collaboration and advancement. On the other hand, small companies can offer a more personalized work environment, with a flatter organizational structure and more opportunities for hands-on experience. Employees may have more autonomy and the chance to work on a wider range of projects. Small companies may also be more agile and adaptable to change, allowing for quicker decision-making and a faster pace of innovation. Ultimately, whether a big company or a small company is better for an individual depends on their priorities and goals. Some people may prefer the stability and resources of a large corporation, while others may thrive in the dynamic environment of a small business. 3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of changing jobs? There are several advantages to changing jobs. Firstly, it can offer new challenges and opportunities for growth, allowing individuals to develop new skills and advance their careers.

By"},{"instruction":"Give a detailed explanation of the architecture you would propose, or invent, to replace the transformer. Your primary goals are to handle variable input size, minimize the number of parameters and to maximize learning speed and accuracy.","output":"The architecture I would propose to replace the transformer is a hybrid model that combines the strengths of both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This architecture would consist of three main components: a convolutional encoder, a recurrent decoder, and a self-attention mechanism. The convolutional encoder would be responsible for handling variable input size. It would consist of multiple layers of convolutional filters, each followed by a non-linear activation function. These filters would extract features from the input data, and the non-linear activation function would introduce non-linearity to the model. The output of the convolutional encoder would be a fixed-size representation of the input data, which would then be fed into the recurrent decoder. The recurrent decoder would be responsible for generating the output sequence. It would consist of multiple layers of recurrent cells, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) or gated recurrent units (GRUs). These cells would have the ability to remember information from previous time steps, allowing the model to handle sequential data. The output of the recurrent decoder would be a sequence of hidden states, which would then be fed into the self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism would be responsible for capturing long-range dependencies in the input data. It would consist of multiple attention heads, each of which would attend to different parts of the input sequence. This would allow the model to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant information, leading to better performance. The output of the self-attention mechanism would be a weighted sum of the hidden states from the recurrent decoder, which would then be used to generate the final output sequence. One of the primary goals of this architecture is to minimize the number of parameters. This would be achieved by using shared weights in the convolutional encoder and the recurrent decoder. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism would also help reduce the number of parameters by attending to relevant parts of the input sequence. To maximize learning speed and accuracy, the model would use residual connections and layer normalization. Residual connections would allow the model to learn more complex representations by skipping over unnecessary layers, while layer normalization would help with faster convergence and better generalization. In conclusion, this hybrid architecture would combine the strengths of CNNs, RNNs, and self-attention mechanisms to handle variable input size, minimize the number of parameters, and maximize learning speed and accuracy. It would be a powerful and efficient replacement for the transformer model."},{"instruction":"give a detailed in-depth summary of the Youtube video titled \\" Lecture: Biblical Series XIV: Jacob: Wrestling with God \\"","output":"In the video titled \\"Lecture: Biblical Series XIV: Jacob: Wrestling with God,\\" the speaker discusses the story of Jacob from the Bible and how he wrestled with God.

During this journey, Jacob had a dream in which God spoke to him and promised to make him the father of a great nation. However, Jacob was hesitant to accept this promise, as he was afraid of Esau and did not believe that he was worthy of God's blessing. The speaker then discusses the story of Jacob wrestling with God, which took place at a river in the land of Peniel. In this story, Jacob was overcome by God and was forced to confront his own fears and doubts. Despite his initial reluctance, Jacob eventually accepted God's blessing and was renamed Israel, which means \\"struggler with God.\\" The speaker then discusses the significance of this story and how it teaches us about the nature of God and the human condition. The speaker notes that God is sovereign and powerful, but also that God is willing to work with us and help us overcome our fears and doubts. The speaker also notes that the story of Jacob wrestling with God is a reminder that we are all struggling with our own personal battles and that God is there to help us through them. Overall, the speaker provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the story of Jacob wrestling with God, drawing on the biblical text and offering practical insights for our own lives."},{"instruction":"give a detailed outline about the PARA method from NAME_1","output":"The PARA method is a framework for organizing your knowledge and tasks created by NAME_1.

Additionally, it is crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of both the stallion and the handler throughout the process. Here is a detailed walk-through on how to stimulate a stallion by hand to collect his semen: 1. Preparation:    - Ensure that the stallion is in good health and has been properly trained for semen collection.    - Gather all necessary equipment, including a clean and sterile artificial vagina (AV), a collection container, lubricant, and protective gloves.    - Choose a safe and controlled environment for the procedure, such as a breeding shed or a specially designed area. 2. Stallion Preparation:    - Lead the stallion into the designated area and secure him using appropriate restraints, such as a breeding mount or stocks.    - Clean the stallion's genital area thoroughly using warm water and mild soap, ensuring that all dirt and debris are removed.    - Dry the genital area completely using a clean towel or cloth. 3. Lubrication:    - Apply a generous amount of water-based lubricant to the AV, ensuring that it is evenly distributed along the inner surface.    - It is important to use a lubricant that is safe for equine use and does not contain any harmful substances. 4. Stimulation:    - Begin the stimulation process by gently massaging the stallion's penis using your hand covered with a protective glove.    - Use a firm but gentle grip, starting from the base of the penis and moving towards the glans.    - Apply consistent pressure and rhythm, mimicking the natural movements of a mare during mating.    - Observe the stallion's response and adjust the intensity and speed of the stimulation accordingly.    - Some stallions may require additional visual or auditory cues, such as the presence of a mare or the sound of a teaser stallion, to enhance their arousal. 5. Collection:    - Once the stallion reaches a state of full erection and shows signs of mounting behavior, carefully introduce the AV to the stallion's penis.    - Guide the penis into the AV, ensuring that it is inserted fully and securely.    - Maintain a steady grip on the AV while allowing the stallion to thrust naturally.    - Be prepared for the stallion's ejaculation, which typically occurs within a few minutes of mounting.    - Collect the ejaculate into the sterile collection container, taking care to avoid contamination. 6. Post-Collection:    - Remove the AV gently from the stallion's penis, ensuring that no semen is spilled.    - Inspect the collected semen for quality, volume, and motility.    - Properly label the collection container with relevant information, such as the stallion's name, date, and any additional details.    - Store the collected semen in a suitable container and transport it to a qualified equine reproductive facility for evaluation, processing, or immediate use. Remember, the process of stimulating a stallion by hand to collect semen requires expertise and should only be performed by trained professionals. It is crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of both the stallion and the handler throughout the procedure."},{"instruction":"Give a diet plan for 2500 calories with no seeds or nuts.","output":"Here's a diet plan for 2500 calories with no seeds or nuts: Breakfast: * 2 eggs (100 calories) * 2 slices of whole wheat bread (120 calories) * 1 medium banana (105 calories) * 1 cup of milk (100 calories) Total: 325 calories Snack: * 1 medium apple (95 calories) Total: 420 calories Lunch: * Grilled chicken breast (3 oz) (165 calories) * 1 cup of cooked brown rice (218 calories) * 1 cup of steamed broccoli (55 calories) Total: 438 calories Snack: * 1 medium orange (62 calories) Total: 492 calories Dinner: * Baked salmon (4 oz) (200 calories) * 1 cup of cooked quinoa (236 calories) * 1 cup of roasted sweet potatoes (225 calories) Total: 551 calories Dessert: * 1 small Greek yogurt (6 oz) (130 calories) * 1 medium pear (93 calories) Total: 223 calories Total: 2500 calories Note: This diet plan is high in protein and fiber, and includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Here are some tips to keep in mind when bleaching your hair: 1. Choose the right bleach: Look for a high-quality bleach powder and developer specifically made for hair. It's important to follow the instructions provided with the product. 2. Protect your hair: Bleaching can be damaging to your hair, so it's crucial to take steps to minimize damage. Deep condition your hair regularly before and after bleaching to keep it moisturized. Consider using a hair mask or oil treatment to nourish your hair. 3. Test strand: Before applying bleach to your entire head, do a strand test to see how your hair reacts to the bleach. This will help you determine the processing time needed and ensure you achieve the desired result. 4. Follow instructions: Read and follow the instructions provided with the bleach carefully. Mixing ratios and processing times can vary depending on the brand, so it's important to follow the guidelines to avoid damaging your hair. 5. Protect your skin: Apply a barrier cream or petroleum jelly along your hairline, ears, and neck to prevent the bleach from coming into contact with your skin. This will help minimize irritation and potential chemical burns. 6. Section your hair: Divide your hair into manageable sections before applying the bleach. This will ensure even application and help you avoid missing any spots. 7. Time it correctly: Keep a close eye on the processing time. Leaving the bleach on for too long can cause excessive damage to your hair, while not leaving it on long enough may result in uneven color. 8. Rinse thoroughly: Once the desired level of lightness is achieved, rinse your hair thoroughly with cool water to remove all traces of bleach. Follow up with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. 9. Conditioning treatment: After bleaching, your hair will need extra care. Use a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask regularly to restore moisture and prevent further damage. 10. Consider professional help: If you're unsure about bleaching your hair at home or have concerns about potential damage, it's best to consult a professional hairstylist who can guide you through the process and ensure the best results.

However, it's important to note that these patterns are not universal or inevitable, but rather are shaped by social, cultural, and political forces. In many societies throughout history, women have been viewed primarily in terms of their physical appearance and reproductive capabilities, a phenomenon known as objectification. This is often linked to patriarchal social structures, where power is concentrated in the hands of men. For example, in ancient Greece and Rome, women were often portrayed as objects of male desire in art and literature. In the Middle Ages, women's bodies were often used symbolically to represent concepts such as sin and temptation. The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about significant changes in gender roles. Women were increasingly confined to the domestic sphere, while men dominated the public sphere. This led to a further objectification of women, as their value was often tied to their ability to maintain a home and raise children. In the 20th century, the advent of mass media and advertising further perpetuated the objectification of women. Women's bodies were often used to sell products, reinforcing the idea that women are primarily valuable for their physical appearance. As for sexual submission, this too has a long history. In many societies, women were expected to be passive and submissive in sexual relationships. This was often tied to broader social expectations about women's roles and behavior. For example, in Victorian England, women were often portrayed as sexually passive and pure, while men were expected to be sexually aggressive. However, it's important to note that these patterns have been challenged and resisted throughout history. The women's rights movement in the 19th and 20th centuries fought for women's sexual liberation and challenged the objectification of women. Today, many people continue to challenge these harmful stereotypes and work towards a more equal and respectful understanding of gender and sexuality."},{"instruction":"give a history of the fall of the Tryllian civilization, who occupied the moon Titan until 898 b.c.e. when their civilization was destroyed","output":"I'm sorry for any confusion, but as far as our current knowledge and historical records go, there's no evidence or documentation of a civilization known as the Tryllians occupying Titan, one of Saturn's moons, in 898 BCE or at any other time.

However, in the multi-class setting considered in section 15.3.2, the neural network had as many outputs C as there was classes.

Think of the advantages of MC over dynamic programming and explain your choice.","output":"One example environment where MC method would be more suitable than dynamic programming in reinforcement learning is a game of blackjack. In this game, the agent's goal is to learn the optimal value function for each state in order to make the best decisions and maximize its rewards. The advantage of using MC method in this scenario is that it does not require a model of the environment, unlike dynamic programming which relies on a complete model of the environment. In blackjack, the agent does not have complete knowledge of the deck and the dealer's cards, making it difficult to create a model. MC method, on the other hand, learns directly from experience by simulating multiple episodes of the game and updating the value function based on the actual outcomes. Moreover, in dynamic programming, the value function is updated after every action, which can be computationally expensive in a game like blackjack where there are a large number of possible states. MC method, on the other hand, updates the value function after each episode, making it more efficient and scalable. In addition, MC method is more suitable for environments with stochastic rewards, such as blackjack, where the outcome of each action is not deterministic. Dynamic programming assumes deterministic rewards, which may not accurately reflect the real-world environment. Overall, in a game of blackjack, MC method would be a more practical and efficient approach to learning the value function compared to dynamic programming."},{"instruction":"Give an example in hardhat where I impersonate a wallet with hardhat and fork the bnb network","output":"Sure, I can guide you through the process of impersonating a wallet and forking the BNB network using Hardhat. Please note that you need to have Hardhat installed and set up on your machine. Here's a basic example: 1. **Install Hardhat and necessary plugins:**    If you haven't installed Hardhat yet, you can do so using npm:    \`\`\`    npm install --save-dev hardhat    \`\`\`    You'll also need the Hardhat network plugin for forking:    \`\`\`    npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai    \`\`\` 2. **Configure Hardhat:**    In your \`hardhat.config.js\` file, you'll need to specify the network you want to fork. In this case, it's the BNB network. You'll also need to provide a URL to an archive node. Here's an example:    \`\`\`javascript    module.exports = {      networks: {        hardhat: {          forking: {            url: \\"https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/\\", // BSC mainnet RPC          },        },      },      solidity: \\"0.8.4\\",    };    \`\`\`    Please note that you need to replace the URL with the actual RPC URL of the BNB network. 3. **Impersonate a wallet:**    In your Hardhat script or task, you can impersonate a wallet using the \`hardhat_impersonateAccount\` function.

A simple example of a first-order system is a mass-spring-damper system. Consider a mass m that is connected to a spring with a spring constant k, and a damper with a damping coefficient c. The motion of the mass can be described by the differential equation: m * d^2x/dt^2 + c * dx/dt + k * x = F Where x is the position of the mass, F is the force applied to the mass, and t is time. This differential equation can be rewritten in the form of a first-order system by introducing the velocity of the mass, v = dx/dt: m * dv/dt + c * v + k * x = F This equation describes how the velocity of the mass changes over time, and how the position of the mass changes as a result. The system has a natural frequency of oscillation given by: ω_n = sqrt(k/m) And a damping ratio given by: ζ = c/2m The behavior of the system can be described in terms of the initial conditions, the natural frequency, and the damping ratio. For example, if the initial velocity of the mass is zero, and the initial position is not at the equilibrium position, the mass will oscillate with a frequency given by ω_n, and the amplitude of the oscillations will decay exponentially with a time constant given by 1/ζ. This is just one example of a first-order system, but there are many other types of systems that can be described by first-order differential equations, such as electrical circuits, mechanical systems, and population dynamics."},{"instruction":"Give an example of an online course and explain why it is beneficial.","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Let's say you have a class called \`ShapeCreator\` that has methods for creating different types of shapes such as \`createCircle()\`, \`createRectangle()\`, and \`createTriangle()\`. Each of these methods creates an object of the corresponding shape type and returns it. Here's an example implementation of the \`ShapeCreator\` class: \`\`\` public class ShapeCreator {     public Shape createCircle(double radius) {         return new Circle(radius);     }     public Shape createRectangle(double width, double height) {         return new Rectangle(width, height);     }     public Shape createTriangle(double side1, double side2, double side3) {         return new Triangle(side1, side2, side3);     } } \`\`\` This implementation works well, but it can become unwieldy if you need to add more types of shapes in the future. With the factory method pattern, you can refactor the code to make it more flexible and maintainable. Here's an example refactored implementation using the factory method pattern: \`\`\` public abstract class Shape {     public abstract double getArea(); } public class Circle extends Shape {     private double radius;     public Circle(double radius) {         this.radius = radius;     }     @Override     public double getArea() {         return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);     } } public class Rectangle extends Shape {     private double width;     private double height;     public Rectangle(double width, double height) {         this.width = width;         this.height = height;     }     @Override     public double getArea() {         return width * height;     } } public class Triangle extends Shape {     private double side1;     private double side2;     private double side3;     public Triangle(double side1, double side2, double side3) {         this.side1 = side1;         this.side2 = side2;         this.side3 = side3;     }     @Override     public double getArea() {         double s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;         return Math.sqrt(s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3));     } } public class ShapeFactory {     public static Shape createShape(String shapeType, double... parameters) {         Shape shape = null;         switch (shapeType.toLowerCase()) {             case \\"circle\\":                 shape = new Circle(parameters[0]);                 break;             case \\"rectangle\\":                 shape = new Rectangle(parameters[0], parameters[1]);                 break;             case \\"triangle\\":                 shape = new Triangle(parameters[0], parameters[1], parameters[2]);                 break;             default:                 throw new IllegalArgumentException(\\"Unknown shape type: \\" + shapeType);         }         return shape;     } } \`\`\` In this refactored implementation, we've abstracted the shape interface and created separate classes for each type of shape that implement the interface. We've also created a \`ShapeFactory\` class that uses a switch statement to create objects of the appropriate shape type based on user input. This implementation is more flexible and maintainable because it allows you to easily add new types of shapes in the future without modifying the \`ShapeFactory\` class.

For instance, consider a company that operates a chain of retail stores. Management wants to gauge the efficiency of each store and identify potential areas for improvement. The company could develop an efficiency score based on metrics like sales per square foot, average transaction value, and inventory turnover rate. By analyzing these factors, the efficiency score offers a comprehensive view of each store's performance. Once the efficiency scores are calculated for all stores, the organization can: 1. Identify high-performing stores: Recognize the best practices and strategies employed by top-performers and share them with other stores to elevate company-wide performance. 2. Detect underperforming stores: Discover stores with lower efficiency scores that may require assistance to enhance their operations or implement new strategies to boost performance. This might involve staff training, optimal inventory management, or store layout modifications. 3. Establish benchmarks: Set efficiency standards and targets for each store, encouraging continuous improvement and friendly competition among the stores. 4. Allocate resources smarter: Allocate budget, personnel, and other resources more effectively, directing them towards areas where they're most needed and can generate the best results. 5. Monitor progress: Track efficiency scores over time to measure the impact of implemented changes and adjustments on store performance, promoting a culture of data-driven decision-making. In summary, an efficiency score can serve as a powerful tool for organizations, helping them optimize their operations, allocate resources intelligently, and measure the impact of changes, ultimately driving growth and fostering a results-oriented environment."},{"instruction":"Give an example of how a student enrolled nurse could put cultural awareness into practice. please provide referencing APA7th style","output":"A student enrolled nurse can put cultural awareness into practice in several ways.

The algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, calculating the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule. In the case of a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer: 1. Input layer: n units 2. Hidden layer: m units 3. Output layer: k units The number of edges in this network can be calculated as the product of the number of units in each connecting layer plus biases: - Edges between input and hidden layer: n * m - Edges between hidden and output layer: m * k - Biases for hidden layer: m - Biases for output layer: k Total number of edges = n * m + m * k + m + k Now, the backpropagation algorithm computes the gradients for each of these edges, so the complexity of backpropagation is linear in the number of edges. However, the number of units in the network is the sum of the units in each layer: Total number of units = n + m + k When analyzing the complexity of backpropagation concerning the number of units, we have to consider the worst-case scenario. In this case, the worst-case scenario would be when n, m, and k are of the same order, i.e., n ≈ m ≈ k ≈ N/3, where N is the total number of units in the network. In this case, the total number of edges becomes: Total number of edges ≈ (N/3) * (N/3) + (N/3) * (N/3) + (N/3) + (N/3) ≈ 2 * (N^2) / 9 + 2 * (N/3) As you can see, the complexity of backpropagation concerning the number of edges is linear (O(N)). However, when considering the number of units, the complexity becomes quadratic (O(N^2)) in the worst-case scenario."},{"instruction":"give an exhaustive list of all triples, from the following statement \\"My name is NAME_1.

Options: (A) Ram = Rs.1500, Shyam = Rs.1000, Mohan = Rs.750 (B) Ram = Rs.2500, Shyam = Rs.500, Mohan = Rs.250 (C) Ram = Rs.1200, Shyam = Rs.1300, Mohan = Rs.750 (D) Ram = Rs.3500, Shyam = Rs.500, Mohan = Rs.250 (E) None","output":"First, we should find a common denominator for the given ratios of 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4. The common denominator is 12. Multiplying each ratio by 12, we get the simplified ratios of 6:4:3 for Ram, Shyam, and Mohan, respectively. Next, we need to find the sum of these parts. 6 + 4 + 3 = 13. Now, we have to divide the total amount, which is Rs. 3250, by the sum of the parts (13). 3250/13 = Rs. 250. This is the value of each part. Finally, for each individual's share, multiply their respective ratio by the value of each part (Rs. 250): - Ram's share: 6 * Rs. 250 = Rs. 1500 - Shyam's share: 4 * Rs. 250 = Rs. 1000 - Mohan's share: 3 * Rs. 250 = Rs. 750 So the correct option is (A) Ram = Rs.1500, Shyam = Rs.1000, Mohan = Rs.750.

We have a train that is 60 meters long and it's moving at a speed of 36 kilometers per hour. The question is asking how long it will take for the entire train to pass a stationary telegraph post.  To solve this, we need to convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second because the length of the train is given in meters. We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters and 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds. So, 36 kilometers per hour is equal to 36 * 1000 / 3600 = 10 meters per second. Now, the time it takes for the train to pass the post is equal to the length of the train divided by its speed. So, 60 meters / 10 meters per second = 6 seconds.

The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental concept in modern physics that challenges our traditional understanding of space and time. In essence, the theory states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This idea revolutionized our understanding of space and time, and led to the development of two main theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, introduced in 1905, deals with objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. Einstein showed that time and space are not absolute, but are relative to the observer's frame of reference. The theory introduces the famous equation E=mc², which shows that mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other. General relativity, introduced in 1915, builds upon special relativity and introduces the concept of gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. According to this theory, the curvature of spacetime around a massive object such as the Earth causes objects to fall towards the center of the Earth, which we experience as gravity. In summary, the theory of relativity challenges our classical understanding of space and time by showing that they are relative and dependent on the observer's frame of reference. It has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and has led to many groundbreaking discoveries and technological advancements in fields such as astrophysics, particle physics, and engineering."},{"instruction":"Give a recipe for a buddha bowl dressing which is creamy with nutty tastes, hints of sour and sweet, and low in calories","output":"Sure, here's a recipe for a Creamy Almond-Tahini Dressing that should meet your requirements: Ingredients: - 1/4 cup almond butter - 2 tablespoons tahini - 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar - 1 tablespoon maple syrup - 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free) - 1/4 cup water (or more for desired consistency) - 1 clove garlic, minced - Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: 1.

The speaker argues that these cultures are deep-rooted, persistent, and different, and that there is no easy way to rank them as the best or worst. The solution, according to the speaker, is to engage in dialogue with people from different cultures to understand their perspectives. The speaker then goes on to discuss the political cultures of China, Russia, and the United States. They describe China as a centralized administrative state with a tradition of excellence, Russia as a culture of authority and tradition, and the United States as a semi-democratic society with a history of slavery and genocide. The speaker then raises the question of whether democracy is the wrong lens through which to view these countries. They argue that while democracy is important, it is not the only lens that should be used to understand political cultures and traditions. The real struggle of the world, according to the speaker, is to live together and overcome common crises such as environment and inequality."},{"instruction":"give a summary of the patient's medical history from this transcript: A: Can you tell me the doctors or other health care professionals you current see (like your GP) or have an upcoming appointment with?

It does this by combining two textures in a specific way. Here are the properties and how to use them: - \`_MainTex (\\"Texture\\", 2D) = \\"white\\" {}\`: This is the main texture of the object. You can replace \\"white\\" with the path to your desired texture file. - \`_Detail (\\"Detail\\", 2D) = \\"gray\\" {}\`: This is the detail texture that will be overlaid on the main texture. You can replace \\"gray\\" with the path to your desired detail texture file. In the \`surf\` function, the following happens: 1. The main texture is sampled at the UV coordinates of the current pixel (\`tex2D (_MainTex, IN.uv_MainTex).rgb\`). This gives us the color of the main texture at this point. 2. The screen position of the current pixel is converted to UV coordinates (\`IN.screenPos.xy / IN.screenPos.w\`). This is then scaled by a factor of 8 in the x direction and 6 in the y direction (\`screenUV *= float2(8,6)\`). 3. The detail texture is sampled at these UV coordinates (\`tex2D (_Detail, screenUV).rgb\`). This gives us the color of the detail texture at this point. 4. The color of the detail texture is doubled (\`* 2\`) and then multiplied with the color of the main texture (\`o.Albedo *= ...\`). This means the detail texture will modify the color of the main texture, making it darker or lighter depending on the color of the detail texture. In simpler terms, this shader takes two images (textures), one being the main image and the other being a detail image. It then overlays the detail image onto the main image, but it scales and positions the detail image based on the screen position of each pixel. This can create interesting visual effects, especially when the detail texture has a pattern or some transparency."},{"instruction":"Give a walkthrough on how to make grilled chicken kebabs.","output":"Sure!

They are used to explain what the code does, how it works, or why a particular approach was chosen. This can be incredibly helpful for others who are reading your code, or even for yourself if you come back to your code after a long time. Comments are not executed as part of the program, so they do not affect how your code runs. There are typically two types of comments: 1. **Single-line comments**: These are used for brief explanations or annotations. They only apply to the line they are on. 2. **Multi-line comments**: These are used when the comment text spans multiple lines. They start with a specific character or string and end with another. The syntax for comments varies between programming languages, but they are a feature in almost all languages. Here are a few examples: - In Python, single-line comments start with the hash character (\`#\`), and multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (\`\\"\\"\\"\` or \`'''\`). \`\`\`python # This is a single-line comment in Python \\"\\"\\" This is a multi-line comment in Python \\"\\"\\" \`\`\` - In JavaScript, single-line comments start with two forward slashes (\`//\`), and multi-line comments are enclosed between \`/*\` and \`*/\`. \`\`\`javascript // This is a single-line comment in JavaScript /* This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript */ \`\`\` - In Java, single-line comments also start with two forward slashes (\`//\`), and multi-line comments are enclosed between \`/*\` and \`*/\`. There's also a special kind of multi-line comment starting with \`/**\` and ending with \`*/\`, used for creating documentation. \`\`\`java // This is a single-line comment in Java /* This is a multi-line comment in Java */ /**  * This is a Javadoc comment in Java  */ \`\`\` Remember, while comments are important, good code should be as self-explanatory as possible. Comments should complement the code, not serve as a crutch for understanding it."},{"instruction":"give detailed information about  Input and Output  in programming and is it available among various programming languages?","output":"Input and output are fundamental concepts in programming. Input refers to the data or values that are entered by the user into a program, while output refers to the results or information that the program produces based on the input. Input and output can be handled in various ways depending on the programming language being used. Here are some examples of how input and output are handled in some popular programming languages: 1. Python: In Python, input() is a built-in function that prompts the user to enter a value and returns it as a string. Output can be achieved using the print() function, which prints the value to the console. 2. Java: In Java, input can be handled using the Scanner class, which allows the user to enter values through the console. Output can be achieved using the System.out.println() method, which prints the value to the console. 3. C++: In C++, input and output can be handled using the cin and cout statements, respectively. The cin statement reads input from the user, while the cout statement prints output to the console. 4. JavaScript: In JavaScript, input can be handled using the prompt() function, which prompts the user to enter a value and returns it as a string. Output can be achieved using the console.log() method, which prints the value to the console. All programming languages have similar mechanisms for handling input and output, although the specific syntax and functions used may vary depending on the language."},{"instruction":"give detailed information about Modules and libraries in programming and is it available among various programming languages?","output":"Modules and libraries are collections of pre-written code that can be reused in a program. They allow programmers to save time and effort by providing pre-built functionality that can be easily integrated into their own code. Modules and libraries are generally organized into a tree-like structure, with higher-level modules and libraries providing more general functionality, and lower-level modules and libraries providing more specific functionality. This hierarchy allows programmers to mix and match different modules and libraries to create custom solutions for their specific needs. In programming, modules and libraries are available in most programming languages, including: * C and C++: The standard libraries in C and C++ provide a wide range of functionality, including string handling, data structures, and input/output operations.

Triumphal Entry: Palm Sunday commemorates Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which is documented in all four Gospels (Matthew 21:1-11, Mark 11:1-11, Luke 19:28-44, and John 12:12-19). As Jesus rode into the city on a donkey, crowds greeted him by laying down palm branches and their cloaks in his path, celebrating him as the prophesied Messiah. 2. Prophecy Fulfillment: Jesus riding a donkey into Jerusalem fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy from Zechariah 9:9, which says, \\"Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\\" This signified that Jesus was entering the city as a symbol of peace, rather than a war-waging king. 3. \\"Hosanna\\": During Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, the people shouted \\"Hosanna!\\" which means \\"Save us now!\\" or \\"Save, we pray!\\" (Matthew 21:9, Mark 11:9-10, Luke 19:38, and John 12:13). They recognized Jesus as the promised Savior, and their shouts of praise were a fulfillment of Psalm 118:25-26: \\"Lord, save us! Lord, grant us success! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\\" 4. Prelude to Jesus' Crucifixion: Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week, the time leading up to Jesus' crucifixion and subsequent resurrection. The same crowds that hailed Jesus as a king on Palm Sunday would soon call for his crucifixion (Matthew 27:22-23, Mark 15:12-14, Luke 23:20-21, and John 19:14-15). This highlights the fickleness of human nature and the contrast between Jesus' divine kingship and the people's expectations of an earthly ruler. 5. Palm Sunday in Protestant Worship: In many Protestant churches, Palm Sunday is observed with special worship services that include the distribution of palm branches and the reading of the biblical accounts of Jesus' triumphal entry. Some churches may also hold processions, reenacting Jesus' journey into Jerusalem. This serves as a reminder of Jesus' sacrificial love and the beginning of Holy Week, leading up to Good Friday and Easter."},{"instruction":"Give four futuristic robotics applications ideas that are not yet been invented and highly needed in all industries in the world, such that can be build by python 3, Robot Operating System, UR5e.

In 1921, the Nebraska Legislature passed the Public Meetings Act, which required all meetings of public bodies to be open to the public. However, this law had several loopholes and was not strictly enforced, leading to continued concerns about closed-door meetings and lack of transparency in government decision-making. In the 1960s, the Nebraska Press Association and other groups began advocating for a stronger open meetings law. In 1975, the Nebraska Legislature responded by passing the Open Meetings Act, which replaced the Public Meetings Act. This new law required all meetings of public bodies to be open to the public, with a few exceptions for certain sensitive topics such as personnel matters and legal discussions. The Open Meetings Act also established penalties for public bodies that violated the law, including fines and potential removal from office for elected officials. This helped to increase accountability and discourage closed-door meetings. In the following decades, there were several amendments made to the Open Meetings Act to further strengthen its provisions. In 1982, the law was amended to require public bodies to provide notice of their meetings to the public and the media at least 24 hours in advance. This allowed for greater public participation and awareness of government meetings. In 1994, the law was amended again to require public bodies to keep minutes of their meetings and make them available to the public upon request. This ensured that there was a record of what was discussed and decided in these meetings, promoting transparency and accountability. In 2007, the Open Meetings Act was amended to include electronic meetings, allowing for public bodies to hold meetings via teleconference or video conference. This was a response to the increasing use of technology in government and allowed for greater accessibility for those unable to attend in person. In recent years, there have been ongoing efforts to further strengthen the Open Meetings Act. In 2014, the law was amended to require public bodies to provide a detailed agenda for their meetings, including specific topics to be discussed. This helped to ensure that the public was aware of what would be discussed in these meetings and could better prepare to participate. In 2018, the Open Meetings Act was amended again to require public bodies to provide a public comment period at their meetings. This allowed for greater public input and participation in government decision-making. Today, the Open Meetings Act remains an important tool for promoting transparency and accountability in Nebraska's government. It ensures that the public has access to information about how their government operates and makes decisions. It also allows for greater public participation and input in these processes. However, there have been some challenges and controversies surrounding the Open Meetings Act. Some public bodies have been accused of violating the law by holding closed-door meetings or not providing proper notice to the public. In response, there have been calls for stricter enforcement and penalties for those who violate the law. In conclusion, the history of Nebraska's Open Meetings Act reflects a continuous effort to promote transparency and accountability in government. From its early beginnings in the 1920s to the present day, the law has undergone several amendments to strengthen its provisions and ensure that the public has access to information about their government. While there have been challenges and controversies, the Open Meetings Act remains an important tool for promoting good governance in Nebraska."},{"instruction":"Give me 100 lichess.org username ideas that are short and concise, like this one: evz04 (this is just for inspiration) Here are my other usernames that I have on other social media accounts for inspiration: Real Name: Vincent Tran Discord: Indifference Instagram: victor_taimanov","output":"1.

Because 7 8 9\\" might be considered funny: 1. Wordplay: This joke is a classic example of a pun, which is a form of wordplay that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. In this case, \\"7 8 9\\" sounds like \\"seven ate nine\\" when spoken aloud, creating a playful twist. 2. Unexpectedness: The punchline is unexpected. When asked why one number would be scared of another, we don't typically anticipate the answer to involve one number \\"eating\\" another.

I don't know any japanese.","output":"Challenge 1: Karaoke Marathon Japan is famous for its karaoke bars, and they're a great place to work on social anxiety because they're designed for fun and relaxation. Here's your challenge: 1. Find a popular karaoke bar in the city you're visiting. It's better if it's a place where people can rent individual rooms, but they also share a common area for everyone who wants to sing in front of strangers. 2. Start by renting a room for yourself. Spend some time getting comfortable with the equipment and singing on your own. This will help you get used to the environment without the pressure of an audience. 3. Once you're comfortable, move to the common area. Choose a song that you love and know well. Remember, the goal isn't to be the best singer, but to enjoy the experience and connect with others. 4. After your performance, try to engage with the audience. Compliment others on their performances, ask about their song choices, or simply share your experience of singing in front of others.  Challenge 2: Night Market Food Adventure Night markets are a big part of Japanese culture, and they're a great place to try new things and meet new people. Here's your challenge: 1. Find a bustling night market in the city you're visiting. These markets are usually filled with a variety of food stalls, each offering different types of Japanese cuisine. 2. Your goal is to try something new from at least five different stalls. But here's the twist: instead of choosing what to eat yourself, ask the person in line behind you to choose for you. This will not only give you the opportunity to try something you might not have picked yourself, but it will also give you a chance to interact with locals. 3. After you've tried the food, strike up a conversation with the person who chose it for you. Ask them why they chose that particular dish, if it's their favorite, or how often they come to the night market.  Remember, the goal of these challenges is not to overcome your social anxiety in one night, but to take small steps towards becoming more comfortable in social situations. Take your time, be patient with yourself, and most importantly, enjoy the experience."},{"instruction":"Give me 30 adjectives for use in a NAME_1 name generator.","output":"Sure, here are 30 adjectives that could be used in a name generator: 1.

This can lead to a security vulnerability known as command injection, where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system. 2. **Insecure Data Storage**: Storing sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or personal user information in plain text or in insecure locations can lead to data breaches. It's important to always encrypt sensitive data and use secure methods for storage. 3. **Improper Error Handling**: Revealing too much information in error messages can expose details about your code structure, database schema, or other backend information that could be useful to an attacker. It's important to handle errors properly and avoid revealing sensitive information. Remember, it's crucial to always follow best practices for secure coding to minimize the risk of these and other security vulnerabilities."},{"instruction":"give me 3 proposed heading titles for this paragraph: CRT informs the understanding of antiracist math pedagogy in secondary classrooms by recognizing that racism is embedded in the education system and that it affects students' experiences in the classroom. Teachers who use CRT to frame antiracist math pedagogy are able to understand that racism is not just an individual problem but a structural one, and they work towards addressing these structures to create a more equitable math classroom. (Ladson-Billings, 2021)  The movement that has dominated the maths equity debate has revolved around making traditional courses more accessible for black and brown students. ((Equity and Mathematics: An Interview with Deborah Ball and Bob Moses, n.d.) However what remains important to consider is if the traditional offerings in schools are most conducive to learning and what do they represent. Are we aspiring all students to take Algebra or are we able to consider pathways that offer varied understandings of maths? How are we considering what is accepted high-level academic achievement?

Here are three Python exercises suitable for an 11-year-old to build their programming skills: 1. Guess the Number: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The program should then prompt the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is too high, the program should print \\"Too high!\\" If the guess is too low, the program should print \\"Too low!\\" If the guess is correct, the program should print \\"Congratulations, you guessed the number!\\" 2. Mad Libs Game: Create a program that asks the user to enter different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) and then uses those words to fill in the blanks of a story template. For example, the program could ask for a noun, verb, and adjective, and then print out a sentence like \\"The [adjective] [noun] [verb] over the [noun].\\" 3. Hangman Game: Implement a simple version of the Hangman game. The program should choose a random word from a predefined list and display it as a series of underscores. The user should then be able to guess letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, the program should reveal the corresponding underscores. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the program should keep track of the incorrect guesses and display a hangman figure. The game should continue until the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts. These exercises will help the 11-year-old practice basic programming concepts like random number generation, user input, conditional statements, and string manipulation."},{"instruction":"Give me 3 quick ways to make money online with digital marketing","output":"Sure, here are three ways you can make money online with digital marketing: 1. **Affiliate Marketing**: This involves promoting other people's (or company's) products and earning a commission for each sale that you make.

Here are 5 steps for creating a Python application to calculate Root Mean Square (RMS), NAME_1, and Crest Factor in an audio file: 1. Import necessary libraries: You'll need to import libraries that provide functionality for reading and manipulating audio files in Python. The two most commonly used libraries are \`pyaudio\` and \`numpy\`. You can install these libraries using pip by running \`pip install pyaudio numpy\`. 2. Open the audio file: You'll need to open the audio file using the \`pyaudio\` library. You can do this by creating a \`PyAudio\` object and specifying the file name as the input. 3. Read the audio data: Once you have opened the audio file, you can read the audio data using the \`read\` method of the \`PyAudio\` object. This will return an array of audio samples. 4. Calculate RMS value: To calculate the RMS value, you'll need to sum up the squares of all the audio samples and divide by the number of samples. You can do this using \`numpy\` library. 5. Calculate NAME_1 and Crest Factor: To calculate the NAME_1 and Crest Factor, you'll need to find the maximum and minimum values of the audio signal. Once you have these values, you can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values, and then divide the difference by the RMS value. Here is a sample code that demonstrates these steps: \`\`\`python import pyaudio import numpy as np def calculate_audio_metrics(file_path):     # Open the audio file     p = pyaudio.PyAudio()     stream = p.open(file_path, format=pyaudio.paFloat32, channels=1)          # Read the audio data     data = stream.read()     data = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.float32)          # Calculate RMS value     rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(data**2))          # Calculate NAME_1 and Crest Factor     NAME_1 = np.abs(data).max()     crest = np.abs(data).min()     pcf = (NAME_1 - crest) / rms          return rms, NAME_1,"},{"instruction":"Give me 5 summer vacation destinations in Europe","output":"Sure!

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standard language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases. It is used to extract, modify, and analyze data in a structured and organized way. Here are some of the key concepts and examples of how SQL is used: 1. Connecting to a database: Before you can use SQL to interact with a database, you need to establish a connection to it. This can be done using a variety of tools and methods, depending on the type of database you are using. For example, if you are using MySQL, you can use the MySQL command-line client or a graphical user interface (GUI) tool like phpMyAdmin to connect to the database. 2. Creating tables: Once you are connected to a database, you can use SQL to create tables to store data. A table is a collection of rows and columns that represent a set of related data. For example, you might create a table to store information about customers, with columns for name, address, phone number, and email address. 3. Inserting data: After you have created a table, you can use SQL to insert data into it. This is done using the INSERT INTO statement, followed by the name of the table and the data you want to insert. For example, you might insert a new customer into the customers table by running the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql INSERT INTO customers (name, address, phone, email) VALUES ('John Doe', '123 Main St', '555-555-5555', 'john.doe@example.com'); \`\`\` 1. Retrieving data: Once you have data stored in a table, you can use SQL to retrieve it. This is done using the SELECT statement, followed by the name of the table and the columns you want to retrieve. For example, you might retrieve all the names and addresses of customers in the customers table by running the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT name, address FROM customers; \`\`\` 1. Updating data: You can also use SQL to update data in a table. This is done using the UPDATE statement, followed by the name of the table, the set of data you want to update, and the condition that specifies which rows to update. For example, you might update the phone number of a customer in the customers table by running the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql UPDATE customers  SET phone = '555-555-5556'  WHERE name = 'John Doe'; \`\`\` 1. Deleting data: Finally, you can use SQL to delete data from a table. This is done using the DELETE statement, followed by the name of the table and the condition that specifies which rows to delete. For example, you might delete all customers in the customers table whose email address is not in the format \\"john.doe@example.com\\" by running the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql DELETE FROM customers  WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@example.com'; \`\`\` These are just a few of the basic concepts and examples of how SQL is used. There are many other features and capabilities of SQL, depending on the type of database you are using and the specific use case you are working with."},{"instruction":"Give me a 15 min podcast outline aboıut \\"The secrets behind the Mona Lisa painting\\"","output":"Sure, here is a possible outline for a 15-minute podcast about the secrets behind the Mona Lisa painting: I.

This emerging technology harnesses the unique behavior of quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent not only the traditional binary states of 0 or 1 but also a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This feature allows quantum computers to handle massive amounts of data and solve problems that are currently impossible or intractable on classical computers. Quantum mechanics, the foundation of quantum computing, is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy on the tiniest scales – at the level of atoms and subatomic particles. It reveals the counterintuitive and mysterious nature of our universe, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously and become entangled with one another, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. When particles are entangled, the state of one particle is directly related to the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This intrinsic connection is what enables quantum computers to perform computations much faster and with exponentially less energy than their classical counterparts. The core component of a quantum computer is the qubit, which is analogous to the classical bit but with additional quantum properties. Qubits can be physically realized using various technologies, such as trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and quantum dots. A quantum computer comprises a large number of interconnected qubits that can be manipulated through quantum gates, which control the flow of quantum information. The power of a quantum computer lies in its ability to perform multiple computations simultaneously, thanks to the phenomena of superposition and entanglement. As a result, the processing capacity of a quantum computer grows exponentially with the number of qubits, making it ideal for solving complex optimization problems, simulating quantum systems, and breaking cryptographic codes. Quantum algorithms, the set of instructions that can be executed on a quantum computer, exploit the peculiarities of quantum mechanics to surpass the performance of classical algorithms in specific tasks. Some of the breakthrough quantum algorithms include Shor’s algorithm, which can factor large numbers much faster than the best-known classical algorithms, and Grover’s algorithm, which can search an unsorted database quadratically faster than classical search algorithms. These developments have sparked interest in a wide range of fields such as cryptography, chemistry, finance, and artificial intelligence. There are several challenges associated with building practical quantum computers, including error correction and decoherence. Decoherence refers to the loss of quantum information due to the interaction of qubits with their surrounding environment. This makes quantum computers inherently error-prone, which is a major obstacle in scaling the technology. Quantum error correction is a set of techniques designed to protect quantum information and maintain the integrity of computations in the presence of errors. Researchers are actively working to develop fault-tolerant quantum computers that can execute large-scale computations reliably. Despite these challenges, progress in quantum computing has been accelerating rapidly, with industry leaders such as IBM, Google, and Intel investing heavily in the technology. Researchers are continuously developing new techniques and algorithms to harness the power of quantum computing. As quantum computers become more robust and accessible, they have the potential to revolutionize multiple industries by solving previously unsolvable problems, discovering new materials and drugs, optimizing complex systems, and significantly accelerating machine learning capabilities. In summary, quantum computing is a cutting-edge technology that leverages the peculiar principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex computations much faster than classical computing allows. With enormous potential in a wide range of applications, quantum computing promises to spark a new wave of technological innovation and transform the way we solve the most pressing challenges of the 21st century."},{"instruction":"give me a 500 word summary of what the kodratiev wave is","output":"The Kondratiev wave, also known as the Kondratieff cycle or long wave, is a theory proposed by Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev in the 1920s. It suggests that capitalist economies go through long-term cycles of economic growth and decline, lasting approximately 50 to 60 years. According to Kondratiev, these cycles consist of four distinct phases: expansion, stagnation, recession, and recovery. During the expansion phase, the economy experiences rapid growth, characterized by technological advancements, increased investment, and rising living standards. This phase is often fueled by major innovations and new industries. After the expansion phase, the economy enters a period of stagnation, where growth slows down and productivity gains become more difficult to achieve. This phase is marked by overcapacity, declining profits, and a lack of significant technological breakthroughs. Stagnation can last for several years, as the economy struggles to find new sources of growth. The stagnation phase eventually leads to a recession, where the economy experiences a significant downturn. This can be triggered by various factors, such as financial crises, overinvestment, or geopolitical events. During a recession, businesses face declining sales, rising unemployment, and reduced consumer spending. This phase is often characterized by economic contraction and a decline in overall economic activity. However, after the recession, the economy enters a phase of recovery. This phase is marked by the implementation of new technologies, increased investment, and the emergence of new industries. As the economy rebounds, productivity and living standards start to improve, leading to a new period of expansion. Kondratiev argued that these long waves are driven by technological innovations and the diffusion of new technologies throughout the economy. He identified several historical examples of long waves, such as the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent periods of economic growth in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the Kondratiev wave theory has been subject to criticism and debate, it remains influential in understanding long-term economic cycles. Some economists argue that these waves can help explain the rise and fall of industries, the impact of technological change, and the dynamics of economic growth. In conclusion, the Kondratiev wave theory proposes that capitalist economies go through long-term cycles of economic growth and decline, lasting approximately 50 to 60 years. These cycles consist of four phases: expansion, stagnation, recession, and recovery. Technological innovations play a crucial role in driving these waves, as they lead to periods of rapid growth and subsequent periods of slower growth and decline. While the theory has its critics, it provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of long-term economic cycles."},{"instruction":"Give me a 5-day itinerary of madrid and total cost for 2 people","output":"Sure!

Here's what the code for \`Home.vue\` might look like: \`\`\`php <template>   <div>     <h1>Home</h1>     <ul>       <li v-for=\\"post in posts\\" :key=\\"post.id\\">{{ post.title }}</li>     </ul>   </div> </template> <script> export default {   data() {     return {       posts: [         { id: 1, title: 'Post 1' },         { id: 2, title: 'Post 2' },         { id: 3, title: 'Post 3' }       ]     }   } } <\/script> \`\`\` In this code, we're using a \`v-for\` directive to iterate over an array of posts and display each one as a list item. Now, let's tell Nuxt.js to render this page when someone visits the \`/home\` route. To do this, we'll create a new file called \`pages/home.js\` in the \`pages\` directory of our project. Here's what the code for \`pages/home.js\` might look like: \`\`\`javascript import Home from '../components/Home.vue' export default {   name: 'Home',   component: Home } \`\`\` In this code, we're importing the \`Home\` component and telling Nuxt.js to render it when someone visits the \`/home\` route. Finally, let's add a route to our \`pages/index.js\` file to tell Nuxt.js where to render our \`Home\` page. Here's what the code for \`pages/index.js\` might look like: \`\`\`javascript import Vue from 'vue' import Router from 'vue-router' import Home from '../components/Home.vue' Vue.use(Router) const routes = [   { path: '/', component: Home },   { path: '/about', component: () => import('../components/About.vue') } ] export default new Router({ routes }) \`\`\` In this code, we're using the \`Vue\` and \`Router\` modules to create a new \`Router\` instance. We're also defining two routes: the root route (\`/\`) will render our \`Home\` page, and the \`/about\` route will render a new page called \`About\`. That's it! With these changes, when someone visits \`http://localhost:8080/\`, they should see the \`Home\` page with a list of posts."},{"instruction":"give me a beginner pytorch tutorial","output":"Sure, here is a beginner pytorch tutorial for you: 1. Install PyTorch: The first step is to install PyTorch on your computer. You can do this by following the instructions on the official PyTorch website. 2. Understand the basics: Before diving into coding, it is important to understand the basics of PyTorch. This includes understanding tensors, data types, and operations. 3. Import PyTorch: Once PyTorch is installed, you can import it into your Python code using the following command: import torch 4. Create a tensor: Tensors are the basic data structure in PyTorch. You can create a tensor using the torch.tensor() function. For example: x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]) 5. Perform operations on tensors: You can perform various operations on tensors such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example: y = x + 2 6. Build a simple neural network: PyTorch is commonly used for building neural networks. You can build a simple neural network using the torch.nn module. Here is an example of a simple neural network with one hidden layer: import torch.nn as nn class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):     def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):         super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()         self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)         self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)     def forward(self, x):         x = self.layer1(x)         x = nn.ReLU(x)         x = self.layer2(x)         return x 7. Train the neural network: Once you have built your neural network, you can train it using the torch.optim module. This module provides various optimization algorithms such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop. Here is an example of training a neural network using the SGD optimizer: model = NeuralNetwork(10, 20, 2) optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) for epoch in range(100):     optimizer.zero_grad()     output = model(input)     loss = loss_function(output, target)     loss.backward()     optimizer.step() 8. Test the model: After training the model, you can test it on a new set of data to see how well it performs. Here is an example of testing the model: test_output = model(test_input) _, predicted = torch.max(test_output.data, 1) accuracy = (predicted == test_target).sum().item() / len(test_target) 9. Further learning: PyTorch has many advanced features and capabilities that you can explore to improve your skills. Some recommended resources for further learning include the official PyTorch documentation, online tutorials, and courses. I hope this tutorial helps you get started with PyTorch. Happy coding!"},{"instruction":"GIve me a blog on Osint","output":"Sure!

Featuring artists Yinka Shonibare MBE, Cindy Sherman, and Paul McCarthy.","output":"Artists Yinka Shonibare MBE, Cindy Sherman, and Paul McCarthy are renowned for their ingenuity in capturing the spirit of contemporary society through satire and reinvention of iconic figures from literature, art history, and popular culture.  Yinka Shonibare MBE, a British-Nigerian artist, is celebrated for his thoughtful installations, sculptures, and paintings that explore the complexities of post-colonialism, race, and cultural identity. Often incorporating \\"Dutch Wax\\" fabric into his work, Shonibare challenges Western stereotypes and showcases the interwoven nature of global histories.  Cindy Sherman, an American artist, is a master of self-transformation, using photography as her primary medium to create thought-provoking images. By assuming various personas and employing props, costumes, and makeup, Sherman satirizes societal expectations and stereotypes, particularly surrounding women and their representation in the media. Paul McCarthy, also an American, is known for his provocative works spanning performance, sculpture, and multimedia. His art frequently explores the dark underbelly of pop culture, examining themes like consumerism, power dynamics, and the perversion of popular icons. McCarthy's unsettling, humorous, and satirical commentary invites viewers to reconsider societal norms, exposing contradictions we often overlook. Together, these artists brilliantly capture the sensibilities of our age, reflecting on the complexities of modern society and offering insightful critique through their satirical and inventive approaches."},{"instruction":"Give me a brief explanation of how a stenographer's keyboard works.","output":"A stenographer's keyboard, also known as a stenotype machine, works quite differently from a standard QWERTY keyboard. Instead of typing out each individual letter of a word, stenographers use a method called chorded typing, where they press multiple keys at the same time to create whole syllables, words, or phrases. The stenotype machine has fewer keys, typically around 22, and they are arranged in a unique layout. The keyboard is split into two halves. The left side is used for initial consonants, the right side for final consonants, and the middle (the vowel keys) for vowels. When a stenographer presses keys simultaneously, the machine records these strokes in the order they were pressed. The stenographer combines these strokes to form words or phrases. For example, to write the word \\"cat\\", a stenographer might press the keys for \\"K\\", \\"A\\", and \\"T\\" simultaneously. The shorthand language used on these machines is called stenography, which is a phonetic language. This means that words are written as they sound, not as they are spelled in English. This allows stenographers to type at very high speeds, often over 200 words per minute, which is essential for tasks like court reporting. It's important to note that learning to use a stenotype machine requires extensive training and practice, as it's not only about learning the keyboard layout, but also mastering the shorthand language and the skill of chorded typing."},{"instruction":"give me a brief history of berlin","output":"Berlin has a rich and complex history that spans more than 800 years.

If you are looking to appeal an NCAT decision, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. Although you have the right to appeal most decisions in most courts and tribunals, not all decisions handed down by the NCAT are appealable. This article will set out: what decisions are appealable the appeals process; and the alternatives to an appeal. What Decisions are Appealable? The Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (‘the Act’) allows you to appeal or seek permission to appeal to an NCAT Appeal Panel from decisions made in the following divisions: administrative and equal opportunity; guardianship; occupational (but only those relating to occupations licensed by state law and regulated by state authorities such as builders, mechanics and real estate agents); and consumer and commercial. It may also be possible to appeal decisions of a registrar that are declared to be appealable decisions. What Decisions Are Not Appealable? You cannot appeal an NCAT decision made in the following divisions: administrative and equal opportunity (but only those relating to certain legislation such as anti-discrimination, child protection or native title); and occupational (but only those relating to certain professions such as medical, health and legal). You also cannot appeal an NCAT decision made in the following proceedings where: NCAT has imposed a civil penalty (usually a fine); it is an external appeal; or the internal Appeal Panel has made the decision. Where it is not possible to appeal a decision, it may be possible to appeal to the: Supreme Court; Land and Environment Court; or Court of Appeal. What Are the Different Types of Decisions? NCAT can make three different kinds of decisions. These decisions are either: final (which determine the outcome of the proceedings); ancillary (which is preliminary to a final decision); and interlocutory (which is concerned with adjourning (pausing) a hearing, issuing a summons or summary dismissal of proceedings). A summons is a type of order which directs a party to appear before a judge or magistrate. Summary dismissals are decisions which will ‘throw out’ a claim for being either: vexatious (a claim made solely to harass the opposing party) frivolous (a claim that has little chance of being won); an abuse of process; or unable to be brought because there is no reasonable claim at law. When Do You Have the Right to Appeal an NCAT Decision and When Do You Need Permission? Your rights to appeal a decision depend on whether the decision is final, ancillary or interlocutory. For example, you will have the right to appeal against a final or ancillary decision when you are appealing on a question of law. That is when there is a dispute as to the interpretation of the law. However, you will always require permission when appealing an interlocutory decision. What Will NCAT Consider When Deciding to Grant Permission? When deciding whether to grant permission to appeal, the Appeal Panel will consider whether the: matter involves issues of: clear injustice; principle; or questions of public importance; cost to the parties and NCAT; and appeal is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the subject matter of the proceedings. The NCAT will determine whether permission is granted to appeal an interlocutory decision: at the final oral hearing of the appeal; at the oral hearing before the final hearing; or on the basis of the written submissions without an oral hearing. What Is the Process if You Want to Appeal an NCAT Decision? If you are able to appeal an NCAT decision, the process for you to appeal a decision usually involves the following steps: complete a Notice of Appeal form; lodge the Notice of Appeal within 28 days; pay the prescribed fee or complete a fee waiver request form; give the sealed Notice of Appeal to the party you are suing; receive a Reply to Appeal from your opponent within 14 days; receive Notice of Directions Hearing or “call over” within 28 days. A directions hearing is a brief hearing in front of the judge. The judge is able to discuss the progress of the appeal with both parties and give both parties instructions; comply with any directions made at the directions hearing for filing and delivery of submissions; the directions hearing will either order another directions hearing, alternative dispute resolution or an Appeal Panel hearing; the file will be closed if it is resolved or, if not resolved, set down for an Appeal Panel hearing; attend the hearing; and receive a decision. What Are the Alternatives to an Appeal? An appeal may not always be possible or even appropriate where there is a difficulty or problem with an NCAT decision. As an alternative to an appeal, a party may ask the tribunal to do the following: set aside the decision (but only where all parties agree or where the NCAT has made a decision without one of the parties); set aside the proceeding or decision (but only where there has been a failure to comply with the law or procedural rules); or correct an error in a decision or the reasons for a decision. For example, typographical errors or inconsistency between the orders and the reasons for the decision. Key Takeaways Unlike most courts and tribunals, not all NCAT decisions are appealable. Depending on the type of decision, you may or may not be able to appeal. If you are unable to appeal, you should explore whether you may be able to appeal to the Supreme Court, Land Environment Court or Court of Appeal. In addition, you may have to seek permission from NCAT to appeal.","output":"A homeowner in New South Wales has recently had a dispute with a builder or real estate agent that was taken to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT).

A variation to the scope of works (i.e. plans and/or specifications) can take place either at the request of the owner or builder. Once a request for a variation has been made the builder needs to follow up with a written variation notice. All variation requests must be signed and dated by an owner and builder prior to the works being undertaken.  A variation notice should include the following information:  Detail of the work(s) to be carried out or excluded from the contract, including any additional costs and credits due to the owner  The period of time claimed for the additional works to be carried out – for example, 10 days  Reason/s for the variation (required only if the variation has been requested by the builder).  Variation forms are available to purchase from the HIA bookshop or your local stationary supplier. The forms are called ‘Variation document‘.  The relevant clauses in the HIA Contracts for claiming a variation are as follows:  Clause 23 – New Homes Contract (January 2020 version)  Clause 26 – Alterations, Additions and Renovations (January 2020 version).  What if the owner doesn’t agree to the variation? If an owner refuses to sign a variation then the builder is not obliged to carry out the variation works, and can refuse to do so.  The only times builders may do extra works without the owner signing the variation are in the following circumstances: Where the works and/or materials are designated in the contract as a prime cost item or a provisional sum item (and this work is not a variation). Where the owner asks for a variation in writing and the builder reasonably believes that the variation will not require a variation to the building permit, will not cause any delay and will not add more than 2% to the original contract price. Where a builder is required out of circumstances beyond the builder’s control to carry out a variation by a building surveyor or other authorised person under the Building Act and the owner does not dispute the notice within five business days. What if the builder carries out work without a signed variation? Where a builder has failed to obtain a signed variation a builder risks not being paid for the work. Builders should naturally avoid being in such a situation. To seek to enforce unsigned variations you may have to make a claim at VCAT.  There are limited situations in which you may get paid for unsigned variations including: if there are exceptional circumstances, or the builder would suffer significant or exceptional hardship and it would not be unfair to the building owner, there is a valid excuse why the paperwork was not done at the time and there is irrefutable evidence that the owner knew of the exact work to be done and agreed to payment of the approximate amount payable for this work.

It originated from the Bauhaus School, founded by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar, Germany. The school's main principle was to merge art and craft, emphasizing the unity of form and function. Bauhaus architecture incorporated geometric shapes, clean lines, and an absence of unnecessary ornamentation. The style favored open floor plans, flat roofs, and large windows, to allow for natural light and provide a connection between the interior and exterior spaces. Bauhaus architects often used modern construction materials, such as steel, concrete, and glass, allowing for new possibilities in structural design. The focus was on affordability and creating practical living spaces that were both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Influential architects of the Bauhaus movement include Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Le Corbusier. Although the school was short-lived, closing in 1933 due to political pressure, the Bauhaus style has had a significant impact on architecture and design worldwide and is often associated with modernism."},{"instruction":"Give me a bucket list of 30 things that lovers can do in each season: spring, NAME_1, fall, and winter.

To control the speed of a 6V motor, you will need a circuit that provides a variable voltage or current to the motor. Here is a simple circuit that you can use to control the speed of a 6V motor: Circuit Description: * The circuit consists of a voltage controller (such as a potentiometer or a variable resistor) connected in series with the motor. * The voltage controller is used to adjust the voltage applied to the motor, which in turn controls the speed of the motor. * The circuit also includes a diode (such as a 1N4001) to protect the motor from reverse voltage. How it Works: * When the potentiometer is turned clockwise, the voltage applied to the motor increases, causing the motor to speed up. * When the potentiometer is turned counterclockwise, the voltage applied to the motor decreases, causing the motor to slow down. Components Needed: * 6V motor * Potentiometer (or variable resistor) * Diode (such as 1N4001) * Breadboard or PCB * Jumper wires Conclusion: This circuit is a simple way to control the speed of a 6V motor using a potentiometer or variable resistor. By adjusting the voltage applied to the motor, you can control its speed. Be sure to use a diode to protect the motor from reverse voltage.

In Florida","output":"Medical billing services are a critical component of the healthcare industry. They ensure that healthcare providers, including doctors, are reimbursed for the services they provide to patients. Here's a comprehensive understanding of medical billing services that you can discuss with the doctor: 1. **Efficiency**: Medical billing services streamline the billing process. They use advanced software to automate the process, reducing the time spent on manual data entry. This allows the doctor to focus more on patient care rather than administrative tasks. 2. **Accuracy**: These services ensure accurate billing by verifying insurance eligibility, coding services correctly, and submitting claims promptly. This reduces the chances of claim denials and rejections, ensuring that the doctor gets paid for all the services provided. 3. **Compliance**: Medical billing companies stay updated with the latest changes in billing regulations, coding standards, and insurance policies. This ensures that the billing process is always compliant with the current rules and regulations, reducing the risk of audits and penalties. 4. **Revenue Optimization**: Medical billing services can help optimize revenue by identifying underpayments, managing denied claims, and providing detailed reports on revenue trends. This can help the doctor understand their revenue cycle better and make informed decisions to increase profitability. 5. **Patient Satisfaction**: By handling billing inquiries and disputes, medical billing services can improve patient satisfaction. They can provide clear, detailed bills to patients and answer any questions they may have, improving the overall patient experience. In Florida, these benefits can be particularly advantageous due to the state's large and diverse population. The state has a high percentage of elderly residents who often require more medical services, and therefore, more complex billing. Additionally, Florida has strict regulations regarding medical billing, making the compliance assistance provided by a medical billing service even more valuable. Your company can provide these benefits to the doctor, helping them to streamline their billing process, increase revenue, and improve patient satisfaction. By doing so, you can help them focus more on what they do best - providing quality healthcare services to their patients."},{"instruction":"give me a concise history of the earth.","output":"Of course! Here is a brief history of the Earth: The Earth is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years old, with the earliest known evidence of life dating back to around 3.5 billion years ago. Here is a brief overview of the major events in the Earth's history: 1. Formation of the Earth: The Earth is believed to have formed around 4.5 billion years ago from the accretion of dust and gas in the solar nebula. 2. Early Earth: The early Earth was a hostile place, with temperatures reaching as high as 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius). It is thought that the atmosphere was composed of methane, ammonia, and water vapor. 3. Formation of the Moon: Around 4.5 billion years ago, a massive object collided with the early Earth, leading to the formation of the Moon. This event is believed to have caused the Earth's rotation to slow down, resulting in longer days. 4. Oceans Form: Around 4 billion years ago, the Earth's atmosphere began to cool, and the oceans began to form. The oceans are thought to have originated from the evaporation of water from the early Earth's surface. 5. Life Emerges: Around 3.5 billion years ago, the first life forms emerged on Earth. These early organisms were likely single-celled and simple in structure. Over time, these organisms evolved and became more complex. 6. Cambrian Explosion: Around 540 million years ago, there was a rapid increase in the diversity of life on Earth, known as the Cambrian Explosion. This period saw the emergence of many complex organisms, including animals with complex body structures. 7. Plate Tectonics: Around 3 billion years ago, the Earth's crust began to break apart and move, leading to the formation of the first continents. This process, known as plate tectonics, continues to shape the Earth's surface today. 8. Ice Ages: Around 2.5 billion years ago, the Earth experienced its first ice age. During this period, large parts of the Earth were covered in ice, and the climate was much colder than it is today. 9. Human Era: The most recent period in the Earth's history is the human era, which began around 200,000 years ago. During this time, humans have had a significant impact on the Earth's environment, leading to changes in the climate, the loss of biodiversity, and the degradation of ecosystems. Of course, this is just a brief overview of the Earth's history, and there is much more to learn about the planet's past. But I hope this gives you a good starting point for your studies!"},{"instruction":"give me a concise pacific coast highway itinerary.

However, it's important to note that CNNs are typically used for image data, which is inherently 2D (height and width) or 3D (height, width, and channels). If you have 1D vector data, you might want to consider other types of neural networks, such as a fully connected network or a recurrent neural network. That being said, if you still want to use a CNN for 1D data, you can do so. Here's a simple example using Keras: \`\`\`python from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense, Conv1D, Flatten # Assuming your input vectors have a length of 128 input_shape = (128, 1) model = Sequential() model.add(Conv1D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape)) model.add(Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')) model.add(Flatten()) model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')) model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) \`\`\` In this model, \`num_classes\` is the number of classes you want to classify your data into. You would replace it with the actual number of classes in your dataset. Remember to reshape your input data to match the input shape of the model. For example, if you have a dataset \`X\` of shape \`(num_samples, 128)\`, you would need to reshape it to \`(num_samples, 128, 1)\` before feeding it to the model. Please note that this is a very basic model and might not give the best results. You might need to adjust the architecture and hyperparameters based on your specific task and dataset."},{"instruction":"give me a cpp code to create a API REST example","output":"Sure, here is a simple example of a REST API using the Crow library in C++.
