Liang, a German citizen, has worked for VW since 1983, first in Germany and then in the US, according to WDIV. He allegedly led the team of engineers that developed a defeat device for the company's diesel vehicles. That device allowed VW vehicles to pass emissions tests while emitting nitrogen oxide at rates 40 times what is allowed by the EPA when actually on the road. Authorities say the defeat device was developed by Liang and his team in 2006 in Germany and that Liang was testing the device in California in 2014 and 2015. Liang faces up to five years in prison and a 250,000 fine, CNBC reports. As part of his plea agreement, Liang will be cooperating with investigators, something that could reduce his sentence.

In September, Johan Ernst van NassauSiegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 .

Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.

Upon being diagnosed with acid reflux, your doctor may prescribe a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It's important to follow the prescribed course of medication strictly, as skipping doses or stopping medication prematurely can lead to more severe symptoms. PPIs work by blocking acid production in the stomach, thus relieving symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. It's also essential to take PPIs as instructed to have the intended effect of the medication. Antacids, on the other hand, work by neutralizing stomach acid already present in the system, and can provide immediate but short-lived relief. It's worth noting that PPIs and antacids should not be taken together, as they can negate the effects of each other. Therefore, it's crucial to follow doctor-prescribed treatment and avoid self-medication or changing medication without consulting your doctor. A healthier lifestyle, including weight control, regular exercise, and a balanced diet, can also help reduce acid reflux symptoms.

Proper storage of garlic is crucial to keep it fresh and delicious for as long as possible. One way to store garlic is to braid the bulbs together and hang them up in a dry, cool and well-ventilated space. You can use a clothing line or a hook in your kitchen to hang the garlic for 6-12 months. This method of storage not only keeps the bulbs fresh but also serves as a great kitchen decoration. If you prefer to store stemless bulbs, make sure to keep them at room temperature for 4-6 months. You want to ensure that they are in a cool, dry place with good ventilation to avoid moisture build-up, which can cause the garlic to spoil. It is also important to inspect the bulbs regularly and remove any that show signs of rotting or mold. If you have sliced garlic, it's best to store it in an airtight container in your refrigerator. This will prevent the garlic from absorbing other odors in the fridge and keep it fresh for 2-3 months. Make sure to keep the container away from any moisture, as it can cause the garlic to spoil faster. In conclusion, storing garlic properly can extend its shelf life and keep it fresh and flavorful for longer. Whether you prefer to braid the bulbs or store stemless bulbs and sliced garlic, be sure to keep them in the right temperature and moisture conditions, and inspect them regularly for any signs of spoilage.

McAlpine claimed he only intended to scare pub patrons, but his actions resulted in a horrific act of violence. The incident took place outside The Blue Bell pub in Northumberland. McAlpine had been causing a disturbance inside the establishment, and when he was asked to leave, he became angry and got into his vehicle. He then plowed into Canavan, who was standing outside the pub at the time. The victim was thrown several yards and suffered serious injuries. Following the attack, McAlpine drove off without stopping to help Canavan, who was left lying in the street. The police managed to trace the vehicle involved in the incident and arrested McAlpine shortly afterward. At trial, McAlpine described how he had consumed a large amount of alcohol and was acting on a dare from his friends. He claimed he never intended to hurt anyone and only wanted to \\"scare\\" the pub patrons. However, his actions have had severe consequences, with Canavan fighting for his life in hospital for weeks after the attack. The judge presiding over the trial was unimpressed with McAlpine's explanations and ruled that his actions were reckless and dangerous. The accused was sentenced to two years in jail and will also face an extended period of disqualification from driving. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of using vehicles as weapons. Even a moment of recklessness or a desire to cause fear can have severe and irreversible consequences.

According to reports, O'Reilly stated that the restaurant, Sylvia's, was \\"exactly the same\\" as those in white neighborhoods. Many were quick to criticize the commentator, accusing him of making racially charged remarks. However, O'Reilly has since come forward and stated that his comments were taken out of context and distorted. In fact, he claims that he was actually trying to make a point about the positive experiences he had while dining at Sylvia's. O'Reilly visited the restaurant with prominent civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been quick to defend the host in the wake of the controversy. Sharpton has stated that during their visit to Sylvia's, O'Reilly \\"said nothing at dinner ... that was offensive to me.\\" He has argued that the media has taken O'Reilly's comments and twisted them to fit a certain narrative. Sharpton has also called on the public to take a step back and view the situation with an objective eye, rather than simply jumping to conclusions. Despite Sharpton's support for O'Reilly, many others in the media and beyond have been quick to attack the Fox News host for his remarks.

There are numerous ways to promote diversity without making students categorize themselves. One option is to focus on creating safe and inclusive spaces for all students, regardless of their backgrounds, where they feel welcome, heard and appreciated. Another option is to organize events and activities that celebrate different cultures and traditions, such as food festivals or cultural performances.

Calculate total interest using loan payments.","output":"When it comes to buying a home, one of the most significant considerations is the mortgage. Mortgages can be a complicated subject, but thankfully, online mortgage loan calculators can help make things easier. By using an online mortgage loan calculator, you can determine your monthly payment amount, interest rate, and even the total interest you will pay over the life of the loan. The first step in using an online mortgage loan calculator is to gather your financial information. This includes your income, expenses, and down payment amount. Once you have this information, you can input it into the calculator to determine how much house you can afford. The calculator will also take into account your credit score and current interest rates to provide you with an estimated mortgage payment. But, the most important feature of these calculators is the ability to calculate your total interest payment. By inputting your loan payment amount, loan term, and interest rate, the calculator can determine the total amount of interest you will pay over the life of the loan. This is important because it can help you make informed decisions about your mortgage. For example, if you lower the interest rate or increase your monthly payment amount, you can significantly reduce the total amount of interest you will pay. By using an online mortgage loan calculator to experiment with different payment scenarios, you can determine the best plan for you financially. Ultimately, an online mortgage loan calculator is a powerful tool that can help you navigate through the home buying process. By taking advantage of this technology, you can ensure that you are making informed decisions about your mortgage and that you are comfortable with the payments and interest rates that come with it. So, next time you are in the market for a new home, consider using an online mortgage loan calculator to help make the process easier and more manageable."},{"instruction":"w might one describe the sentiment of this review?

In the interview, he revealed that he was trained as a spy and that calling him a contractor is a bid \\"to distract from the totality of my experience.\\" Snowden's decision to leak classified information to the media not only landed him in hot water with the U.S. government but also sparked a global debate about privacy and the role of government in our lives. For many, he is a hero who exposed the illegal and unethical practices of the government. For others, he is a traitor who put national security at risk. Regardless of how one feels about his actions, it's clear that Snowden is a highly skilled and experienced individual when it comes to intelligence gathering. His work for the CIA, NSA, and Defense Intelligence Agency involved collecting and analyzing data to help inform national security decisions. But Snowden's decision to leak classified information to the media was a direct result of his concerns about the scope and legality of government surveillance programs. He believed that the American people had a right to know about the extent of government surveillance and the potential violations of privacy that were occurring. As a result of his actions, Snowden has been living in Russia to avoid prosecution in the United States on espionage charges. While some have criticized him for seeking asylum in Russia, he has defended his decision by saying that he had no other options available to him. In the end, Snowden's revelations have led to significant changes in government policy and public perception of privacy and surveillance.

However, there are different types of outlines to choose from, and it's important to select one that best fits the project's needs. Two common types of outlines are topic outlines and sentence outlines. Topic outlines use keywords and phrases to create a broad overview of the main ideas in your paper. On the other hand, sentence outlines use complete sentences to provide more detail and structure to your ideas. Choosing between the two types of outlines largely depends on the nature of the paper you are writing. Topic outlines are more suitable for shorter assignments or when you need to quickly jot down ideas in a web diagram. They can be useful when you are still in the brainstorming phase and want to record all of the ideas that come to mind. However, if you need to provide more detail or finer points, the sentence outline is the better option. Sentence outlines provide a more detailed organizational structure for your paper. Each bullet point is a complete sentence that states the main point, and the sub-points provide the supporting evidence or arguments. This type of outline is often useful in research papers or longer essays where detailed information is needed. Regardless of which outline type you choose, it's important to keep capitalization issues in mind. Stick to a consistent format throughout the outline, whether it be heading capitals or lowercase letters. Additionally, while it's important to provide detail in a sentence outline, keep in mind that the purpose of an outline is to condense your ideas into a concise format. Be mindful of length, and don't overload your outline with unnecessary information. In conclusion, choosing between a topic outline and sentence outline depends on the project's needs, length, and detail requirements.

The proposal has been met with mixed reviews, with some arguing that it is a necessary step to ensure that all officers can fulfill their duties effectively. In addition to the criticism of the fitness tests, senior officers have also slammed the potential appointment of Mr. Winsor as the Chief Inspector of Constabulary. This move has also proven controversial, with some questioning whether Mr. Winsor has the necessary qualifications and experience to take on such a role. The debate surrounding the role of police officers and the level of fitness required to perform their jobs effectively is one that has been ongoing for many years. Critics argue that the police force is too often \\"out of shape\\" and unable to perform to the best of their abilities, while supporters of the force argue that this is an unfair characterization of the dedication and skill of officers. Ultimately, the question of whether fitness tests should be made compulsory for police officers and whether Tom Winsor is the right person for the role of Chief Inspector of Constabulary is one that will continue to be debated. However, it is clear that the police force plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and well-being of all members of society, and that the dedication and commitment of officers should not be dismissed or overlooked."},{"instruction":"Consider this sentence: I saw Jim yelling at some guy in a military uniform with a huge red beard.

The movie is a unique combination of several genres: It's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this! This movie definitely makes it to my top 5, and should be enjoyable to every movie lover. The action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying, but the way it's shot differs from the style of Hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense (ghosts can fly) See this movie, you won't regret it. 10/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?

The device, codenamed Myst, is expected to be announced later this week at Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters. Speculation surrounding the social media giant's rumored mobile phone project has been rife for years, but recent leaks and rumors have given weight to the possibility of an imminent launch. The Myst handset is believed to be Facebook's first foray into the smartphone market, following the unsuccessful launch of its ill-fated Facebook Home software in 2013. Not much is known about the new device at this stage, but reports suggest that it will feature deep integration with Facebook services and apps, including a new Facebook Home-style launcher. This could mean that users will have instant access to their Facebook newsfeed, messages, and notifications directly from their lockscreen. However, it is unclear whether this partnership with HTC will be enough to succeed where Facebook Home failed. The previous software launch was widely criticized for being too invasive, with many users complaining about the way it took over their lockscreen and made it difficult to access other apps. Facebook has struggled to make a significant impact in the crowded smartphone market in the past, but the company is clearly determined to carve out a space for itself in the mobile world.

The usual design is that the camera's parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying the sensor's signal gain in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm. A few camera designs also provide EI adjustment through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB; this variation allows different tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced into the shadow areas of the photo.

The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation.

Firstly, try pinching below the zipper and use your other hand to gently pull the zipper down. If this doesn't work, pinch above the zipper and again, use your other hand to pull the zipper up. Be patient and try not to force the zipper, as this could damage it. Next, check for anything that may be obstructing the zipper's path.

If the teeth of the zipper appear damaged or misaligned, gently run your fingers along them to try and realign them. If this doesn't work, it may be time to replace the zipper entirely. Replacing a zipper may sound daunting, but with a few simple tools and some patience, it can be a fairly straightforward process. Start by removing the old zipper, then measure and cut the new zipper to fit. Using a needle and thread or a sewing machine, carefully sew the new zipper into place.

The robotic craft has been circling around the ringed planet for the past two decades, collecting invaluable information and taking stunning pictures of the gas giant. Recently, experts have claimed that a new image of Saturn must be \\"one of the greats\\" of the entire Cassini mission. This is no small feat considering the countless images and data that have been collected over the past 20 years. The image in question was compiled by a Croatian computer programmer who created a mosaic from colour filter images taken by Cassini. The stunning picture shows the swirling clouds and intricate rings of Saturn in vivid detail. This new image comes as Cassini is nearing the end of its mission. The spacecraft is set to crash into Saturn's atmosphere in September 2017, signaling the end of its successful mission. For scientists and space enthusiasts alike, the Cassini mission has been a source of fascination and wonder. The images and data collected from the spacecraft have deepened our understanding of Saturn and its many moons, and will continue to be studied for years to come.

The Swiss ace was defeated in the semifinals by Albert Montanes in straight sets with a score of 6-2, 7-6(7-5). Despite this setback, Federer seems unfazed, declaring that he is not worried. Federer is known for his consistent and impressive performances on the tennis court. He has won a total of 20 Grand Slam titles, making him one of the greatest players of all time. However, his recent loss to Montanes at the Estoril Open may indicate that his form is not at its peak. Montanes, on the other hand, has had a relatively unremarkable career compared to Federer, with only six ATP titles to his name. Nevertheless, he managed to outplay the world number one with his powerful shots and precision serves. Despite this loss, Federer remains confident in his ability to defend his French Open title. He has won the French Open a total of 3 times and is determined to add another title to his name. This self-assurance is a testament to Federer's unwavering determination and competitiveness on the court. In the lead up to the French Open, Federer will be looking to regroup and analyse his performance. He will need to work on his weaknesses and improve his overall game in order to come out on top at the tournament. However, with his admirable track record and resilience, it would be unwise to count him out just yet. In conclusion, Federer's defeat to Montanes at the Estoril Open may have come as a surprise, but it certainly won't dampen his spirits. With the French Open looming on the horizon, Federer will be gearing up to give his best shot and achieve his ultimate goal of adding another Grand Slam title to his incredible career."},{"instruction":"Data: Antioch, California, isPartOf, California; California, language, Chinese language Sentence about the following d","output":"Antioch, California is part of California, which has the Chinese language."},{"instruction":"Write the answer: What band did Zack de la Rocha and Tom Morello play in?","output":"Rage Against the Machine."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics. But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.

Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence.

Asymmetric federalism exists where states are granted different powers, or some possess greater autonomy than others do.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. In the English language, the works of Shakespeare have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism—both because the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation, and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile. The principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity, the Bible, and Shakespeare, have been applied to many works, extending backwards from the present to the earliest known written documents, in Mesopotamia and Egypt—a period of about five millennia. However, the application of textual criticism to nonreligious works does not antedate the invention of printing.

The prolonged and gradual process of the Islamization of Iran began following the conquest. Under the new Arab elite of the Rashidun and later the Umayyad caliphates, both converted (mawali) and nonconverted (dhimmi) Iranians were discriminated against, being excluded from the government and military, and having to pay a special tax called Jizya.

But it also proves troublesome for immigration advocates since the U.S. is dealing with an influx of illegal migrants. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"President Barack Obama, who had pledged in June to act on immigration reform before the end of the summer, has decided to postpone any action until after the midterm elections in November. The move comes as a relief to Democrats running in highly-contested races, but is a blow to immigration advocates who argue that the U.S. is currently dealing with an influx of illegal migrants. Obama had originally indicated that he would take executive action to reform the country’s immigration system in the face of Congressional inaction. However, recent polling has indicated that some Democrats, particularly those running for re-election in conservative states, were concerned about the issue and were urging Obama to delay any action. The immigration question has become a high-profile issue in many states, spurring voter interest and shaping the electoral landscape. Many Democrats are running in districts with large Hispanic populations and have been pushing for immigration reform, while Republicans have taken a harder line on the issue, criticizing Obama for failing to enforce existing laws and securing the border. For immigration advocates, Obama’s decision to postpone action is seen as a missed opportunity to address a problem that they argue is a crisis. The U.S. has been facing a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border, and advocates have been calling on Congress and the White House to take action to address the situation. While Obama has not yet spelled out what he intends to do after the midterm elections, speculation has been rampant that he will implement some form of executive order to address immigration reform. However, that approach could create more political problems for Democrats and lead to increased opposition from Republicans. The immigration question has become one of the most contentious issues in the U.S. political arena, with activists on both sides of the issue pressuring politicians to act. The decision by Obama to delay action is sure to reignite the debate and possibly increase the stakes for Democrats in the midterm elections."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Just had the best day ever!

The move comes at a time when social media, particularly micro-blogging sites like Twitter, have played a significant role in co-ordinating protests and uprisings in the Arab world. Despite concerns that Alwaleed may attempt to influence or control user-generated content on the site, analysts predict that this will not be the case. In fact, many believe that Alwaleed's investment is simply a shrewd business move, aimed at diversifying his portfolio and tapping into the growing popularity of social media. It is clear, however, that the power of Twitter and other social media sites to mobilize and connect people is not lost on Alwaleed. As a businessman with extensive holdings and interests in the Middle East, he will no doubt be closely observing the ways in which Twitter and other social media platforms continue to shape the political and social landscape of the region. Ultimately, the acquisition of a strategic stake in a micro-blogging site by a powerful and influential individual like Alwaleed raises important questions about the role of social media in shaping our world.

However, there are some things you can do to make it easier for both parties involved. One important rule is to avoid asking someone out in front of other people. This can make the person feel uncomfortable or put them on the spot, causing them to give an answer they don't really mean. Another tip is to suggest something you know the person will find interesting. This will show that you have taken an interest in their tastes and preferences, making the person more likely to consider going out with you. If you know the person enjoys a specific activity or sport, suggest doing that together rather than a generic dinner and movie date. Being gracious is also essential. If the person declines your invitation, don't take it personally or try to convince them otherwise. Respect their decision and move on. Being gracious will leave a positive impression on the person, making them more comfortable around you in the future. Finally, consider asking the person if they want to study together. This will provide a casual and low-pressure environment for the two of you to get to know each other better. Plus, who doesn't want a study buddy? In summary, asking someone out doesn't have to be stressful or awkward. By avoiding public settings, suggesting interesting activities, being gracious, and considering a casual environment like studying, you can increase your chances of a successful outcome."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: paul hackett was fired as southern california 's coach monday after three seasons of mediocrity at a school that has won eight national championships .","output":"Paul Hackett, former coach of Southern California, was fired due to three seasons of mediocre performance despite the university's eight national championships."},{"instruction":"ere is an email: GT, I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.

The former NFL running back achieved this incredible feat on December 17, 2006, during a game between the San Diego Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The game was being played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, and Tomlinson was in top form that day. The touchdown came in the second quarter of the game, with the Chargers already leading 7-0. Tomlinson took a handoff from his quarterback, Philip Rivers, and found a gap in the Chiefs' defense. He then accelerated downfield, leaving Kansas City's defenders in his wake. By the time he crossed the goal line, he had covered 91 yards in total, making it the longest scoring run of his illustrious career. Tomlinson was widely regarded as one of the best running backs of his era. He spent the majority of his career with the San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers), but also played for the New York Jets. He retired from the NFL in 2012, having amassed over 13,600 rushing yards and 145 rushing touchdowns. Tomlinson's 91-yard touchdown run is just one example of the incredible athleticism and skill that he brought to the game of football.

Fortunately, most courses provide a scorecard that outlines important details about the holes and their respective difficulty levels. One of the first things to look for on a scorecard is the \\"hole\\" column, which will typically list the holes from 1 to 18. This will help you keep track of where you are on the course and what's coming up next. Next, it's important to identify the front and back 9 sections of the course. Typically, the front 9 will be the first 9 holes played, while the back 9 will be the final 9 holes. This split course into 2 halves, and knowing which holes make up each half can help you develop a game plan. The scorecard will also typically list the color names on the side, which indicate each hole's distance. This can help you determine what clubs to use and how to approach each hole. A crucial piece of information listed on the scorecard is the handicap section. This section ranks the holes by difficulty, with the most challenging hole receiving the highest handicap number. This information can help you prioritize which holes to focus on during your practice sessions and develop a strategic game plan. Finally, be sure to spot the par information, which states how many shots you should take to complete each hole. This information will help you keep track of your score throughout the round and adjust your strategy as needed. In conclusion, while it's easy to overlook the importance of a scorecard, it can actually be one of the most valuable tools in your golf bag. By taking the time to study the layout of each hole and their respective difficulty rankings, you can develop a strategic game plan that gives you the best chance of success on the course."},{"instruction":"Saturday 10 February 2018 61822586 requests since Tuesday 16 December 2003 Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Saturday 10 February 2018: 61,822,586 requests since Tuesday 16 December 2003."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Browns Cambridge, eatType = restaurant, customer rating = 1 out of 5.

Making a meal plan is essential to ensuring that you are getting the proper nutrients your body needs. Start by considering the types of foods that you want to eat and then build a plan around them. This will help you to avoid unhealthy foods that contain empty calories. Empty calories come from foods that are high in sugar, salt or fat, but provide little to no nutritional value. These calories can add up quickly and lead to weight gain and other health problems. Avoiding these types of foods and instead choosing whole, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can help to keep you full and satisfied while also providing you with the vitamins and minerals that your body needs. Drinking plenty of water is another key component of a healthy diet. Water is essential for your body's functioning, including the transportation of nutrients and removal of waste. Try to aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day to stay hydrated and promote good health. Taking a whole foods multivitamin can also be beneficial in ensuring that you are getting all the necessary vitamins and minerals that may be missing from your diet. However, it's important to note that supplements should never replace whole, natural foods. Rather, they should complement a healthy balanced diet. Overall, making a conscious effort to plan your meals, cut out empty calories, drink plenty of water, and take a whole foods multivitamin can help to support your body's health and promote optimal wellness."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to prune an elm tree Prune only during the early spring to prevent elm bark beetles.

With the addition of Pearl Ex pigment powder, you can add shimmer and shine to your designs. Here's how to create beautiful embossed effects using Pearl Ex and embossing powder. Materials: - Pearl Ex pigment powder - Clear embossing powder - Heat gun - Stamp - Versamark ink pad - Cardstock paper - Paintbrush Instructions: 1. Choose a stamp that you would like to emboss onto your paper. Make sure the stamp is clean and free of any debris. 2. Ink the stamp with Versamark ink and stamp it onto the cardstock paper. 3. Mix a small amount of Pearl Ex pigment powder with clear embossing powder. A good rule of thumb is to use a ratio of 2 parts embossing powder to 1 part Pearl Ex. Mix the two powders together using a paintbrush. 4. Sprinkle the tinted powder mixture over the stamped image. Be sure to cover the entire stamped area. 5. Tap off any excess powder and return it to the container. 6. Use a heat gun to melt the embossing powder. Hold the heat gun about 6 inches away from the paper and move it around in circular motions. The powder mixture will start to melt and become shiny. 7. Continue to heat the powder mixture until it is completely melted and smooth. 8. Let the embossed image cool for a few seconds and then use a soft cloth or tissue to wipe away any excess Pearl Ex pigment powder. Tips: - Experiment with different ratios of embossing powder to Pearl Ex for varying levels of shimmer and shine. - Use a small paintbrush to apply the powder mixture to small, intricate stamps. - Make sure your heat gun is pointed away from your face and any flammable objects. - Practice on a scrap piece of paper before embossing your final project. In conclusion, adding Pearl Ex pigment powder to your embossing powder is an easy way to create stunning, shiny effects on your paper projects.

With the rise of social media and the internet, we are more connected than ever before, but it’s easy to forget that there are real people behind the screens. Before you click that “send” or “post” button, take a moment to consider the impact of your words. In today’s digital age, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that what we say online can have a profound effect on the people we communicate with. Being polite online isn’t just about being nice, it’s about being respectful of others. Remember that there are real people behind the usernames and profile pictures, and they have feelings, too. The words we use have the power to hurt, but they also have the power to uplift and inspire. It’s important to recognize that online interactions can have real-world consequences. Something that may seem harmless or innocuous to us could be deeply hurtful to someone else. Always be mindful of how your words can affect others, and strive to treat others how you would want to be treated. In addition to being polite, it’s important to think before you click. With the speed at which we can communicate online, it can be easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment and say something we later regret. Before you hit the “send” or “post” button, take a step back and consider whether what you’re about to say is necessary or helpful. Taking the time to think before you click can prevent misunderstandings and hurt feelings. If you’re unsure about how your words may be received, try putting yourself in the other person’s shoes. Ask yourself how you would feel if someone said the same thing to you. In conclusion, always think before you click, and always be polite. Our words have the power to connect us or to drive us apart, and it’s up to us to choose how we use that power. By being mindful of our online interactions and treating others with respect and kindness, we can help create a more positive and connected online community."},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: The company impresses the Street with strong earnings, an optimistic outlook, and a toehold abroad.

However, the traditional family household with a married couple and one or more children under the age of 18 is still the most common household in the US. Based on the latest statistics from the US Census Bureau, married-couple families with children under 18 accounted for 20.9% of all households in 2019. This percentage has slightly declined from previous years due to the rise of non-traditional families such as unmarried couples with children, single-parent households, and living alone individuals. The percentage of households with married couples and no children under 18 is also significant, accounting for 28.9% of all households in 2019. This suggests that while families with children are still prevalent, there is a growing trend of couples without children. Non-family households, where individuals live alone or with non-relatives, account for 28.4% of all households in the US. This reflects the increasing number of people who choose to live alone, either for personal or economic reasons. In terms of income, statistics show that households with a higher income are more likely to be married-couple families. Meanwhile, low-income households are more likely to be either single individuals, single-parent households or cohabiting couples. In conclusion, while there are several types of households in the US, the traditional family household with a married couple and children under 18 remains the most common. However, non-traditional family structures are on the rise, and non-family households are becoming more common as well."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},H={key:1};function F(o,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",R,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
