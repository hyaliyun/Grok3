If you need to make a frame, the first step is to cut lumber to the desired size. Make sure to measure accurately and have a sturdy saw to make clean cuts. Once you have your pieces cut, it's time to assemble the frame. One of the most common ways to do this is by nailing the boards together. You can use a hammer and nails or a nail gun for a more efficient assembly. Make sure to use the appropriate size nails and space them evenly along the boards to provide stability. After the frame is complete, the next step is covering the front. A great option for this is using lauan plywood. This type of plywood is thin and lightweight, making it easy to work with. It has a smooth surface that's perfect for painting, and it can be found in either 1/4-inch (6mm) or 1/8-inch (3mm) thicknesses. Cut the lauan to fit the front of the frame, making sure to leave a slight overhang on all sides. Attach it to the frame using either nails or glue, depending on your preference. If you plan to paint the frame, make sure to sand and prime the lauan first to ensure the paint adheres properly.

He was diagnosed with transverse myelitis inflammation of the spinal cord for which there is no cure. Around 70% of sufferers will never. recover but Mr Wardman is determined to walk again with the help of intensive physiotherapy. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Chris Wardman, a 41-year-old referee, was struck with crippling chest pains while refereeing a football match. He lost control of his legs and was later diagnosed with transverse myelitis, a condition that inflames the spinal cord and has no cure. Transverse myelitis affects around 1,400 people each year in the United States, and 70% of them never fully recover. However, Wardman remains determined to walk again and is undergoing intensive physiotherapy sessions to improve his chances. Transverse myelitis occurs when inflammation damages the spinal cord's nerves, disrupting signals sent by the brain and causing various symptoms such as muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling sensations. The exact causes of the condition remain unknown, but it can occur in association with infections, autoimmune diseases, or after vaccination. In Wardman's case, he has been fighting the condition for months, facing challenges in mobility and daily activities. Yet, the dedicated referee continues to work hard during his physiotherapy sessions to help regain his ability to walk. While there is no guaranteed cure for transverse myelitis, steps can be taken to ease the symptoms and improve mobility odds. Physiotherapy, medication, and supportive devices are often used to help patients recover functionally. Wardman's condition serves as a reminder of the importance of acknowledging sudden pain regardless of how small they may seem. It also highlights the value of determination and hard work, as Wardman remains confident and motivated to walk again someday."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Continue practicing until your dog learns how to lie down at your command.","output":"Teaching your dog basic obedience commands is essential to having a happy and healthy relationship with your furry friend. One such command is the 'down' command, which is a precursor to teaching your dog more advanced tricks like playing dead. Before you can teach your dog to play dead, it's essential to ensure that he has mastered the 'down' command. The first step to teaching your dog the 'down' command is to choose a comfortable area to train him. This area should be free from any distractions like loud noises or other pets. A distraction-free environment will help your dog focus on learning the command. Once you have found a comfortable area, you can then start training your dog. Begin by commanding your dog to sit. It's essential to start with the 'sit' command as it makes it easier for your dog to transition into the 'down' command. Stand directly in front of your dog while he is seated, and with a firm, but gentle voice, command him to lie down. It's recommended that you guide your dog to lie down without a treat. This is because you want your dog to learn the command without the expectation of receiving a reward. Using a treat to guide your dog to lie down can also create a dependency on treats. Continue practicing the 'down' command with your dog even after he has learned how to correctly lie down. Regular practice will help cement the command in your dog's memory and ensure that he understands it fully. In conclusion, teaching your dog the 'down' command is essential before attempting to teach him advanced tricks like playing dead. Choose a comfortable area to train your dog, command him to sit, stand directly in front of him, and guide him to lie down without a treat. Continued practice will ensure that your dog masters the 'down' command in no time."},{"instruction":"Article: According to author Michael Carrithers, while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account, the outline of the life must be true: birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death.

However, he also defended people's right to limit their tax obligations. The mayor's comments come after Labour leader Ed Miliband recently accused Prime Minister David Cameron of accepting donations from \\"dodgy\\" sources. Miliband's criticisms have sparked a wider controversy around tax avoidance in the UK. Many believe that wealthy individuals and corporations are not paying their fair share, with one estimate suggesting that the UK is losing up to £120bn per year due to tax avoidance. Johnson's comments come as part of a broader conversation about the role of taxation in modern society. While many agree that everyone should pay their fair share, there is significant disagreement about what that means in practice. Some argue that higher taxes are necessary to fund essential public services and address inequality, while others argue that this would stifle economic growth and discourage investment. The debate around tax avoidance has intensified in recent years, with high-profile cases such as that involving Panama Papers and many large corporations&rsquo; aggressive tax planning. However, the issue remains contentious, with many arguing that the current tax system is overly complex and fails to ensure that everyone contributes equitably. Despite the controversy, it is clear that taxation will remain a hot-button issue in the coming years.

This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records, hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s hifi era, when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before).

Despite overwhelming evidence that Obama was indeed born in Hawaii in 1961, a significant portion of the electorate continues to hold onto this conspiracy theory. According to Drew Westen, a psychology professor at Emory University, race is a key factor in this belief. He suggests that many people block out facts they dislike or that challenge their worldview. This is often referred to as confirmation bias, where people seek out information that confirms their preexisting beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. Furthermore, conspiracy theories have played a long-running role in American politics. Bill Mayer, a political science professor at Northeastern University, notes this in his research. From the assassination of President Kennedy to the 9/11 attacks, conspiracy theories have been a way for individuals to make sense of events that are difficult to understand. However, the persistence of the Obama birther movement is especially concerning because it is based on a racist and xenophobic myth. It suggests that someone who does not fit the traditional mold of a U.S. president – specifically, someone who is not white – must have been born elsewhere. Despite the overwhelming evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, the birther myth still persists among some segments of the U.S. population. This serves as a reminder of the power of confirmation bias and the danger of conspiracy theories.

Follow the same formula to count all the way up to 99.","output":"When learning how to count in Chinese, it is important to understand the basic formula used for counting from 1 to 99. The basic formula involves adding a number to the word for ten (十) in order to count up through 19. For example, to count from 11 to 19, you simply add the numbers 1 to 9 to 十. Here is an example of how to count up through 19: 1. 十一 (shí yī) - 11 2. 十二 (shí èr) - 12 3. 十三 (shí sān) - 13 4. 十四 (shí sì) - 14 5. 十五 (shí wǔ) - 15 6. 十六 (shí liù) - 16 7. 十七 (shí qī) - 17 8. 十八 (shí bā) - 18 9. 十九 (shí jiǔ) - 19 Once you reach 20, the word for 20 (二十) is used to count from 20 through 29. The formula remains the same - simply add the numbers 1 to 9 to 二十 to count from 21 to 29. Here is an example of how to count from 20 through 29: 1. 二十 (èr shí) - 20 2. 二十一 (èr shí yī) - 21 3. 二十二 (èr shí èr) - 22 4. 二十三 (èr shí sān) - 23 5. 二十四 (èr shí sì) - 24 6. 二十五 (èr shí wǔ) - 25 7. 二十六 (èr shí liù) - 26 8. 二十七 (èr shí qī) - 27 9. 二十八 (èr shí bā) - 28 10. 二十九 (èr shí jiǔ) - 29 From 30 through 99, the formula remains the same. Simply use the words for the tens (三十, 四十, 五十, etc.) and add the numbers 1 to 9 to count from 31 to 39, 41 to 49, 51 to 59, and so on. For example: 1. 三十 (sān shí) - 30 2. 三十一 (sān shí yī) - 31 3. 三十二 (sān shí èr) - 32 4. 四十 (sì shí) - 40 5. 五十 (wǔ shí) - 50 6. 六十 (liù shí) - 60 7. 七十 (qī shí) - 70 8. 八十 (bā shí) - 80 9. 九十 (jiǔ shí) - 90 10. 九十九 (jiǔ shí jiǔ) - 99 By following this basic formula, you can easily count from 1 to 99 in Chinese. Of course, there are some exceptions and irregularities in the language, but this will provide you with a solid foundation for counting and expressing numbers in Chinese."},{"instruction":"So what is gravity?

With the use of water and a tablecloth, a dramatic effect can be created, revealing a selected card face up. This simple yet effective trick can be used to add an extra layer of mystery to your card routines. To begin, select a card from the deck and set it aside. Wet the tablecloth with water and place it over the entire deck. Wait a few seconds, then lift the cloth to reveal that the selected card has magically appeared face up. This technique is known as the \\"water reveal\\" and it is a great way to reveal a card in a surprising and unexpected way. Another method to select a card is to deal cards one at a time, counting the letters in a person's name. For example, if the name is \\"David,\\" deal four cards and the last card dealt will be the selected card. This simple but effective technique is great for involving multiple participants in a trick. If you're performing for a group of people, you can have several participants pick a copy of the same card. All you need to do is make sure you have multiple copies of the same card in the deck. For more advanced tricks, you can riffle the deck to fool the audience by reversing the card order. This technique requires some careful sleight of hand, but it is sure to impress. Another advanced technique is the \\"double dilemma\\" trick, which involves splitting the deck in two and having your audience select a card from each half. You then magically bring the two cards back together as one. Finally, if you want to reveal the top card repeatedly, practice the \\"ambitious trick.\\" This is a classic card trick that involves repeatedly bringing the selected card to the top of the deck, no matter where it has been placed.

However, one aspect that is sometimes overlooked is the length and fastening method of the shoe. This article will provide guidance on how to choose the correct length and fastening method to ensure a perfect fit. The first step is to decide on the length of the shoe. It is essential to select a shoe length that corresponds to the size of your foot. Shoes that are too small or too big will not provide the proper support and can cause foot pain and other issues. One way to determine your shoe size is to stand on a piece of paper and trace the outline of your foot. Measure the length of the traced outline to determine the appropriate shoe size. Next, it is important to select a fastening method that works best for you. Shoes can come with various fastening methods such as laces, buckles, velcro or slip-on. Laces are a classic option that allows for a secure and customizable fit. Buckles are an excellent choice for dress shoes as they provide a polished look. Velcro shoes are easy to put on and take off and thus are an ideal option for children or people with mobility issues. Slip-on shoes are perfect for those who value convenience and comfort. Finally, make sure to try the shoes on before purchasing. Walk around in the shoes and check if they feel comfortable and supportive. Slight variations in sizing and fastening method can affect the overall fit of the shoe, so it is essential to try everything out. In conclusion, selecting the correct length and fastening method is crucial when purchasing shoes. Take the time to measure your foot size and select a fastening method that suits your lifestyle. Doing so will ensure a comfortable and enjoyable walking experience."},{"instruction":"what size engine does a 2000 chevy silverado have??","output":"The 2000 Chevy Silverado has a range of engine sizes from 4.3L, 4.8L, 5.3L, 6.0L, and 8.1L."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, eatType = restaurant, food = Indian, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 1 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes.

Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a byproduct of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion.

It's caused by a combination of viruses and bacteria and is commonly spread in places where large numbers of dogs congregate, such as kennels, boarding facilities, and dog parks. Symptoms of kennel cough include a dry, hacking cough, retching, and nasal discharge. If your dog is displaying these symptoms, it's important to take them to the vet for a diagnosis and treatment. While kennel cough is typically a mild illness that will resolve on its own within a few weeks, some dogs may develop more severe infections. Look for symptoms such as difficulty breathing, fever, and lethargy. If you notice any of these symptoms, seek veterinary care immediately as they can indicate a more serious condition. If your dog has been diagnosed with kennel cough, it's important to keep them away from other dogs until they have fully recovered. This can help prevent the spread of the infection to other dogs in the community. Your veterinarian may also recommend that you isolate your dog in a separate room while they recover. Treatment for kennel cough typically includes a course of antibiotics to help fight off the infection. In some cases, your veterinarian may also prescribe cough suppressants to alleviate your dog's symptoms. It's important to follow your veterinarian's instructions closely and administer all medications as directed. In addition to medication, there are several things you can do at home to help your dog recover from kennel cough. Encourage them to stay hydrated by making sure they have access to plenty of clean water. You can also try feeding your dog soft, moist food to make it easier for them to swallow. Finally, be sure to provide plenty of rest and comfort to help your dog feel better. In conclusion, kennel cough is a common and highly contagious illness in dogs. If you suspect your dog may be infected, it's important to seek veterinary care right away. Keep your dog away from other dogs to prevent the spread of infection, follow your veterinarian's recommendations for treatment and care, and be patient as your dog recovers. With proper treatment, most dogs will recover from kennel cough within a few weeks and return to their happy, healthy selves."},{"instruction":"Sometimes traits can vary from parent to offspring.

The MLB has already begun negotiating a settlement to grant A-Rod a lengthy suspension instead of a lifetime ban, ESPN and the New York Post reported. A-Rod has threatened to appeal any discipline that comes his way, so the MLB hopes to avoid the inevitable legal hassle with the suspension deal being considered.

Firstly, it's important to remove any excess tape using a gentle scraping tool, such as a plastic credit card or scraper. Next, dab the affected area with rubbing alcohol to break down the adhesive. Be sure to use a small amount of alcohol and avoid rubbing too vigorously to prevent damage to the surface. If the tape residue is particularly tough to budge, using an iron can be effective. Before you start, make sure the surface is suitable for heat exposure. Place a sheet of wax paper or parchment over the residue and apply the iron on a low heat setting. The heat will melt the adhesive and the wax paper will allow you to lift the residue away from the surface. If none of these methods work, it's best to call in professionals to steam clean the area. They will have the necessary equipment and expertise to remove the tape residue without causing any damage to the surface. In summary, removing tape residue can be a frustrating task, but with a little bit of patience and the right tools and techniques, it can be done.

Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object.

Our Sun transforms nuclear potential energy to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as radiant energy.

The Thalattoarchon saurophagis was a 28-foot-long marine reptile that lived around 244 million years ago. Its name translates to 'lizard-eating sovereign of the sea', and it was indeed the king of the ocean during its time. The Thalattoarchon saurophagis had an elongated body with paddle-like limbs that allowed it to swim effortlessly through the water. It had a long snout filled with razor-sharp teeth that were perfect for catching and devouring prey. Its size and strength made it a dominant predator that could take down even the most formidable creatures in the sea. The Thalattoarchon saurophagis is classified as a member of the ichthyosaurs - a group of marine reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic era. These creatures were not dinosaurs but evolved from a common ancestor that lived around 250 million years ago. The discovery of the Thalattoarchon saurophagis was made in the Augusta Mountains in central Nevada. It was found by a team of researchers led by University of Nevada, Las Vegas geologist, Mark S. McMenamin. The team discovered the remains of the creature's skull, vertebrae, and other bones.

Despite the fall of long-time dictator Hosni Mubarak, the country's current situation remains disappointing for many. The upcoming presidential elections have seen some voters shift their allegiances to different candidates, searching for leaders who they believe will truly represent their interests. One of the key criticisms of the revolution has been the lack of a clear post-revolution strategy. According to political analyst Abdelaziz, the revolutionary movement failed to articulate a plan for how to move forward beyond the immediate overthrow of the government. As a result, the post-revolutionary period has been chaotic and uncertain, with no clear path forward for the country. Despite this disappointment, activists on the ground stress that change takes time. \\"Nothing changes overnight,\\" one noted.

Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two nonbridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be achieved by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds. Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) have to take this in account.","output":"The title of this article is not provided."},{"instruction":"Write a positive tweet.","output":"\\"Today is a new day to be grateful for all the blessings in my life. #gratitude #positivity\\""},{"instruction":"– Mark Zuckerberg has joined another exclusive club: that of tech CEOs so fabulously wealthy they can afford to take a 1 salary.

Astonishing imprint spotted by Stuart Milligan at his home last week. Greasy nature appears to be 'powder down' which protects feathers.","output":"Stirling resident Stuart Milligan was shocked to find a strange, greasy imprint on his kitchen window last week. Upon closer inspection, Milligan realized that the imprint was made by a pigeon and was likely a result of the bird's \\"powder down\\" substance. Powder down is a greasy substance that can be found on the feathers of certain birds, including pigeons. This substance helps to protect the feathers and keep them in good condition. When a bird preens, it spreads the powder down across its feathers, which helps to keep them waterproof. In the case of Milligan's kitchen window, it seems that a pigeon landed on the window and left behind an imprint made of powder down. The imprint is a fascinating sight to behold and serves to remind us of the incredible adaptations that birds have developed over millions of years of evolution. Although the imprint may be a bit of a nuisance for Milligan to clean up, it's an astonishing reminder of the fascinating creatures that share our planet. Pigeons, in particular, are a ubiquitous part of urban environments around the world, and their resilience and ability to adapt to human habitats is a testament to their remarkable survival skills. For Milligan and others who may encounter similar imprints in the future, the greasy nature of the markings should serve as a reminder of the complex biology and natural world that surrounds us every day. While it may be easy to take the world around us for granted, even something as simple as a greasy imprint on a window can serve as a reminder of the incredible complexities and wonders of the natural world."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = Strada, eatType = pub, food = Japanese, customer rating = low, near = Yippee Noodle Bar.

One major factor in the closure of the western posts was the declining demand for fur, which was a key commodity for the trade posts. As the 19th century progressed, many factors contributed to the decline in demand for fur. One factor was the development of new, more efficient hunting methods that allowed fur traders to harvest larger amounts of fur with less effort. Another factor was the introduction of synthetic materials that could mimic the look and feel of natural fur, making it a more cost-effective alternative for consumers. Beyond these changes in the economy and technology, western posts were also impacted by political events. The end of the fur trade played a significant role in the closure of western posts, as companies struggled to adapt to changing conditions and compete with newcomers to the market. Ultimately, the closure of western posts represents both a historical moment in the evolution of the fur trade, and a cautionary example of the way that changing economic and political conditions can shape and reshape industries over time. While the legacy of the western posts lives on in the memories of those who worked and traded there, their closure underscores the importance of being able to adapt to changing conditions in order to succeed in any industry."},{"instruction":"What most naturally follows?

At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.

Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions as many acidbase reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest.

Much of the early paper made from wood pulp contained significant amounts of alum, a variety of aluminium sulfate salts that is significantly acidic.

Early papermakers did not realize that the alum they added liberally to cure almost every problem encountered in making their product would eventually be detrimental. The cellulose fibres that make up paper are hydrolyzed by acid, and the presence of alum would eventually degrade the fibres until the paper disintegrated in a process that has come to be known as slow fire.

Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as Slovin and Illyrian (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque panSlavism) and Croat – these 30odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the prenational era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia.

Pronunciation is a critical aspect of language learning, as it affects the clarity of your communication. Paying attention to the standard pronunciation of a language will allow you to convey your thoughts effectively. Listen to native speakers and try to imitate their intonation and stress patterns.

Understanding the basic rules will give you the tools to create more complex sentences. Memorizing words and phrases is a fundamental element of language learning. Focus on the most common words and expressions that you're likely to use in everyday conversation. Create flashcards, use vocabulary apps, or simply write them down on a piece of paper. Aim to memorize at least 30 words or phrases each day, and use them actively in your conversations. Finally, practicing the alphabet might seem like a trivial task, but it is essential to learn the writing system of any language. Familiarizing yourself with the alphabet will help you recognize the different sounds of the language and the written form of the words.

Here's how each of these practices can benefit you. Firstly, taking the time to write down what you are grateful for can have a profound impact on your mindset. Gratitude helps shift your focus from what you don't have to what you do have, creating a sense of abundance rather than scarcity. This practice can lead to increased feelings of contentment and happiness. Volunteering is another way to boost your mood and contribute to the greater good. Helping others can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and has been linked to increased life satisfaction. Practicing self-compassion involves treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and forgiveness. We often criticize ourselves harshly, but with self-compassion, we can learn to accept our imperfections and treat ourselves with the same compassion we would offer a friend. Laughter is a powerful antidote to stress, and has many physical and emotional benefits. It can reduce tension, boost immunity, and even relieve pain. When we laugh, we release endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Finally, offering compliments to others can not only brighten their day but also create positive social connections. When we express our appreciation for others, it can help foster a sense of community and encourage positive interactions. Incorporating these practices into your daily life may seem small, but over time they can have a significant impact on your well-being. By focusing on gratitude, volunteering, self-compassion, laughter, and compliments, you can cultivate a more positive mindset and increase your overall happiness."},{"instruction":"Write a positive movie review.","output":"Movie Review: \\"A Star is Born\\" \\"A Star is Born\\" is a captivating movie that captures the essence of love, passion, and music.

In the late 1930s, Romania was faced with territorial claims from neighboring countries, particularly Hungary and Bulgaria, over parts of its territory. These claims threatened Romania's security and led to its pursuit of alliances that would guarantee its territorial integrity. One of the main options for Romania was to align itself with the Soviet Union, which was seen as a potential counterbalance to Hungarian and Bulgarian expansionism. However, the Soviet Union's Communist ideology was perceived as a threat to Romania's monarchy and its conservative political establishment. As a result, Romania looked to Germany for support. In 1939, Romania signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Germany and the Soviet Union, which provided for the division of Eastern Europe between the two powers. Romania received assurances from Germany that its territorial claims would be respected and that it would be protected against external threats. Romania's alliance with Germany was reinforced by its dependence on German military and economic aid. Germany was Romania's largest trading partner, and the Romanian economy relied heavily on trade with Germany. Moreover, Germany helped Romania modernize its armed forces by providing weapons, training and military advisors. Romania's alignment with the Axis powers was also driven by a desire to regain territories lost after World War I. In 1940, Romania was forced to cede the provinces of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and parts of Transylvania to Hungary. These territorial losses were seen as a national humiliation, and led to the rise of nationalist and fascist movements in Romania that advocated a greater alignment with Germany. Overall, Romania joined the Axis powers primarily to protect its territorial interests and secure its borders against external threats. However, its alliance with Germany ultimately proved disastrous, as it led to the country's participation in the war on the wrong side, with devastating consequences for Romania and its people."},{"instruction":"Joindate:February9,2012 Please segment the words.","output":"\\"Join date: February 9, 2012\\" - The words are already segmented in the given instruction."},{"instruction":"Concepts: city, light, traffic Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"The city streets were bright with flashing lights and heavy traffic."},{"instruction":"Beyoncé: The release of a videogame Starpower: Beyoncé was cancelled after Beyoncé pulled out of a 100 million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.

Hewitt responded to Mr Hose, writing: 'We have found your evidence... most helpful and I think it has certainly been taken into account' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In December 1975, Keith Hose, the chairman of the Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE), wrote a letter to Patricia Hewitt, who was then the General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL). Hose urged Hewitt to consider the views of PIE regarding the age of consent. This letter has recently surfaced and has caused controversy in light of current attitudes towards pedophilia. Hewitt replied to Hose's letter by thanking him for his submission and stating that the NCCL had found the evidence presented by PIE to be \\"most helpful\\" and that it would be taken into account. This exchange of letters has led to accusations that the NCCL was supportive of pedophilia in the 1970s. However, it is important to note that at the time, there was a broad debate around age of consent laws in the UK. Many groups, including feminists and gay rights activists, were arguing that the age of consent should be lowered or abolished altogether. The NCCL was one of these groups and was campaigning for the age of consent to be lowered from 21 to 16. It is worth noting that PIE was a fringe organization and was not widely accepted or supported by the mainstream. PIE's views on the age of consent were extreme and out of step with public opinion. Furthermore, Hewitt has since apologized for her involvement with the NCCL and has stated that she regrets that her organization had any association with PIE. In conclusion, the exchange of letters between Keith Hose and Patricia Hewitt has caused controversy and raised questions about attitudes towards pedophilia in the 1970s. However, it is important to contextualize this exchange within the broader debate around age of consent laws at the time. While the NCCL was campaigning for a lower age of consent, it did not support or condone pedophilia, and PIE's views were widely rejected by the mainstream."},{"instruction":"f A little girl, wearing a coat, on pavement bricks., can we conclude The girl has blond hair.?

However, it is important to remember that these properties can also be dangerous and potentially illegal to enter without permission. If you are considering exploring abandoned properties, there are several essential steps that you should follow to ensure your safety and to respect the property. Step 1: Gather Information About the Property Before you explore an abandoned property, it is important to gather as much information about it as possible. This can include researching the property’s history and current ownership, as well as identifying any hazards or potential dangers that may be present. Step 2: Get Permission If the property is privately owned, you must obtain permission from the owner before exploring it. You can contact the owner directly or reach out to local agencies such as the city government or historical societies to seek permission. Trespassing on private property can result in legal consequences, so it’s important to respect the owner’s rights. Step 3: Notify Local Police While exploring abandoned properties, there is always the risk of encountering illegal activity or dangerous individuals. To protect yourself and others, it’s essential to notify local police of your plans and whereabouts. They can provide guidance and support, as well as respond quickly in case of an emergency. Step 4: Take Necessary Safety Precautions Once you have permission to explore the property, take necessary safety precautions. This includes wearing appropriate clothing and protective gear, bringing plenty of water and food, and being vigilant for hazards such as broken glass, sharp objects, or unstable structures. Step 5: Be Respectful of the Property Lastly, it is important to be respectful of the abandoned property. Avoid damaging any structures or property, and refrain from removing any objects from the site. As a visitor, it is your responsibility to leave the property in the same condition that you found it. In summary, exploring abandoned properties can be a fascinating experience, but it requires careful planning and precautions to ensure safety and respect for the property. By following these essential steps, you can enjoy your exploration while minimizing the risks and potential legal consequences."},{"instruction":"worthy addition How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?
