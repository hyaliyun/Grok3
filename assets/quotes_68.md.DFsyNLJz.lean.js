I‚Äôm not going to say it‚Äôs terrible, because not all of them think that. To me, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôve been teaching awhile and students really enjoy school and their lives until middle school. It‚Äôs gets harder, the material they have to learn and memorize dramatically increases, and most of them have to attend academies for math, science, and English.

Some may not have the income, but parents do everything humanly possible to send their kids to academies. It‚Äôs important to them and it‚Äôs a social status symbol as well. Most high school students also have ‚Äústudy rooms‚Äù that they go to. When tests and big exams are on the horizon, kids are often at the academy until midnight and on weekends.

I was in my second year as an academic - and knew that was really what I wanted to do for a living. I was also in my second year of marriage to the woman I met in grad school, five years earlier. We had a nice apartment, had bought a new Porsche (back in the days when real people could afford them), had spent the previous summer on a long road trip (tent camping along the way - not a lot of room in that Porsche!). There was a lot to look forward to. After all those years in grad school, postponing real life, in a way, we were enjoying real life. Would I go back, if I could? Yeah ‚Ä¶ that would be cool. it was a great time! Can you make that happen? Would I do things differently? Sure, some things. But none of the big decisions would be much different. We had a good life - even when things didn‚Äôt go the way we wanted. But most of what seemed like tragedies at the time, were not actually tragedies. Somehow, I didn‚Äôt expect the last half-century to go by so quickly. And I guess that is the message I would like to convey in this. Even though at the time things can seem hard, they do pass. But that also goes for opportunities, as well. And what can seem so important when you are young are not important at all. So live your life in a way that any regrets are just small ones - things you would like to do a bit differently. But even at 81 life is good. I lost that bright, funny, and cute bride I had when I was thirty - to cancer after forty-three years. So there‚Äôs that. But life is still good, and there is still a lot to look forward to - and I realize I have been so very lucky."},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"Shahrukh Khan, also known as the King of Bollywood, is a globally recognized actor and one of the most successful stars in the Indian film industry.

While there are many well-known productivity strategies, here are some unique tips and tricks that can help boost productivity: The Pomodoro Technique with a Twist: The Pomodoro Technique involves working in focused bursts followed by short breaks. To add a twist, customize the time intervals to suit your concentration span. Experiment with longer or shorter work periods to find what works best for you.Reverse To-Do Lists: Instead of creating a traditional to-do list, try making a reverse to-do list. Start by listing the tasks you've completed or actions you've already taken. This approach provides a sense of accomplishment and motivates you to keep going.Mindful Microtasks: Break down complex projects into small, manageable tasks. Focus on one microtask at a time, bringing mindfulness and full attention to each. This prevents overwhelm and helps maintain focus on the present moment.The Two-Minute Rule: If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately rather than adding it to a to-do list. This prevents small tasks from accumulating and frees up mental space for more substantial work.Visualize Success: Take a moment to visualize yourself successfully completing a task or achieving a goal. This mental exercise can boost motivation, enhance focus, and instill a sense of confidence.Adopt a \\"No-Meeting Day\\": Dedicate one day each week where no meetings are scheduled. This allows uninterrupted time for deep work and concentrated focus on priority tasks.Single-Tasking Sprints: Set aside short bursts of time to focus solely on one task without any distractions. During these sprints, eliminate interruptions, turn off notifications, and give your undivided attention to the task at hand.Embrace Strategic Procrastination: Sometimes, delaying tasks can lead to better results. Identify tasks that benefit from incubation or when fresh perspectives are required. Procrastinate strategically, allowing your subconscious mind to work on solutions in the background.Energizing Microbreaks: Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media during breaks, engage in activities that energize and recharge you. Stretch, take a walk outside, practice deep breathing, or engage in a short mindfulness exercise.Experiment and Iterate: Productivity is highly personal, so experiment with different techniques, tools, and routines to discover what works best for you. Continuously evaluate and refine your approach to productivity based on your unique needs and preferences. Remember, productivity is a journey, and finding what works for you may require some trial and error. Stay open-minded, embrace new strategies, and be adaptable in your pursuit of enhanced productivity."},{"instruction":"f you walk into a buffet restaurant technically during their lunch times but leave during dinner times assuming they are two different prices which price do you get charged?","output":"Lots of buffet restaurants have more offerings during dinner service than lunch, the price is higher as a result. When I was a kid, my friends and I used to go to Old Country Buffet to eat lunch. We hit upon the idea of showing up late, paying for lunch and sticking around to eat the dinner items, which included higher ticket offerings like prime rib and fried shrimp. The restaurants know that people will try this, so they stop seating diners for a period of time between lunch and dinner. This gives the late lunch comers time to finish their food and eat their fill of lunch items before the dinner items are set onto the line for the dinner customers. If you try to hang out until dinner is served, they kick you out. I know, because I‚Äôve gotten kicked out. They‚Äôre nice about it, but it‚Äôs still kicking you out.

Finding what you need to improve on is a process of Self-Reflection, that also takes a degree of Self-Discipline. Notice how there is a lot of Self involved in all of these, and that is for a reason. Alas you cannot improve your life in any way with first improving yourself, and then you have the literal capacity to improve. I take these to be defined as SKILLS and HABITS. Here is a list of things that you need in order to be successful in life, including your pursuits of development. (The reason behind asking the question in the first place! haha) Self-Reflection Looking back on my life I have experienced a lot in a short time span, many things that most people would feel greatly sympathetic to me, but I personally have moved on from. There is no use in being STUCK in the past, moreover I am a future oriented person. Alas there is a need to reflect upon your past endeavors, your experiences, and your life as a whole. Creating a sense of synchronicity, as well as establishing a baseline for yourself. Self-Discipline In order to reflect you first need to make a habit of meditation, as with any habit it takes patience and discipline to create. Though I feel with the society we have spirituality is greatly lost with many people, so things like meditation have been overlooked, though some schools are now practicing it instead of detention! Meditation can be a great tool to understand your life, and be a mental workout for your discipline muscle. Self-Awareness Gary Vee is a great speaker, he and others (like Tony Robbins, Robin Sharma, etc) often speaks on the importance of Self-Awareness. The ability to know who you are, and this can be probably the hardest of all of them. Developing this is crucial, and once you do things start to become much clearer. Think how the character in ‚ÄúLimitless‚Äù opens up after taking NZT. Obviously you‚Äôre not taking a drug, but the effect is a lower version of that. Things just start to be much more expressed. Self-Determination/Self-Motivation Originally this was going to be two separate topics, but I felt that they corresponded well with each other. The necessity of DRIVE is something that cannot be ignored. In the sense of things this is where passion generally gets involved. My passion is to #makechange in the world, and I am on Quora because of this, and I come on trying to give people valuable answers. Sometimes it can be hard, especially considering most are sizable like this, but my motivation to help people is stronger than my urge to go watch YouTube, for example. Motivating yourself is a great way to become a stronger person in general, plus inducing your confidence. Finally, Self-Development as a Whole Ok, really you have to put ALL of this together, and even all of that wouldn‚Äôt fully constitute Self-Development. Though I think this is a great starting point, and I find that most people cannot even dream of success in any endeavor if any more than ONE of these skills above are weak. Hell I would go even as far to say that even if one of them is weak that you will fail. It takes a lot, and the reason why I answered your question this way is because of it‚Äôs importance. Lets say someone else‚Äôs answer gives you the thing you were looking for and you go full on towards that goal. Though your Self-Development is non-existent, then you would just fail on that goal. I don‚Äôt know your life, maybe you are great at Self-Development, but just in the slim case that you (or any other readers! <3) are reading this you can improve your life!!

The referential implication of the question has enough force to disagree with my constitution almost immediately. In other words, to my mind, it relays the organic impression of gross excess. The best way to explain this feeling, is being congested. Congested, that is, with food my body does not need. Why do I have the above response to the question? Because the question, in its referential implication, espouses 3 meals a day - implicitly urging my complicity. Readers might draw from the above dialogue somebody‚Äôs visceral response to food consumption. If you drew such an inference, you would be damn right. Except that my visceral response is directed at what amounts to Over-Consumption. My idea of over-consumption is 2 meals a day. Before you freak out, you should let me expand. I have determined that food consumption can be imagined as an acquired habit. It certainly would not seem so from a telescopic view. I shall offer you an intimate close up view by whose grace all becomes clear. CONSUMPTION AND THE PERILS OF HABITUAL INDULGENCE I know this well. Most people are inured to the perils of habitual indulgence. It is not only that humans are habitual creatures - I actually have no problem with that - it is that food consumption seems to have lost its original significance at the organic level. If you live in America, for instance, you know that there is food everywhere - the ones people should eat and most that nobody should. In the American milieu, there is actually a contraction of what is absolutely healthy for consumption over a protracted period. There is the argument that food is food and that people should consume whatever they so desire. From the standpoint of political correctness, that is certainly true. Except that if I am your fitness trainer, consuming whatever you so desire is a no go. If I become a pain in the ass, you can fire me and go back to eating junk. But NO JUNK on my watch. People who are emotional eaters can take refuge behind the disquieting fact that even in the field of health and fitness, there are many physically fit people who desire to over-indulge every now and again. Some of these folks have to torture themselves by heavy workout just to makeup for these disastrous emotional departures. What does that signal to you? That food consumption is an epidermic. It confirms the unspoken suspicion that even the best among us have not as yet solved the ever- present defeatist relationship with food consumption. I am not a stranger to this state of affairs. I actually have my own idea about the neurobiologic element at play. CONSUMPTIVE BEHAVIOR AS SOCIAL RITUAL As a staunch individualist, I believe that necessity is the furnace that sparks invention. It is my felt conviction that there are other people in America like me for whom two meals a day is more food than the body requires. There are also others like me who understand that overindulgence vitiates the energy balance we need to accomplish tasks. What seems to happen is that the social milieu rewards the practice of 3 meals a day plus whatever else between those meals. The social complicity in this state of affairs obfuscates all the apparent perils resident in this social behavior. As you can obviously imagine, the question about consuming less food than the typical 3 meals a day becomes almost obscene to a lot of people. It‚Äôs as though people‚Äôs response would be: Of course, humans are supposed to eat food 3 times a day. Which is completely FALSE. It is false because nobody is organically encoded with such a necessity. Practice makes any behavior a normalized event. That is, no matter how unnatural. History is essentially profuse with all kinds of things that never used to exist - but which most people in contemporary currency could not possibly live without. It‚Äôs called Behavioral Plasticity. Whatever habit one fabricates ultimately congeals in the fullness of time. Hey, that is a great thing. Why? Because the same pertains to great life-affirming ones as well. Like eating a single great meal a day. I am a performance expert. I am tasked with re-formulating how people do what they do. Construe that as deconstructing ill-advised modes of performing. A much more consonant choreographic expression of behavior exists at your fingertips. BREAKING THE PATHOLOGICAL BOND Shall we revisit the text of the question at hand. It is an inquiry into how people can eat one or two meals a day without experiencing hunger pangs. The questioner clearly betrays an insalubrious relationship with food consumption. Many readers may not think so. Here is why they should: The question is basically about 2 meals a day being a hunger strike. Seriously? I am wondering how much more would be acceptable to our questioner. Unbeknownst to the multitude, you are not doing your body a favor using food to self-pamper. Chances of consuming more than necessary is built into repetitive consumption. So is consuming the wrong food items. But even worse: You will have denied your system the opportunity to repair itself. Consider the wisdom resident in the following idea: It could be said that from a higher angle of view, it is no longer about eating good food; but more about training the body to RESILE over the absence of food. There is a great reason for that: The resilience of the human spirit is veritably powerful when stretched. When it comes to Body Repair, the best food in the world may not cut it: desisting from consumption DOES. Let me pose an example first. It‚Äôs like a great joke. It‚Äôs great the first and second time. It dies after that. But it‚Äôs exactly the same joke. Surprise! Your body responds exactly the same way. Hunger energizes Growth Hormones; Neuroplasticity awakens; AUTOPHAGY sets in ready for cellular rejuvenation as insulin normalizes. Hunger frees the body to reach for actuating its own potential. Elsewhere, I have shared that after a 24 or 48-hour DRY FAST, everything tastes outa this world. No matter what the food is. If you need a new addiction - I just landed you one! It‚Äôs the best thing. But like everything the body usually does, that feeling goes away until you repeat the fast. Mark you, your body remembers and records this experience - rewarding you incrementally every time you fast. In due course, you will not necessarily need to fast to receive the reward - get it? Here is a priceless hint for ya: If you want to kill an addiction like sweet stuff, smoking, drugs for example, FAST. Fasting, naturally, makes you hungry like hell. Now that‚Äôs a priceless feeling. Why? Because YOU WILL EAT ANYTHING. Celebrate the opportunity by doing this: Drink and munch on something you would normally not munch on that is actually good for you. You will have reprogrammed your habituation. If you are smart and serious about making that desperate change, this is your chance. Eat nothing that is not good for you from THIS POINT forward. You will notice that you can now FEEL the center of your body for the first time in a rather long time. You love that feeling. Great! That‚Äôs exactly how you ought to feel each and every day. That is the way I feel. You would have to kill me to take that feeling away. It is my cue for being alive! You will have discovered your own personal ZERO POINT. The Zero Point in brief: It means 2 things: (a) Your youthful, energetic self; (b) A point at which you can go no further south - a new starting point; a reboot; a point of conviction for a new direction. I have determined that THE ABSENCE OF THIS CENTERED FEELING is the main reason many people over-consume. You see, they have nothing to lose. There is no promise. There is no principle. There is no nostalgic remembrance. Consumption supplants that feeling. People do in fact turn away from their evil ways, so to speak. But something has to make them do it - if you get my drift. Once you begin to enjoy getting back to your core body, hoohoo! You are new. CONCLUSION I purposely decided to veer off the text of the question as asked; but rather, to expand upon what the question failed to ask; which is, how consumption really works below our normal awareness. There are so many nuances that evade the normal processes of engaging with food consumption. I am acutely cognizant of the delicate abstractions, as it were, because of my health and fitness background. My own body is the instrument at play in what I do For example, an area of understanding related to malnutritional, micronutrient deficiencies in consumption could shed light on why people return to food consumption almost inadvertently. It is the case that people are eating but they are actually not FEEDING the body at core - if you know what I mean. The natural impulsion is to keep eating - because you are actually still UNFED at core. And finally, the multitude out there has, as a collective, missed out on using the human sensorial facility to gauge what food is actually accomplishing or not. I have spent years expanding my sensorial aptitude so you don‚Äôt have to. Godfrey Silas"},{"instruction":"Why is Gov. Kristi Noem South Dakota suing the Biden administration over fireworks at Mt.

Most single speed fans have two specifications, The fully locked rotor current, and the normal ‚Äúrunning current‚Äù. But, you need to ‚Äútime‚Äù the duration that the fan is ‚Äúon‚Äù, and the time the fan is ‚Äúoff‚Äù during One hour Intervals beginning with the next ‚Äúon cycle‚Äù. Why? Here is how it it is supposed to work: When your house temperature is less than 15 degrees C outside, the furnace warms the home to +20C. But when the temperature drops to 0C or -10C, then the furnace has to work harder and harder to replace that heat lost to the outside. So, when it is at +15 outside, the furnace may run 5% of the time in the on time. But when it is -40 then it may be running 80to 85% of the time. Why? Because your furnace is rated for x amount of heat units per hour of running time. If your house ‚Äúleaks‚Äù 80% of the X value, then the fan will run 82% of the time. Circulating the air the other 18% of the time will not save much energy, since it (the heater part) is on fo 80% of the time. The startup current (full locked value) only happens for a brief second, while the rotor starts. This might be 20 amps. But when running, the motor needs 7 amps.

Google Maps is the best iPhone navigation app. With [LINKED_TEXT: Apple Maps] [URL: https://amzn.to/3j8DZRT], Apple is making a gallant effort. But everyone is aware that Apple Maps isn't quite \\"there.\\" Therefore, we advise you to install Google Maps, which is undoubtedly the greatest navigation programme available for all platforms, while Apple engineers work to improve Apple Maps. Even when you are offline, it functions properly. Before you venture into the wilderness, make sure you obtain the offline map data. Best personalization app for iPhone: Color Widgets Contrary to Android, which allows you to customize your smartphone's user interface to look nothing like, well, Android, iOS customization tools are only available for changing the wallpaper and experimenting with different widgets. Install this software called Color Widgets, which we really enjoyed, if you really miss Android's customizability choices. With well over 216K reviews, it has an App Store rating of 4.6 stars. So you can be sure that it won't be entirely awful. Best Browser for iPhone: Google Chrome: From the time when it forbade third-party browsers from being used on its App Store, Apple has come a long way. Apart from Apple's own Safari, which comes pre-installed on all iOS devices, you have a wide range of options today. There is no disputing that Google Chrome for iOS is a feature-rich, quick browser, whether you love it or hate it. And among the remainder of the iOS options, Google Chrome, in our opinion, stands out. Best Security app for iPhone: Avast Security & Privacy Avast is a well-known brand in the cybersecurity industry and is renowned for its top-notch PC and Mac protection products. For those who don't know, the business also produces the fantastic iOS security app Avast Security & Privacy.

Top messaging app for iOS: Telegram While the vast majority of iOS users in the US are addicted to iMessage, WhatsApp is the messaging app of choice for the vast majority of people worldwide. However, we have chosen not to include WhatsApp in this list because to recent privacy-related problems. We also had Signal in mind as a potential app. We are forced to give this app to Telegram because it currently doesn't have a big active userbase. With over 500 million users, the Russian-born programmed has a sizable user base that places it maybe second only to WhatsApp. What else? There are several things in it that even WhatsApp has not yet included. Best weather app for iOS: Accuweather For a number of reasons, Accuweather is considered the \\"best weather app\\" for iOS. In addition to being a feature-rich, well-designed software. The weather forecasting abilities of Accuweather have frequently drawn praise. On fact, we selected this app as the top weather app in the Android version of this post for the same reason. Best dating app for iOS: Tinder The only reason Tinder is at the top of this list is because it attracts the majority of daters. Naturally, it makes sense for us to suggest a dating app where your chances of meeting a new mate are the highest. Yes, there may other dating apps with a superior user interface and feature set, but Tinder offers a better possibility of achieving your goal of installing a dating app. Best camera app for iPhone: ProCamera For those who take their iPhone photography seriously, ProCamera has been the go-to software for taking excellent photographs and films.

It has won a lot of praise for being a user-friendly programme for beginners while yet being packed with features that experts appreciate! Best photo storage app for iPhone: Degoo The majority of iPhone users could lean toward backing up their images using either iCloud or Google Photos. Since Google Photos just became a paid service as well, there was a glaring market gap that Degoo Backup AG, a small Swedish startup, appears to have exploited. Enter Degoo, an enticing photo storage service that provides its basic users with a respectable 100 GB of free space. For a subscription fee of 9.99 a month, you can get up to 10 TB of space.

In conclusion, using Strava makes sense if you are starting from scratch. Best step-counting app for iOS: Pacer Pedometer Our top recommendation for the best step counter app is Pacer Pedometer. Even though it's a great app for people who just want to use it as a pedometer, using it will show you that it also has a tonne of other useful features. The software is essentially designed to be a fitness buddy that motivates users to stay active. Similar to Strava, Pacer Pedometer boasts a vibrant community. Best calorie counting app for iOS: YAZIO Fasting & Food Tracker One of the most well-known calorie counting apps on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store is Yazio. The app's broad success appears to be due to the fact that it is a highly well-made, feature-rich, and cost-free software. Keep in mind that there is a Pro edition with additional features. Apart from supporting a wide library of foods along with recipes and meal plans, it features automatic activity tracking as well. Best music streaming app for iOS: Spotify In terms of features and the breadth of its music catalogue, Spotify is unquestionably the best and most widely used music streaming service on the internet. For obvious reasons, this was probably the choice we had to make for this story. Best movie streaming app for iOS: Netflix If you read the Android version of this post (where we discuss the best Android apps), you would know that Netflix was selected by our editor Antoine as the finest movie streaming service in our in-depth piece on SVOD platforms, so there isn't much more we can say about it. If you could only download one movie streaming app for your phone, it would have to be Netflix. Best e-book reader app for iOS: Amazon Kindle As with the other two choices in this section, this was pretty obvious, right? Anyway, it is nearly difficult to overlook Amazon when discussing electronic books and eBook readers in general.

It even has a note-taking feature, which makes it an extremely flexible productivity tool that goes much beyond the requirements of a basic email software.

Cooking is a wonderful space for creativity and innovation. It teaches you a lot of things like organizing, keeping things in order, management, and also multi-tasking, which can help you to be a productive person in real life. As for me, I have been cooking for the past 2 years and now I have a blog called Tripping on Earth, dedicated to food and travel, and I know, cooking looks like a daunting task and time wastage for some but for me, it was the most wonderful thing that I could have learned. It made me self-dependent, and an ordeal person. When I decided to cook, these are the things that helped me a lot during my first time and I hope it can help you too: Grab the cooking master of your house Everyone has someone in their household that makes food for the entire family, and that person usually is your mother. So, when starting to cook, ask your mother for some tips, and take help from her in the kitchen, it can help you a lot. She has a lot more experience in this area than anybody in the house (except for grandmothers). Check out youtube videos and blogs This is an important one, so pay close attention! When I first started cooking, I checked out every youtube video and blog on food recipes, how to chop vegetables, different methods of cutting vegetables, what are the uses of spices, and even things like which utensils are the best for making food. I made a mistake though I picked a difficult recipe to make on my first try, so make sure you pick a recipe that can be made within 30 mins or so. Practice, Fail, Repeat After choosing a decent but not too difficult food recipe to make, keep in mind it won‚Äôt turn out to be as you hoped, in fact, it might not even be edible, even after following every step of that youtube video or blog. But don‚Äôt lose your heart, just keep on practicing and making food regardless of they turn out to be and I promise you, you will make a dish that will blow your socks off given that you keep at it. I also made terrible dishes, food that had to be thrown in the bin for the first 3 times but on the 4th and the 5th, the food turned out to be not so bad, and eventually, I made the perfect dish!

Department: Electrical Post applied for: Officer/Engineer We entered the building exactly at 8:00 a.m. and after sometime the presentation (or the pre-placement talk) started in a conference hall. After a beautiful presentation, we were given tags or sort of identity cards with numbers on them. Mine was Kolkata -1, 16. FYI, there were 27 candidates allotted for the day from electrical domain and atleast 7 of them were absent. After we all had our breakfast, document verification process started which took a lot of time. My GD/GT started at around 12:00 p.m. There were 2 moderators and 8 candidates in the group. The topic for GD was ‚ÄúRetirement room is the ultimate destination of the old age people‚Äù. 2 mins were given for jotting down the points( a board and a paper were given to us). It continued for around 10 minutes. Then the moderator asked each of us to conclude. The topic for GT was ‚ÄúPlan proper ways to make an ecologically sustainable city‚Äù. 3 mins were given to write down points. Everyone of us gave valuable points and after 10 mins, we were asked to conclude. As one member was mid-way concluding, another member intervened and added another point and then another member followed him. I guess this could have put a negative impact. Apart from that, everything was pretty smooth. After sometime, I was called for the interview. I entered and greeted them. There were 5 members- 2 female and 3 male. Fore ease of understanding, let‚Äôs denote them as F1, F2 and M1,M2,M3 and myself as V. F1 : Well Mr. Vivek, tell us something about yourself. V: I told everything including hobbies, strengths and weaknesses. M1: What was your final year project? V: Designing of Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle commonly known as Drone M1: What are the applications of drone? V: I told everything I prepared. F1: You said your hobby is watching Sci-fi movies, which sci-fi have you watched recently? V: Interstellar F1: Haven‚Äôt you watched Avengers Endgame? V: Yes mam, but I recently watched Interstellar again as it‚Äôs my favorite movie. (By this time, I became pretty comfortable) F1: So, you said you tend to fumble while speaking when you are nervous, why does it happen? V: I explained to them how my lack of confidence gets the better of me at certain situations. But then I said that I am working on it. F2: So, you like teaching, whom do you teach and which subject? V: Mostly, from 6th standard to 10th. I used to teach Mathematics and Computer earlier, now I teach only computer, mostly, the coding part. F2: Why don‚Äôt you teach higher secondary students? V: Mam, I prefer teaching the basics to the students than the advanced part because I feel if I can make them love this subject at this age then may be they will willingly pursue their career in it. She was pretty satisfied with my answer. F2: You have only one strength? (I have mentioned only one strength in my intro, that‚Äôs why). Any other strength? V: (I almost forgot my other strength and was speechless for few seconds then suddenly, I remembered)Mam, I always try to learn from my mistakes. F2: Ohh, so you learn after doing plunders. (She mumbled) Quickly, she went to the other question. F2: There are so many candidates out there, why should we hire you? What makes you different? V: I emphasized on my strengths (that I can adjust to any situation easily) and said that every firm likes to have this quality in their employees that they are flexible enough to work in any condition. I don‚Äôt know whether this makes me different or not but it does give me an upper-hand amongst another candidates. (She was satisfied with my answer and gestured the other interviewer to question me) M1: Being an Electrical Engineer, your technical knowledge will not be used in case you are selected in marketing division. How do you justify that? V: It‚Äôs true that my technical knowledge will be of no use in marketing division but as an engineer, the analytical skills we develop during the 4 years will definitely help me there. M1: What do you know about the job profile in marketing division? V: As far as I know, in marketing division further there are different departments like aviation, LPG, retail sales, lubes and others. We could be assigned in any one of them. We will be asked to deal with the consumers. I said I wasn‚Äôt so sure. M1: What are the different divisions in IOCL? V: I answered 6 of them, forgot one. He told me that I missed Petrochemicals. M1: Have you ever visited a retail outlet? If yes, what are the things that are sold there? V: I told all of them (Then another member started) M2: What is Auto-Gas?

V: PROPEL M2: Okay, let‚Äôs start the technical part. (Me in my mind - Why!! This is going so good.. Why would you spoil it? Lol!!) Reason ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt studied anything technical since March, that‚Äôs why. M2: What is a relay? V: Answered M2: What happens when fault occurs and there is no protection ?

M1: What is it, RMS or average or peak value? V: RMS M1: What is definition of RMS? Why do we consider RMS and not Average value? V: Answered, wasn‚Äôt satisfactory enough. M1: What is Form Factor? Is F.F. infinite when Average value of sinusoidal wave is 0? V: I answered. Finally, M3 started. What a personality he had! He was the oldest in the room and was using his chair like a couch. M3: You said your weakness is Overthinking, tell us one instance where this affected you. V: I was prepared for this question and answered accordingly. M3: Okay, ‚ÄúHonesty is the best policy‚Äù. Justify it in 3 sentences. V: 1) I said about the feel good factor. 2) It's easy to say the truth.. when we lie .. in order to cover for it .. we need to continue lying.. 3) People will always come to you for an honest answer or review.. No further counter questions from his end. F1: Who is the Minister of Petroleum and Gas? V: Respected Dharmendra Pradhan F1: Finance Minister V: Respected Nirmala Sitharaman.. She is the first female finance minister of India. F1: IOCL also deals with jet fuel. Do you know what is it? V: Yes, mam.. ATF.. Aviation Turbine Fuel After this, they asked me to leave and conveyed their best. The whole interview took around 20 mins. By 2 p.m. it was over. Now the most important part .. LUNCH.. It was awesome. I was happy that I did not do any plunder in the interview like I did in ONGC. Although the technical part could have gone better. I might have forgotten some more questions.

I'm mediocre in studies as I got only 240 in the BITSAT 2023.","output":"Whether you should choose electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) or MSc in economics at BITS Pilani depends on your interests, aptitude, and career goals. EEE is a challenging but rewarding field. It offers a wide range of career options, including software development, hardware design, and embedded systems. If you are interested in technology and problem-solving, then EEE could be a good fit for you.MSc in economics is a more theoretical field. It offers a deeper understanding of economic principles and how they apply to the real world. If you are interested in business, finance, or public policy, then MSc in economics could be a good fit for you. Your BITSAT score of 240 is considered mediocre, but it is still within the range for admission to BITS Pilani. However, it is important to note that the competition for admission to EEE is very high. If you are not confident in your ability to succeed in EEE, then you may want to consider MSc in economics. Ultimately, the decision of which program to choose is up to you. Consider your interests, aptitude, and career goals carefully before making a decision. Here are some additional factors to consider when making your decision: Job prospects: Both EEE and MSc in economics offer good job prospects. However, the job market for EEE engineers is more competitive.Salary: The average salary for EEE engineers is higher than the average salary for economists.Work-life balance: EEE engineers typically have longer working hours than economists.Personal interest: Which field are you more interested in?

They ‚Äúdeflected‚Äù the damage.. to saturated fats (via Ancel Keys of Harvard). Now‚Ä¶the new ‚ÄúCarbohydrate-Insulin Model‚Äù of obesity states that rapid intake of sugar/fast-carbs triggers an insulin-alone surge‚Ä¶that sends ALL the sugar to fat cells‚Ä¶that are uniquely ‚Äúprimed‚Äù via excess omega 6 to be sensitive to insulin. Then it is stored‚Ä¶as fats via ‚Äúde novo‚Äù lipogenesis. That, in turn, causes EVERY metabolic disease system‚Ä¶and yes, circulating levels of free fats and triglycerides abounds. It DOES SEEM counterintuitive that excess sugar INCREASES bad lipids. Conversely‚Ä¶going ‚Äúlow-carb‚Äù to ‚Äúketo‚Äù‚Ä¶causes a reversion (takes a few days) to ‚Äúbeta-oxidation‚Äù, where mighty MITOCHONDRIA convert those fats‚Ä¶to useable energy‚Ä¶DECREASING circulating levels of lipids. But WAIT! I caution you about those ‚Äúlowfat‚Äù dairy products! In the mania about the dangers of saturated fats‚Ä¶the industry removes saturateds‚Ä¶then adds PALMITATE‚Ä¶for smoothness and texture‚Ä¶but PALMITATE debilitates MITOCHONDRIA via ‚Äúfission‚Äù-go figure! (That in turn debilitates YOUR beta-oxidation network-hello fibromyalgia). Now‚Ä¶just where was I? Oh yeah‚Ä¶about ARTIFICIAL sweeteners? Don't wait up for THAT to save you‚Ä¶you see, they trigger a ‚Äúdry-release‚Äù of insulin‚Ä¶which then causes a SUGAR CRASH (worse than with real sugar)‚Ä¶causing rampant hunger and sugar-cravings (repeat cycle and gain fat from overeating whatever). Now, about those sugar-cravings? They come from excessive omega 6 levels (in meat, fat-fried foods via vegetable oils), which begats Arachidonic Acid (that causes EVERY PMS symptom), which begats Anandamide‚Ä¶the very thing that drives YOUR sugar-craving BIG-TIME! Now‚Ä¶back to those FAT-CELLS you've been packing with blubber (via sugar and friends, recall)-a signaling molecule called leptin is SUPPOSED to tell excess fat cells‚Ä¶to DIE GRACEFULLY (when the control tower senses we've eaten enough?) But‚Ä¶sorry there too- excess omega 6 causes THICKENED CELL-WALLS‚Ä¶so fat cells just don't get the signal to stop‚Ä¶next stop? You need to be the BIGGEST LOSER, capiche? Ok now‚Ä¶enough with the horror-story. Well‚Ä¶one more bit first‚Ä¶meat producers like this just FINE as it is‚Ä¶they LOVE people overeating their omega 6 laden meats‚Ä¶they sell more meat that way. But I've solved this debacle‚Ä¶really I have‚Ä¶by rebalancing omega 9:6:3‚Ä¶to omega 9 excess‚Ä¶that produces a downchain chemistry‚Ä¶to an APPETITE-SUPPRESSANT that blocks said sugar, etc. cravings. This is EXTREMELY complex, of course‚Ä¶and I've tried to oversimplify for brevity‚Ä¶I could also delve DEEPER‚Ä¶into shifting fat storage to fat-burning (beige cells), but this question was only abiut SUGAR, recall."},{"instruction":"w can I get clients for my content writing business?","output":"To get clients for your content writing business, create a professional website showcasing your services and portfolio.

Where did this organic goo come from ? Secularism mocks Christianity for believing in a flying spaghetti monster, but it can conjure up organic goo at will to explain abiogenesis. That‚Äôs hypocrisy isn‚Äôt it ? You bet it is. Life is complicated. Anyone who tries to trivial life as a series of chemical reactions is clearly not fully versed in how biology works. Its worse than saying computers are a bunch of silicon thrown together. computers are more than just silicon. Computers have both hardware and software. No one would believe that over billions of years, computers evolved from calculators, which evolved from transistors which emerged from silicate goo. That would be silly right ? Well, life is far more complicated than computers. Life also has a hardware and software component. Proteins are the hardware, genes are the software. Both rely on each other, its a mutually inclusive system folks. In order for life to exist, we need genes and ATP. Genes are the instructions for building stuff. ATP is the energy source needed to drive all of this cellular work. Here is the paradox of life. Life needs information, which needs to be encoded into genes. Protein enzymes are needed to build the nucleotides, bring them together, and form stable bonds. But these protein enzymes also need genes. See the paradox ? In order to create these proteins we need ATP. ATP is manufactured by ATP synthase, another protein enzyme which needs a gene as well. Another paradox. This simplified explanation is what makes abiogenesis impossible without a supernatural causation, which is God. Follow this logic and you‚Äôll see why most intelligent atheists avoid any discussion about abiogenesis. All roads point to God.

It's important to note that there isn't a single, definitive answer to this question, as power and influence are distributed across a complex network of actors and institutions. Some common groups or entities that are often mentioned in discussions about global influence include: Governments and Political Leaders: Major world powers and their leaders play a significant role in shaping global policies, international relations, and economic systems.Corporations and Financial Institutions: Large multinational corporations, banks, and financial institutions wield substantial economic power and can influence policies and decisions through lobbying, investments, and market activities.International Organizations: Organizations like the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization have a role in shaping international policies and cooperation.Media and Communication Companies: Media conglomerates can shape public opinion, influence narratives, and impact culture, which can in turn influence global dynamics.Secret Societies and Conspiracy Theories: Some theories speculate about secret groups or societies that allegedly control world events from behind the scenes. These ideas often lack concrete evidence and are highly debated.Technology Companies: Tech giants have gained immense influence over communication, information dissemination, and technological innovation, impacting various aspects of society.Cultural and Academic Influencers: Intellectuals, artists, writers, and academics can shape cultural norms, values, and discussions that influence global perceptions and directions. It's important to approach discussions about who \\"runs the world\\" with critical thinking and skepticism. Power and influence are complex and often interconnected, and attributing everything to a single entity or group oversimplifies the intricate dynamics that shape our world.

Shortly after her husband passed away, she went to live in a care home. It was a wonderful place with kind and dedicated staff, chickens, and even a pair of chinchillas! Nan believed that she owned the place. She would ask how much the other residents were paying her, and regularly looked out at the garden, only to sigh and say ‚ÄúI don't know how I'm going to manage all that‚Äù. She'd also often comment that Bernie (my grandad) was waiting on hot coals for her to get home from work. Both the staff and us as a family agreed with everything she said. For her, moving to a care home wasn't frightening or overwhelming as it might have been. It almost seemed to give her a new lease of life, as she seemed to be imagining herself at a time when she felt happiest. Perhaps it is unethical to lie, but it's a far kinder alternative.

These nutrients provide sustained energy and help curb hunger cravings.Adequate portion sizes: Controlling portion sizes during meals is important for feeling satisfied. By consuming an appropriate amount of food during their main meals, individuals can avoid overeating and maintain a comfortable level of fullness until their next meal.Hydration: Staying well-hydrated can help manage hunger. Sometimes, feelings of hunger can actually be mistaken for thirst. By drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day, individuals can keep themselves hydrated and reduce the likelihood of unnecessary snacking between meals.Mindful eating: Being mindful and present while eating can enhance the satisfaction derived from meals. Paying attention to the flavors, textures, and enjoyment of food can make the eating experience more fulfilling, reducing the desire to eat more frequently.Balanced macronutrient distribution: Including a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in each meal can contribute to longer-lasting satiety. Protein, in particular, has been found to be highly satiating and can help individuals feel fuller for longer periods.Adaptation over time: The human body can adapt to different eating patterns. Over time, individuals who eat fewer meals may find that their bodies adjust and become accustomed to the chosen eating frequency, leading to reduced hunger between meals. It's important to note that individual experiences and preferences may vary. The ability to manage hunger between meals can depend on factors such as metabolism, activity levels, and overall health. Consulting a healthcare professional or registered dietitian can provide personalized guidance on optimizing meal frequency and managing hunger effectively."},{"instruction":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","output":"I will shove some philosophy here.

I'm not really even an avid bicycler - yet. I'll confess it's getting more difficult to be a Non-Driver as i get older. I've found a few things especially useful to have, know, or do: Choose your neighborhood wisely.Before you choose where you're going to live, be sure to check the place out thoroughly from the perspective of a Non-Driver: Will you have roommates, first of all, to help you get around sometimes? Where are the nearest PubTrans stops? Is there a grocery store / drugstore / convenience store / cafe / coffee shop / whatever within walking distance? Biking distance? Are you OK with living on a hill? Is the area safe for people to walk around at night? Would you feel OK locking up your bike outside while shopping (etc) in the area? There are lots of important questions to ask yourself when choosing a new place, as a person who doesn't drive. It's a lot easier if you live with roommates who drive.This is true anywhere if you don't drive - you can combine errands like grocery shopping with other people, eliminating awkward and frequent runs on PubTrans or a bike. Get friendly with local maps - including specialized ones - like the useful Bike Maps that show the hills, and MUNI / ACTransit / BART route maps.If you didn't already know that certain sequences of streets in SF are named in mostly-alphabetical order (Anza, Balboa, Cabrillo...), this is just one of the many useful little things about the Bay that you can pick up from spending time with a local map. Also, you can probably never hope to understand the way roads converge and diverge in the East Bay without seeing it on a large scale. Whether you are walking, biking, taking buses, or driving - you really should have at least one good map of the entire Bay Area. Try hanging one up in the bathroom where you can leisurely contemplate it - this worked wonders for one house i used to live in. Own at least one bicycle, and know a place to get it serviced quickly near your home (or be able to DIY).I've been using a basic adult tricycle i bought online to get around mostly-flat Oakland, and it's been especially practical for leisurely cruises to the local farmer's markets. If you live in the City, you'll probably want something sleeker and with gears. Also, consider that you will probably want a bike option that can be carried on BART (Bikes on BART guide: http://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/index.aspx). Whatever you choose, you either need to know how to fix it yourself, or have a reliable local shop in mind for when the inevitable bash-up occurs. Don't forget to wear a helmet and use a solid lock. Go ahead - Take a taxi.Sometimes it seems expensive to take a taxi home to the East Bay from SF after a long night, but consider the alternatives: Assuming you can drive and have a car - drive yourself, pay a bridge toll, pay for gas, stay sober, and find parking. Oh, and make sure not to leave any valuables anywhere in sight.BART-a-rella: Head home before the stroke of midnight! (http://www.bart.gov/guide/latenight.aspx)Assuming you're willing to spend whatever's left of your night getting home, take the all-nighter 800 bus. (http://transit.511.org/accessible/providers/night.aspx) A taxi will cost in the range of 30-50 (plus tip) from downtown, SOMA, or the Mission to most of Oakland and south Berkeley, in my experience. There are also new services coming out with apps for your phone that let you pay variable rates for a hired car pickup. (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/technology/uber-a-car-service-smartphone-app-plans-cheaper-service.html) After talking to friends who own cars and deal with driving them (especially across the bridge for a night out), it seems that ownership carries more expense and responsibility than the occasional taxi ride, by far. Plan efficiently - Do all your errands at once.If you are used to having a car, you may be used to running to the store every time you need this or that for dinner or whatever, but when you don't drive, you learn to think differently. Know what shops are in close proximity to eachother and to the PubTrans stops you prefer. Sometimes it's easier for me to pick something up in SF than Oakland because a store is more accessible to a BART stop over there, or vice-versa. Also, if you know you're going to need a taxi (or a friend driver) to help carry all those bags, make a good list and hit all the stops while you're out. Online Shopping is your friend.When you don't drive, it can be really nice to have things shipped to your door, especially when you know exactly what you want. Think bulk groceries, toiletries you always use, cleaning supplies, pet food, etc. In general, I believe it can be done! And happily.I've been living without driving in the Bay Area, happily, on and off for over 10 years - with a little help from my friends and what i consider to be an above-average PubTrans system. Your mileage may vary..."},{"instruction":"What are the best baby skin care products?","output":"There are so many newborn baby brands in the market that it's difficult to choose. Also, each baby has a different type of skin and they react differently to different products. While my child responded very well to the tummy roll on by Mamaearth, she got very bad skin rashes from the Mamaearth lotion. I like Cetaphil and Mothercare also, but sometimes I don't get a good deal online or products aren't available. Recently I have been trying some products from a natural product brand called Citta, and I'm really happy with their entire range. They have a shampoo, body wash, oil, powder and balm, and all of these have been very useful in my baby's newborn phase. The Citta oil is amazing, very light for massaging and non-sticky. Similar for the balm- deep hydration especially in this dry winter, but not sticky like other body butters etc. The brand is making all products without toxins, parabens, allergens, sulphates and all the other bad chemicals as well.

These gases trap heat and cause the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to a range of impacts such as more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification, among others. The scientific consensus is clear that climate change is happening, and that it is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, has concluded that it is very likely that human activities are responsible for the observed warming of the Earth's climate since the mid-20th century. To address [LINKED_TEXT: climate change] [URL: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr531-PPMQP/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA], it is crucial that we take immediate and ambitious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to a low-carbon economy, and adapt to the changes that are already happening. This requires a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments around the world to prioritize sustainable practices and work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Investing money is a great way to make your money work for you and potentially grow over time. Here are some of the best [LINKED_TEXT: investing options] [URL: https://binaryfinance.net/types-of-investment-options-available/] to invest your money: Saving Account: A simple and safe way to start is by opening a savings account at a bank. This allows you to deposit your money and earn some interest over time. While the returns may not be significant, it's a good place to begin building your savings.Fixed Deposits: Another safe option is to invest in fixed deposits (FD) offered by banks. In an FD, you deposit a specific amount for a fixed period, and the bank pays you interest on that amount. It's a low-risk investment option, and the longer you keep your money invested, the higher the interest you'll earn.[LINKED_TEXT: Public Provident Fund (PPF)] [URL: https://cleartax.in/s/ppf]: PPF is a government-backed investment scheme in which you can deposit a certain amount each year. It offers a higher interest rate than regular savings accounts and provides tax benefits. However, the money you invest in PPF has a lock-in period, meaning you can't withdraw it for a specific number of years.Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from different investors and invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on your behalf. Mutual funds can offer higher returns, but they also come with some risk. It's important to choose funds that match your investment goals and risk tolerance.Stock Market: Investing in stocks means buying shares of a company and becoming a partial owner. While the stock market can be volatile and risky, it also offers the potential for high returns. As a beginner, it's advisable to start with the help of a financial advisor or use online platforms that provide guidance for investing in stocks.Real Estate: Investing in real estate involves buying properties like houses or apartments with the intention of generating income through rental payments or capital appreciation (increase in property value over time). Real estate can be a long-term investment option, and it requires careful research and planning. Remember, investing involves risks, and it's important to do thorough research and seek advice from professionals before making any investment decisions. Start with small amounts, learn about different investment options, and gradually increase your investment as you gain more knowledge and experience. Patience and a long-term perspective are key to successful investing."},{"instruction":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient that they‚Äôre vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they‚Äôre in a care facility‚Äîassuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","output":"It is perfectly ethical to tell a dementia sufferer whatever will make them feel most comfortable.

Abdul Kalam to enable India attain self-sufficiency in the field of missile technology. It was approved by the Government of India in 1983 and completed in March 2012.The 5 missiles (P-A-T-N-A) developed under this program are:Prithvi: Short range surface to surface ballistic missile.Agni: Ballistic missiles with different ranges, i.e. Agni (1,2,3,4,5)Trishul: Short range low level surface to air missile.Nag: 3rd generation anti-tank missile.Akash: Medium range surface to air missile. Canister Based Launch System Canister based launch system- serves as a container for transportation; a housing during storage aboard a vessel; provides operational flexibility.A canister launch system can be either hot launch, where the missile ignites in the cell, or cold launch, where the missile is expelled by gas produced by a gas generator which is not part of the missile itself, and then the missile ignites.Cold launch is safer than hot launch as the ejection system will eject the missile by itself even if there is a missile failure. In case of Agni V, it will be a cold launch.In case of hot launches, the problem is the heat produced by the missile at the time of launch. The hot launch is better for small missiles as the ejection part itself will be done by using the missile's own engine."},{"instruction":"What is the forecast of the smart building market?","output":"This report studies the global [LINKED_TEXT: Smart Building market] [URL: https://www.radiantinsights.com/research/global-smart-building-market-size-status-and-forecast-2025/request-sample?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=AnnesaS_17June19], analyzes and researches the Smart Building development status and forecast in United States, EU, Japan, China, India and Southeast Asia.

Docks are well surveyed and GPS fixes can be made when the antennas are above water. Active Sonar is not used while submerged is not used for stealth reasons, plus you cannot use the relatively short range of radar to find yourself in a global setting. Subs have very precise inertial navigation systems. They use precision spinning gyroscopes to measure 2-D acceleration of the vessels as it speeds up and slows down. Numerical integration and double integration of the acceleration data will provide speed and distance values which can be plotted to get a relatively accurate position on the earth. While depth is easily ascertained by pressure reading. Errors in measuring acceleration when integrated will add up to progressively larger distance errors with time.

The entire movie takes place over the course of a few days. Steppenwolf appeared right in Amazon territory and tore through them. Left them in shambles while their most powerful warrior, Wonder Woman, was thousand of miles away. Next he hit Atlantis. No real warning, they had no prep time, he showed up, took their Mother Box, and left. He did this with only a couple skirmishes with the Atlanteans and Aquaman himself. With Steppy‚Äôs abilities to teleport in, wreck ‚Äòem, and teleport away, and within their timeframe, the League had no real way to gather the Amazons, Atlanteans (given Arthur‚Äôs game of thrones), and the multitudes of the armies of Man. Even if they had, they had no specific battlefield to send them to until they found out Steppy took over that little village - which by then there was no time to send an army, they needed a rapid response team, which was the League themselves. And finally, the League estimated they had the power to win. Bringing in armies of frail Earthlings would‚Äôve been a hindrance to the League, with arrows and spears and rockets being fired all around them while they‚Äôre trying to take on Steppenwolf in close quarters. So, in short, Steppenwolf‚Äôs attack was too rapid to try to take the time to unite Earth into one force. There were no generals or lieutenants, just Steppenwolf himself and a bunch of parademons. Since Steppenwolf was the only real target, a small but superpowered response team was sufficient. Ready for a huge plot hole though? If push came to shove, Cyborg could‚Äôve AT ANY TIME highjacked a nuclear weapons arsenal and fired at Steppenwolf‚Äôs lair. He‚Äôd have killed a few civilians, but it would‚Äôve ended the threat.

Not pulling your leg. If you know the culture of cruise ships, particularly in the United States, you know how impossible this feat can seem. Here were some of the keys to how I lost 5 pounds on 10-day cruise from Miami to the Caribbean in March 2023 while eating almost anything I wanted: Mindset:There‚Äôs a difference between eating anything you want and everything you want, a main distinction being many of us can eat almost anything in a healthy sort of way so long as we don‚Äôt eat too much of it.Loosey-goosey, no pressure, no compelling reason for doing this other than being a nut job, as this was just an experiment (was already in pretty good shape going into the trip, so losing weight could‚Äôve been made harder because of this); I could have changed my mind and started eating the world at any moment.Going into this cruise, I thought a couple of the main lever points to accomplishing this goal would be to continue with intermittent fasting and doing more cardio (another incentive to doing extra cardio is that it might help me sleep better at night). Exercise:Performed about an hour of cardio daily in the cruise gym (do about 2‚Äì3 hours of cardio weekly in real life) ‚Äî alternated days between jogging in a treadmill and stationary bike. Doing almost exclusively cardio (did a bit of strength training) wasn‚Äôt the intention going in, but it‚Äôs what felt most comfortable for me in the gym social-distancing-wise, after not having been to a gym in 3-years since COVID started.Lots of walking ‚Äî always took the stairs on the cruise ship when I was either alone or with folks who didn‚Äôt mind the stairs (6‚Äì7 flights of stairs to get food, water, and go to the gym), and then there‚Äôs the usual walking one does when exploring a country or while on a cruise vacation generally. Nutrition:As mentioned above, did intermittent fasting. Mostly, ate a snack around 1 PM (usually some mixed nuts and an organic-type protein bar) and a sizable dinner with dessert around 7 PM, with few exceptions such a late-night pizza binge.Portion control. We were lucky on this front in that perhaps in an attempt to save money after having struggled financially during COVID and the seemingly impending economic recession, food portions in the restaurants of the cruise ship (where we ate dinner each night) were smallish, which allowed me to get away with ordering two entrees on most nights (was burning lots of calories and was starving), and we‚Äôd go up to the buffet area to finish things off if the restaurant‚Äôs food wasn‚Äôt ideal.Didn‚Äôt drink any alcohol or soda.Drank about 90 ounces of water per day.Tried consuming ample veggies and whole foods during each meal.Some of the indulgences I had included:two ice cream cones (had to try both the plain vanilla and mixed vanilla/chocolate)pizza on two ocassions (ate the equivalent of about three large slices during each session)desserts (the plan was to split dessert with someone else, but didn‚Äôt have to do this since portions were fairly small): blueberry cobbler, tres leches on two occasions, Boston cream pie, peanut-caramel bar, crumbly oat and berry bar, strawberry shortcake, coconut layer cake, and perhaps one or two others I‚Äôm forgetting.Miscellaneous: ate fish and chips for dinner once and tried a fried appetizer here and there in moderation. In conclusion, if you don‚Äôt want to gain weight on a cruise or perhaps wouldn‚Äôt mind losing a pound or two and yet still want to enjoy food, with a few tweaks here and there, it‚Äôs possible."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"After several months of chit chatting and irritatingly awkward discussions, one day, a text message popped up on his WhatsApp. She: I love irritating you, and I will keep doing that till we graduate.

See how the second note comes from the octave above? That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called the 9th chord instead of the second."},{"instruction":"f I proved th","output":"You can't.

One of the difficulties of forge welding, however, is to keep oxygen away from the pieces so that you don‚Äôt have scale (oxidized metal) in the middle of the weld, thus weakening it because the metal can‚Äôt fuse through the scale. To avoid that, blacksmiths use borax (20 Mule Team Borax from your grocery aisle works) either straight, dried extremely, or with assorted additives. This material melts over the metal in the forge, excluding air. There‚Äôs a guy who forge welds without the borax, but I haven‚Äôt had the time to study how he does it- I suspect by controlling his fire. Basic forge welding takes practice, because if you heat the metal too hot, it burns up just like a piece of wood, and if it‚Äôs not hot enough, it won‚Äôt weld. It can be pretty difficult to do. We often joke that not only do you have to have all the usual conditions right, but you have to hop twice on your left foot, and three times on your right foot, be wearing your lucky T-shirt, and pray a lot :) A lot of things can interfere with a proper forge weld, including ‚Äúpoisoning‚Äù your fire, in other words allowing non- iron metals into your forge without cleaning it thoroughly. I suspect the ambient humidity may have something to do with it, too, because some days you can‚Äôt forge weld to save your life, and some days you can weld without a problem. A friend of mine, Master Oso, one of the best bladesmiths in the world, was teaching a class in forge welding one day, and the welding was going well. One of his students was trying to get his attention. ‚ÄúMaster Oso?‚Äù Oso ignored him, went on with what he was doing. ‚ÄúBut, Master Oso?‚Äù Ignored him again. ‚ÄúMaster Oso!!!‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother my right now, I‚Äôm busy!‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Master Oso, your pants are on fire!!!‚Äù ‚ÄúWell put it out- I‚Äôm busy!‚Äù Forge welding requires quite a bit of concentration."},{"instruction":"What are the most amazing photos you have ever taken?","output":"Clouds over NZ.

It is better to write a stupid page than nothing. The thing I most want to stress is that different writers‚Äô brains need different things.

If you abandon too many novels, you'll become well-practised in writing beginnings, ok at middles and terrible at endings. If you want to write, you need to be curious. You have to eavesdrop and be nosy, explore new roads, and open closed doors. You have to be a magpie, and build your stories from the treasures you find and steal.

Guys this is it for Most Efficient way to prepare for GATE Exam. If you have any queries/questions. Feel free to ask them in the comments section below. And we will be glad to answer them for you. Before Exam---------------------1. Understand that you cannot get 100 marks in GATE :) I think even 90 is a tough ask. Toppers answer around 85-90 marks (of course it depends on the paper's difficulty, but the general trend is this). 2. NEVER OMIT ANY subject. I find most students omit a subject based on the weightage. The problem with this approach is often it happens that the subject you omit will have some really easy questions and the subject you prepare well has much harder problems to solve. 3. Self-study works, but I would suggest joining a coaching institute. I didn't have good faculty for some subjects in my under-graduate program and I was amazed at how well I can understand a concept when taught by a really competent faculty. 4. Maths will make a huge difference in your scores. Around 30 marks (including aptitude) is really easy to score. They are usually less difficult and direct than subject questions. 5. Solve as many previous year GATE problems as you can. 6. Learn concepts only from standard books that was prescribed for your under-graduate program. Notes, ppts may not give you complete knowledge. 7. Use standard books. 8. Solve 10‚Äì15 Questions Daily. 9. use standard books. During Exam--------------------1. If you are not sure about an answer,LEAVE it. Negatives cost a lot. 2. Don't compare marks of previous years and answer questions. For ex., in CS 2012, for a score of 60, AIR was around #500, but in CS 2013, for a score of 60, AIR is around #50. You might end up scoring more negatives trying to match previous year's scores. This requires you to judge the paper's difficulty, which is possible only if you had prepared all subjects. 3. Having a strong clear mind throughout the exam is absolutely necessary. Question papers usually contain the most difficult questions up front to dent your confidence. Easy questions get mixed up at the later part. So keep moving on even if you had to leave 5 questions on the trot. 4. Solve aptitude section first. 5. Solve Easy Question first then shift to hard one. Preparation Technique------------------------------------There is no ideal strategy for GATE preparation. As long as you cover all the topics, any strategy should work. I had around 4 months full time (from October mid) for preparation. 1. I allotted a week for each subject. This includes studying all the topics, going through standard book back questions, coaching institute material exercises. I had sorted the subjects into a 12 week schedule (3 months). 2. I had another month to revise everything, take Test Series and go through the GATE previous year questions. So in all it was a 4-month preparation. 3. If you are really talented and in constant touch with your subject basics, I would suggest a month preparation. If you are an above-average/average student, it is best to give 3-4 months preparation. 4. Too many cooks spoil the broth. Stop searching for preparation tips too much and start preparing! 5. Don‚Äôt panic. I am going to share some strategies to crack GATE exam. PREPARATION STRATEGY:- Many student want to know that how to get good rank in gate exam.

Although the above definition is completely correct, there is much more to the full meaning of climate change and why it is important in our society today. Some essential perspectives based on which you can form a good opinion (or thought, in line with your question) on Climate Change and its importance, include; 1). Climate Change in relation to Weather Variation 2). Climate Change as an Act 3). Climate Change as a Process 4). Climate Change in relation to Global Warming 5). Climate Change in relation to the Greenhouse Effect 6). Climate Change in relation to Ozone Layer Depletion 7). Climate Change as a Movement Kindly see details at source: [LINKED_TEXT: What is Climate Change and Why is it Important? 7 Essential Ways to Define and Understand Climate Change] [URL: https://www.felsics.com/what-is-climate-change-and-why-is-it-important-7-essential-ways-to-define-and-understand-climate-change/] For example, when we choose to understand Climate Change in terms of its relation to Weather Variation, we must view it as a phenomenon involving processes (like Greenhouse Gas Emission and Global Warming) that affect the elements of weather such as temperature, air pressure, wind and ocean current dynamics, and solar radiation. By affecting these elements, climate change becomes an ultimate outcome of weather variations in general. Climate change as an act, can give us the understanding that it is the result of different natural and human-induced processes, all of which are driven by a causative force, such as industrialization, transport, mining and drilling, among others. Climate Change as a process involves an overview of the sequence of events which can contribute to climate Change, and the required conditions under which it may occur. Such events include Global Warming, The Greenhouse Effect, and Ozone Layer Depletion, each of which can provide us with an understanding of climate change. Climate Change can also be understood in terms of the corporate efforts made by international and regional agencies in support of the movement to address the numerous problems accompanying the changing climate around the world. These perspectives are all very relevant to help understand climate change. However, the definition given at the beginning of this post is sufficient to provide a basic understanding of the concept."},{"instruction":"Do you think the Kardashians deserve what they have?","output":"Why not, the audience they‚Äôve derived from the low grade moron pool is obvious, but I hold no grudge on their success, and I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt either .

This is no longer true. Today, the performance is replaced by 360 degree propaganda. Media, which used to be eyes and ears of people, is interested in showing what BJP wants people to see. Not to mention the direct influence of IT cells on social media. In fact, a lot of news outlets just pick up memes, rhetoric and propaganda from social media and turn it into readable news for public consumption. Winning Elections: As of today, you need three things to win elections. MoneyPropagandaReligion BJP has truckloads of money to fight elections because it is not corrupt (wink, wink). It is light years ahead of all opponents in propaganda. And BJP literally and figuratively owns religion. None of the Above : AAP has none of the above. Yes, it has been a good performer but that's not important anymore. It is simply a matter of perception. For instance, if an AAP MLAs slaps (not proven yet) an officer, the entire gang (Central Government, Police, IAS lobby, Media and Social media) demands Kejriwal‚Äôs head on a platter. They make sure that every living and breathing soul in India knows that AAP is unruly. On the other hand, if Manoj Tiwari slaps an IPS officer (captured on camera), they simply look the other way. In fact, some of them, make it look like an act of self-defense. The most sophisticated part of this proproganda is the IT cell guys masquerading as social influencers. They make an argument which goes like this: We don't like Pradya Thakur, Manoj Tiwari, Bla, Bla, Bla‚Ä¶but Modiji is so good. Vote for him. They are happy to induct criminals into the parliament to fullfil their desire for hero worshipping. Freebies. Is it? AAP is putting taxpayers money in public welfare. They can afford to make it free because they don't scam the money away. They have no business cronies to award contracts to and don't expect bucket loads of kickbacks in form of anonymous party donations. Yet, they are made to look like national criminals. That‚Äôs the power of top class propaganda. I might not agree with them all the time. But I don't expect them to play martyrs anymore. Of course, a line has to be drawn. If they start to indulge in corruption and bigotry, as far as I am concerned they are over and so is any hope for people‚Äôs power. In conclusion, AAP is offering public welfare at a cost to taxpayers. In decent language, it is called socialism. Freebies are about distrusting money, alcohol, objects and pleasure to buy votes. Subsidizing the cost of essential services for poor section of people is a welfare scheme. However, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all when it is called as freebies, because today we live in India where father of the nation is referred as a traitor. Nothing tops that. In fact, the bottom has broken down already. We are in free fall.

Here‚Äôs Sasha at work - and Velvet and Peach also get in on the act - Sasha was an environmentalist who believed that it was important to regularly check the quality of water entering our home - and following her death that job has been quite adequately performed by Peach - Our cats have always believed it was important to check under beds, behind dressers and in corners to hunt dust bunnies, although none of them have liked vacuuming. Guarding the house or cottage by watching for suspicious trespassers is something they quite enjoy. Our cats love the kitchen and, while none have ever learned to cook, they do like to taste test some human food, especially fish, chicken, and turkey. Velvet, in particular, enjoys helping with the dishes by making certain that no food scraps remain. Peach also does dishes While entertainment isn‚Äôt really a household ‚Äúchore‚Äù the cats feel it helpful to assist. Sasha liked to be a bit of a clown - while Velvet likes to read the newspaper - and Peach plays such sports as catch-a-mouse or swat-the-ball - When presents come it is necessary to unwrap them - and Peach is considering learning the skill. Velvet has always enjoyed helping put up the Christmas tree and Sasha was good at guarding the presents while Peach likes to assist with decorations - When it‚Äôs time to pack up to travel you can be sure Velvet will be helping to pack boxes and Peach will make sure that we don‚Äôt leave anything out of the suitcases - And after all that is done it‚Äôs time to go back to mattress testing again Normally I write Quora articles about cats and prefer to write about cats.

XRP is a cryptocurrency that is used on the Ripple network for cross-border payments and remittances. The fee and TPS (transactions per second) for XRP depend on several factors. First, the XRP network has a fixed transaction cost of 0.00001 XRP per transaction, which is significantly lower than the transaction fees of other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This makes XRP transactions very cost-effective, particularly for cross-border payments.Second, XRP is designed to have high TPS capacity, with the ability to process up to 1,500 transactions per second. This is due to the unique consensus algorithm used by the Ripple network, which is designed to be fast and efficient. However, the actual TPS and fee for XRP transactions may vary depending on network congestion, the amount of XRP being transferred, and other factors. In general, XRP is known for its fast transaction times and low fees, which make it an attractive option for those looking to make cross-border payments or remittances. You can always buy XRP on trusted platforms like Bybit Exchange, Binance and MEXC Global. I fancy MEXC Global the most due to their responsive 24/7 Customer Service team, low trading fees and friendly user interface.

Do they always have to watch their cars when parked in public to not get scratched/damaged by someone?","output":"There are a few models of the Porsche 911 which are optimized for track use - the GT2 (and the GT3) which aren‚Äôt mean to be driven regularly or even on most roads. They have atrocious ground clearance and some models (I don‚Äôt recall which) lack the basic creature comforts like A/C or heat. Those aren‚Äôt meant to be driven on the road, and I‚Äôm sure that the people who buy them have a half-dozen or more cars, and may not even license these cars for on-road use because they are actual on-track racers. But all other models of Porsche and all models of Audi are intended to be used regularly. They are just high-end luxurious cars, and more practical than true ‚Äúexotics‚Äù. A Ferrari and a Lamborghini are true exotics - the thing is that they are rarely driven at more than 7/8 of their capability, but they lack the practicality for daily use. Some models of Ferrari have custom-designed luggage that fits its limited interior space exactly, but these cars are difficult for more than a weekend away. They do work well for short drives and going to work, but people will realize quickly that they do limit what you can do with them. Drive-thrus, busy parking lots, and speed bumps will cause you grief. Carrying more than a briefcase is difficult, but when I visited some high-end places in California, there were plenty of people driving their exotics to work or for dinner, but not to go shopping. Even the peerless Ferrari 456 - a 2+2 coupe with a front-mounted V12 and 4 seats - was not a daily driver."},{"instruction":"Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?","output":"Because this is the base of cryptography. For a good encryption - you need to search through a larger space of searching until you finally reach to the private key/s of the encryption - for the average case. And it‚Äôs very easy to make a good encryption. I‚Äôll give you a small number example. Take two (different) big prime numbers and multiply them with each other - that is the core of RSA encryption. It is very easy to do so, and to remember your private keys - the 2 big primes you multiplied with each other. But for every body else, if they haven‚Äôt a big Quantum Computer with enough Qubits that can easily crack this RSA number - and if they haven‚Äôt found a proof that Factorization is in P via a polynomial algorithm which is also efficient enough with no too big exponent for its polynomial algorithm - then it would be very hard to crack this RSA number. For example: 263,838,266,369 ‚Ä¢ 736,926,836,249 = 194,429,498,916,728,106,809,881. This is an example for an RSA number that is of course a multiplication of two primes; easy very much to find two primes like those and multiply them with each other, and very easy also to find their product; but if I only gave you the RSA number 194,429,498,916,728,106,809,881 and asked you to factorize it to its prime factors - even if I told how many primes combine this number - which in this case is two different primes - it would still be very much hard to factorize this number and practically crack into its prime factors. For the Factorization problem is suspected, still, to be a problem in NP-intermediate class of complexity."},{"instruction":"w does the earning potential of YouTube compare to other social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok?","output":"You can Actually get Paid if you Join there Partnership Program the other Social Media Sites don't have anything like that"},{"instruction":"Can two different versions of Adobe Photoshop be installed in PC?","output":"Yes, it is possible to install and run two different versions of Adobe Photoshop on a PC.

Before I start writing, let's get some things sorted first. Mumbai is not my birthplace nor do I live in Mumbai. I have only been to Mumbai about three times. I don‚Äôt know whether that makes me a suitable candidate to answer the query, but nevertheless I would like to pen something about the city which is very close to my heart. The city has a soul, a beating heart beneath the sprawling metropolis of the concrete jungle. In the hullaballoo of today‚Äôs materialistic world, we often forget the ethos of living, the very simplistic of things that we neglect happening around us, often turn out to be the ones that remind us how to live. I would state a few of the occasions that made me fall in love with the city. The Stranger It happened during my first visit to the place. My mum, my aunt and I went to visit Sidhhi Vinayak and after that, we were not able to find any cabs to reach our destination. We were standing there for about an hour and nothing came our way. Suddenly out of the blue, a cab ( the Kaali-Peeli one, it was before the time of Ubers and Olas ) screeched its brakes in front of us and came to a halt. A stranger popped his cheerful head out of the window and asked us ‚ÄúWhere are you guys heading?‚Äù We told him our destination and he offered to take us there. We were a bit skeptical of boarding the cab with a stranger but somehow we agreed to board the cab. Maybe his friendliness was all we were banking upon. Sounds like a boring story, right? But here is what amazed me. The guy got down after almost 30 minutes into the journey, and our drop was still afar. He then took out a wad of notes and asked the driver the fare for our destination. We protested vehemently that we would pay the fare, and that he already has done a lot for us. But the man refused to make money, he paid the fare and said that ‚ÄúYou are our guests, you are new to this city, consider this a bit of city tour from my end‚Äù and then he vanished amidst the city roads before we could bid a proper goodbye. The Coca Cola Mumbai has a plethora of shopping complexes and malls. Well, how can one miss those? We went to Inorbit Mall Goregaon and being a foodie, I headed straight to the Food Court. I went to the KFC counter and bought some things I don‚Äôt remember now. After that, I asked the person at the counter to get me water. He told me ‚Äú Sorry Sir we have run out of water. I am extremely sorry. Here have this instead‚Äù Do you want to know what ‚ÄúThis‚Äù was? ‚ÄúThis‚Äù was a litre of Coca-Cola handed over to me. I asked ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù All he replied was that ‚ÄúSir, Please take this as a token of our apology for our inability to provide you water‚Äù. I tried to persuade him to take the money but he kept on refusing. These ephemeral moments of genuine pure humanity have made me love the city more and more. The Chaiwala ( Well not Mr. Modi ) Well, this one is a bit surreal. We were in Bandstand, sitting by the sea looking at the intimidating Arabian Sea, ( after a lot of photo sessions have been done in front of King Khan‚Äôs Residence Mannat ) chatting in ‚ÄúBengali‚Äù when someone asked us ‚ÄúChaa khaben? ( It‚Äôs Bengali for ‚ÄúWill you guys have tea? ‚Äú ) .We were a bit taken aback at hearing the familiar statement we are used to hearing back home. Then we saw him the Chai-wala.. He told us that he is from Naihati, a place in West Bengal, We talked about a lot of things that day, his struggles, his family, his kids, his life. Fast forward 4 years, there I was back at Band-Stand and there I could see the same guy. His clothes were torn, but his swag had not diminished a bit. When I asked him to pose for the photo, he did that with a finesse very few will ever be able to emulate. Life has not been kind to him, but his resolve, his determination to see it through, his sheer willingness to embrace life awed us, made us salute that man. These small but countless experiences are what made me love the city from the bottom of my heart. Mumbai is not just about the buildings, the food, the vada pavs, the glitzy nightlife, the seas, the metropolis, the skyline as many claim to be. It‚Äôs about the people, not just the people who are born here, but the people who have come from the various parts of the country to fulfill their dreams, everyone who has lived here or has come here even for a brief stint, will acknowledge that the city cares for them all. From childhood, we are taught that India is a land of bio-diversity, a land where people of different religions, caste, creed, gender and orientations co-exist happily together. Well, I found all those values of ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù in a place called Mumbai. :) This is the first time I am writing something big. Please bear with my mistakes.

Make sure to use a heat-resistant glass bowl, such as borosilicate glass, that is specifically labeled as oven-safe. Regular glass bowls may shatter or crack under high temperatures, so it's essential to use the appropriate type of glass.Adjust the baking time and temperature: Glass conducts heat differently than metal baking pans, so you may need to adjust the baking time and temperature. In general, you can lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 degrees Celsius) and expect the cake to take a bit longer to bake. Keep a close eye on the cake during baking to prevent overcooking.Grease and flour the glass bowl: Just as you would with a regular baking pan, make sure to grease the inside of the glass bowl and dust it with flour. This will help prevent the cake from sticking to the sides and bottom.Use the right size of the glass bowl: Ensure that the glass bowl you use is appropriate for the cake recipe you're making. If the bowl is too small, the cake may overflow during baking. If it's too large, the cake may not rise properly.Consider the shape: Glass bowls may have a different shape compared to traditional baking pans. The shape of the bowl can affect how the cake bakes and rises, so keep this in mind when choosing your recipe.Avoid drastic temperature changes: When using glass in the oven, it's essential to avoid drastic temperature changes. For example, don't place a cold glass bowl directly into a preheated oven, as this can cause it to crack. Instead, let the bowl come to room temperature first. If you follow these guidelines, you can successfully bake a cake in a glass bowl. However, if you're unsure about the specific bowl you have or the recipe you want to use, it's always a good idea to consult the manufacturer's guidelines or use a traditional metal baking pan to be safe.

Upon arriving at Mustafar, Vader finished off the Separatist Leaders and ensured that the Droid Armies wouldn't ever be activated again. In Canon, this remains the case and the Trade Federation's army was never reestablished. In Legend Canon, there was a bit more to the story behind it. In Star Wars Battlefront II on the PS2, PC and Xbox, there is a campaign mission on Mustafar where a former Separatist leader emerges from hiding and activates the Droid Armies to try and challenge the Empire. He damn well nearly succeeded to, had he been able to capture an Imperial Star Destroyer he sent his marines to invade.

Angular vs. AngularJS - Comparison Chart 1. Architecture Angular JS: This framework supports MVC design. Angular: It works with components and directives. 2. Command Line Interface (CLI) Angular JS: This framework depends on third party CLIs because it doesn't have its own. Angular: It has its own CLI that helps it to get the component's services and directives quickly. It comes with a set of commands that are quite convenient to build your projects using the framework. 3. Language Angular JS: It is a framework written in JavaScript language, and uses HTML templates. Angular: Written in a TypeScript language, which happens to be a superset of JavaScript, ECMAScript 6 (es6), improves its performance. 4. Routing Angular JS: For routing configuration, the framework uses () Angular: It uses @Route configuration that looks like this; {()} 5. Structure Management Angular JS: The structure of this framework is less manageable when you compare it with Angular. However, it handles the small applications well. Angular: It has a better structure that helps to create or manage larger applications. 6. Dependency Injection Angular JS: In this framework, DI gets injected into directive definitions, controller functions, and others. Angular: It uses Hierarchical Dependency Injections with declarations, providers, and constructor functions. It helps to boost your app performance. 7. Mobile Support Angular JS: The framework does not have mobile support. Angular: It has all popular mobile browser support. 8. Performance Angular JS: The two-way-binding process keeps checking for scope variable, using the digest cycle. The checking may take long, causing the application performance. Angular: Being a rewrite of AngularJS, Angular is faster and efficient. Its flux architecture makes applications run faster. Angular Features Supports data bindingIt has an MVWIt comes with an inbuilt template engineIt supports hierarchical Dependency Injection.It is a highly scalable framework since it's modern and faster.If you are still trying to figure out which is better than the other, the pros and cons of Angular vs. AngularJS might be helpful. Angular: Pros Due to its component-based architecture and better data binding algorithm, Angular has faster performance.The independent components that this framework uses gets easily replaced or maintained.The inbuilt extensions in Angular's server-side allow the developers to sync both front and backside of content.The use of TypeScript language results in cleaner code, improved navigation, and top-quality products.Applications in the Angular framework can also work on mobile devices and browsers.Since Angular's components are independent, they are test-friendly and reusable. Angular: Cons As most developers are not conversant with TypeScript, they find it to have a steep learning curve.The management of Angular's components is quite complicated.Although most engineers appreciate the command-line interface, they do complain that the documentation is incomplete. Angular JS: Pros JavaScript, which is the language used in this framework, makes it easier for developers to learn the structure.AngularJS architecture of MVC and MVVM separates the design and data, making the complex web development more straightforward.Organized coding makes the framework's codes reusable.There is faster coding support and prototyping in AngularJS, which results in improved development time. Angular JS: Cons A developer who is not familiar with an MVC architecture, cannot use this framework.A developer can only use the system with JavaScript; if it gets disabled, it cannot run.The DI feature and directives can get complicated to a developer used to traditional methods. One spends a lot of time learning or ends hiring someone knowledgeable.If you are new in the framework, you will find the scopes debugging to be quite complicated.

For a naysayer to fast-food and harmful food packaging, it couldn‚Äôt get better than this. 2.Daily Local Train: A public transport system could make an entire city thrive & survive with resilience If the Dabbawala keeps his promise to get fresh food straight from your kitchen to your desk, much of it is owing to the Mumbai Suburban Railways or the local train system that supports this food supply chain. With around 2300 trains to carry 2.2 billion people in a year ‚Äì almost a third of worlds‚Äô population, this system has seen and been through it all and has stood as a symbol of resilience in times of terror attack, deluge & disasters. And when it comes to seating, the relentless spirit with which a Mumbaikar can fearlessly squeeze through an already over-crowded compartment and even manage to latch on to a seat with a ‚Äòthoda adjust‚Äô mantra, is definitely no mean feat ‚Äì you‚Äôve got to see it to believe it!

Those people treat others like slaves. They like to do favors for others, but those favors are not free, they will cost you more than you can ever afford, they‚Äôll cost you your peace of mind, your serenity, and sometimes your integrity. You see, when you receive a favor from such a person, from that moment on you become indebted to him or her. They will expect something in return from you for that favor, and you‚Äôll wait anxiously when they‚Äôre going to ask you to do something back for them, and you won‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll ask you for, until that day comes. You‚Äôll essentially become a slave to their whim. The people who go through life using ‚Äò‚Äôfavors‚Äô‚Äô are cunning, domineering, controlling, they have no integrity, and no humanity. Their smiles are fake, their goodness is improvised, their compassion is self-serving, and they enjoy watching others squirm as they manipulate and steal their peace of mind.

And these three months was such a joyous journey. Each day I learn something new. Now it has become a part of my day to answer possible number of questions that I can. I love writing & wanted my journey to start somewhere. I can say my writings are helpful only when 80% people able to understand all the words & able to get what they are looking for. The best part about Quora is that there are so many people & so many stories to read. It can answer to almost any question, may it be related to Environment, Science, literature & infinite topics. The best part for me was that I came across some of the most creative writers that existed. There jargon of words, excellent vocabulary, using simple yet effective delivery of message. Everything was exemplary. If you want to improve your English writing skills, start with Quora. Start writing on whatever topic that interest you. It usually happens that People‚Äôs writing skills are better than English Speaking skills. However, it is not the same with me. But the credit goes to the English Application that I used at my early ages. I have talked about the app in my Quora space. ( I‚Äôll be really happy if you follow it. Link : [LINKED_TEXT: Times of Spoken English] [URL: https://timesofspokenenglish.quora.com/] I have suggested many tips & tricks like the Speech Shadowing Method & also How can you learn English implicitly. English is a skill and I believe its need to be enjoyed. ( No matter how many mistakes you make) I have met a lot of people who makes a lot of people but speaks with so confidently. They are the people who doesn‚Äôt fear about being judged & speaks un hesitantly. If you want to improve English fluently, you must be ready to accept the flaws and work on it. No matter whether you want to read anything, express you ideas on something or even speak in English fluently.

I entered Allen Kota for my PMT preparation. I was there for 2 years, 11th and 12th standard as they were called foundation and enthusiasm courses back then. I think the pressure they put on students there is off the charts. You don't get a single day off. Not even sundays. You get one day off in 15 days that is the day before your test they take. These tests have a huge amount of syllabus. And you have this immense pressure to do well in these tests or they single you out. Plus you have a bit of school pressure too. And you have to study whatever you are being taught and solve all the mcqs and be there for the 6 am class. I stayed in a super strict hostel (which was very well equipped ) so I wasn't even allowed to go out for more than half an hour. I started falling sick every week and herego fell behind. Once you start falling behind on the curriculum and still getting sick every week it becomes tough to keep up. The syllabus will keep increasing..There isn't a single day off. I understand the pressure of a competitive exam but you can't achieve results with crazy tests and no time to sleep. You don't have any real friends because those poor kids are also trying to survive. Competition is healthy but only competition and pressure is unhealthy. As a doctor if I take a stress test of those students no one will be of sane clear mind. I have been through MBBS and now I have cleared my PG exams too but I didn't need that kind of pressure to do it. And its again my personal view if I hadn't gone to Kota for my preparation I would have saved two good years of my life doing something much more productive than resisting the urge to turn into a robot. I had to take a drop year to clear my exams after boards. That place puts unnecessary stress on students which can be otherwise avoided. So I guess it was all in all a very bad experience but again just my opinion."},{"instruction":"What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?","output":"I‚Äôm adding a perspective that is not purely mine ‚Äì Bucky Fuller had this metaphor for his Pattern Integrity concept: ‚ÄúI am going to take a manila rope of a given diameter and given number of strands, and taking a piece of nylon rope of the same diameter, same number of strands. I'm going to splice the nylon into the end of the manila rope, and then to the nylon rope I'm going to splice in a cotton rope of the same diameter and number of strands.‚Äù It is available in all it‚Äôs long glory at [LINKED_TEXT: The Buckminster Fuller Institute ‚Äì Everything I Know, Chapter 3] [URL: https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/resources/everything-i-know/session-3]. Anyway, then he introduces the idea of a ‚Äúwalking knot‚Äù you make at the starting manila rope and slide it all the way to the finer cotton rope at the other end. The knot has an integrity as long as it has form and utility and it is not a ‚Äúnylon rope knot‚Äù nor a ‚Äúsubstance-shifting knot,‚Äù but only a sliding knot. This is its pattern integrity.* Well, to put back on topic I‚Äôd like to add that Theseus‚Äô ship is not simply that first instance, nor the second copy, but it‚Äôs mainly the pattern integrity (here as in design and overall quality) which can then be copied, duplicated, patched or anything‚Ä¶ * Then he goes and uses the metaphor to link the ropes to our ever-changing bodies and our minds as our pattern integrity‚Ä¶ Elsewhere he also says, ‚Äúonly integrity is going to count.‚Äù Very clever."},{"instruction":"After playing a fullsized bass guitar all night, does the low weight of a ukulele bass seem appealing?","output":"Funny you should ask.

The proxy server has its own IP address that is known by the computer. any web request sent to you goes to the proxy server first. it sends a request back and collects the data and makes the data available for you. it can change your IP address; hide your location as well as protect you from hackers A proxy can be a third-party server that allows you to send and receive network requests via their server by providing their IP address. After deploying a proxy, when you send a request to any website, they can only identify the IP address of the proxy server. This enables you to access the data anonymously. There are some pretty good uses of proxy server for example:- content filtering. 2. monitoring internet usage of children and employees. 3. privacy and security. 4. improved speed. also if you are in the data science or analytics field it‚Äôs important for you to get data and so web scraping comes in the game. where proxy servers are very helpful. if you want to know more about this you can check the blog out by [LINKED_TEXT: PromptCloud] [URL: https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/comprehensive-guide-to-choosing-a-proxy-service-for-your-web-scraper/] if you want. hope my answer was helpful to you."},{"instruction":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","output":"First off, Mr. [LINKED_TEXT: Adam D'Angelo] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Adam-DAngelo], I like your website. I wouldn‚Äôt make nearly daily visits to it, spend untold hours on it reading and writing, as well as going back to find and update, correct, or improve previous Answers or Comments, if I did not. And other people seemingly like my Answers and Comments since I am one of your Top Writers, a distinction that I appreciate having and being acknowledged for. That said, I wish it was easier to find and locate my past answers with something OTHER than the Notifications tab that was less transitory and I really wish there was a better search functions in the Content screen. If I miss a Notification, I‚Äôve often missed an opportunity to continue a conversation or to learn an important piece of information. And make no mistake, I have learned about a significant number of things here on Quora. One of my all time favorite sections of the site is a Space called ‚Äú[LINKED_TEXT: Straight From the Source] [URL: https://straightfromthesource.quora.com/]‚Äù where people who were directly involved in certain things like astronauts who were actually on certain flights or space missions, or, the people who invented or oversaw certain technologies like ground breaking visual effects in specific movies. Those stories are not only amazing, but exactly the kind of thing that I feel makes Quora such a great website. It does have its downsides too. In many ways, it‚Äôs like wikipedia and many, many people from that site are here as well for good, bad, and/or practical reasons. Many of the same problematic issues that that site is rife with are also present here on Quora like greatly biased presenting of information, but in THIS case, it‚Äôs OK because this site is more about relating personal knowledge and experience than regurgitating pre-published information and then justifying its use. For example, I can upload and use my own photos or photos that I find around the Net without fear of running afoul of some minor technical rule, or, have it stricken down because of someone‚Äôs pettiness or issue with me personally. I also believe and have seen consistent evidence of the following: Groups of accounts/profiles being used in concert to push certain agendas, or, to downvote opinions that they do not agree with. This is evident by the close knit circle of Profiles they Follow and who Follow them.Related to the previous observation, there are individual Troll profiles here on Quora (people rant and rave, not much you can do about that unless enough complain) and then there are organized groups of them. Quora Moderation needs to be doing everything in its power to shut down the organized ones.People are using the power of Quora simply as a means to spread their viewpoint instead of a blog or another kind of website where it would require MUCH more effort and/or expense to get followers.Some of the Quora Moderation is TOO automated and there also seems to be parts where the Human Moderators make decisions about things or subjects where they have NO KNOWLEDGE, or, have not taken the time to look at the source of a problem. I had one of my MOST VIEWED answers collapsed for plagiarism because I quoted another of MY OWN ANSWERS. Actions like that make Quora Moderation look stupid and drive people away.You have employees, program managers, that make promises and do not follow through on them, or, worse yet, make threats to Users about how they use Quora. For example‚Ä¶..When I first became a Top Writer I was told to be on the look out for an announcement about merchandise I could PURCHASE (not be given, mind you, but purchase) that was branded for the Top Write program. I never saw it, so I don‚Äôt know if it didn‚Äôt happen or I just didn‚Äôt see the notice.I created and manage a Quora Space. It took me a long time to come up with an idea for one from the time I was granted the ability. When I did, I was told that it was not within the policy of the program because Spaces were still in Beta and I should DELETE my Space. When I tried to explain its purpose, then I was threatened with a BNBP violation. Lastly, I know that many have bashed the QPP and it has its issues, but I for one think its great that the opportunity to earn income from providing information is a great thing. Could the program be refined, of course. My suggestion for this is to GREATLY improve the Question MERGE function. Maybe give it its own menu choices and DEFINITELY IMPROVE the ability to search for similar questions. The hundreds of basic math or ‚Äúwhat is the best [thing] in [city]?‚Äù questions are a HUGE turn off to people and the source of more complaints about the QPP than anything else. Telling people to just ‚Äúadjust their settings‚Äù is kind of an insult to their intelligence when Quora is running the program to encourage this kind of thing."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, offers various herbs and formulations that may help manage diabetes.

Because Adams was a Northerner and an open abolitionist he could not persuade southern slave owning congressmen to do this, or not strongly oppose it, while Jefferson could. As Adams was seen as an enemy of France, by France, it is less likely he could get the Louisiana purchase deal Jefferson did.

Dil Bechara, the last movie starring the late Sushant Singh Rajput, is a hindi adaptation of the worldwide famous movie The Fault in Our Stars which ,furthermore, is based on the bestselling novel The Fault in our Stars by John Green. Dil Bechara will forever be remembered for this face: This happy, bubbly face who is no longer with us. (So cliched, I know, but I really miss him) Now coming on to the review. I have read the book, seen the original movie and saw this one with deep concentration too so I feel like I qualify for reviewing the movie based on all the factors. I‚Äôll be unbiased and keep my opinions raw. This movie had its goods and bads. Things I didn‚Äôt like:The movie would have been so much better if it hadn‚Äôt been so hurried. It felt like everyone was just trying to get done with it. (sorry for the brutal honesty)I really don‚Äôt understand the sense behind cutting out Abhimanyu Veer's past story.For those of you who don‚Äôt know, Abhimanyu veer‚Äôs character was portrayed as Peter Van Houten in the book as well as in the movie and he was an author instead. He was an asshole to Hazel and Gus (lead characters in the actual movie) initially but the reason was disclosed in the ending when he attended Gus‚Äô funeral. It was revealed by him that the book was about his daughter and how she lost her battle with cancer and he didn‚Äôt complete the book because the reason had already gone (meaning his daughter).This plot should have been is Dil Bechara too! WHY WOULD THEY NOT INCLUDE IT? This was one of the most crucial part of the movie. The shooting of a movie within Dil Bechara.If you have seen the movie, you would know that they were shooting a movie. That simply was unneeded. Kizzie‚Äôs narration.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I loved Kizzie‚Äôs character. But I couldn‚Äôt attach myself to her as I could with Hazel. Things I did like:Sushant's acting was just FABULOUS. The idea of a song instead of a book. It really stood out to me.The acting of her parents was amazing!The music was again very unique and amazing. The song Mai Tumhara was perfectly synchronised with the plot.Sahil Vaid who portrayed JP did an awesome job as well.The ending. The ending was unbearable and beautiful at the same time.Unpopular opinion: Dil Bechara‚Äôs ending was way more emotional than the actual movie (or maybe it was just because of SSR?) To sum it up, the movie was quite good but like every sane movie, it wasn‚Äôt perfect. In terms of rating, I would give it a 3/5 Sorry to anyone who found this offensive. You are welcome to present your opinions in the comment section. Till then, cheers to life‚ù§Ô∏è"},{"instruction":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","output":"To begin with, it is a difficult, exhausting, and lengthy voyage. It is quite difficult to persevere through the torment of never-ending studies, tutorials, and more studies unless one has a strong desire to succeed. Second, the extended time of incubation between entering MBBS and becoming a full-fledged specialised doctor depletes many people. In comparison to many other occupations, long years of arduous training before settling down are quite difficult. This career is special in that it provides satisfaction by easing pain, treating, and curing numerous ailments.

I am assuming its a couple trip, so pardon me if some of these tips don‚Äôt apply to you. Carry sufficient cash with you, to the tune of 10,000 to 15,000 Rs for a 7‚Äì8 day long vacation. Bhutan is still primarily cash based economy, and many of the places do not accept cards. Of course there are ATMs to withdraw money from, but there is a hefty transaction charge you have to pay if you use these ATMs. Been there, done that.Transportation options are limited in Bhutan, its either public mini buses which are reasonable and cheap, or the cabs which usually are on costlier side. For a budget traveler, buses are perfect way to commute from either Thimphu to Punakha or from Thimphu to Paro. If you are hailing a cab then you can bargain with them. There are hardly any transportation options for within the city commutes other than hiring cabs. This is purposefully done to ensure employment to the locals.People in Bhutan are generally very polite and helpful. Try to return the favor by being nice to them, whether in restaurants or in the street or at any tourist places.Bhutanese streets are easily a thousand times cleaner than Indian streets. Maintain it that way. Littering on streets is a strict no no.If you enter Bhutan via Phuentsholling, then there is the visitor registration office about 50 meters from the entry gate, where you get the ‚Äòpermit‚Äô to enter Bhutan. All you need to do is fill up one form by giving your basic details, passport size photo, and photocopies of your identification documents. Best thing about going to Bhutan is that Indians don‚Äôt need to carry passports as the identification proof (though we carried it), your driving license or any address proof is enough. There is a photocopy shop right opposite to the office, in case you forget to bring photocopies of the documents, like we did :).From Phuentsholling, you get a 7 day permit, after which you are free to go to Thimphu or Paro as per your itinerary. For going to any other place (like Punakha), you need to get additional permit which you get only from Thimphu or Paro.Roads in Bhutan are full of zig zag twists and on the hilly terrain. Carry anti nausea tablets with you if you are prone to nausea.Follow local customs. In most of the dzongs (monasteries), there is certain dress code to be followed.Best time to visit Bhutan is October to March-April. But weather in Bhutan much more windy and chillier than India. Do carry warm clothes when you go.Lastly, do not, absolutely miss the trek to Tiger‚Äôs nest in Paro. the trek is moderately difficult, but totally worth the efforts.

Democide is the act of your government murdering you. Look it up: [LINKED_TEXT: 20th Century Democide20TH CENTURY DEMOCIDE IMPORTANT NOTE: Among all the democide estimates appearing on this website, and in the table on the lower right, some have been revised upward. I have changed that for Mao's famine, 1958-1962, from zero to 38,000,000. And thus I have had to change the overall democide for the PRC (1928-1987) from 38,702,000 to 76,702,000. Details here. I have changed my estimate for colonial democide from 870,000 to an additional 50,000,000. Details here . Thus, the new world total: old total 1900-1999 = 174,000,000. New World total = 174,000,000 + 38,000,000 (new for China) + 50,000,000 (new for Colonies) = 262,000,000. Just to give perspective on this incredible murder by government, if all these bodies were laid head to toe, with the average height being 5', then they would circle the earth ten times. Also, this democide murdered 6 times more people than died in combat in all the foreign and internal wars of the century. Finally, given popular estimates of the dead in a major nuclear war, this total democide is as though such a war did occur, but with its dead spread over a century.

The most popular of such courses is the coveted MBA program. The CAT 2023 exam is the most popular entrance exam, a gateway to 20 IIMs and over 1200 B-schools in India. A proper CAT 2023 strategy requires a candidate‚Äôs general aptitude, analytical abilities, and problem-solving skills which are essential for a manager. This is why having a CAT preparation strategy is important. Patience is crucial for the preparation of any competitive exam In order to build a fool proof CAT 2023 strategy, you need to be well acquainted with the CAT 2023 exam pattern. The CAT Exam is divided into 3 sections, spanning 40 minutes each, making it a 2-hour exam. To build a CAT 2023 strategy, understanding the CAT exam syllabus is crucial before you directly jump into your CAT 2023 preparation. After that, analyse the paper pattern by referring to the CAT past year papers. This analysis will help you identify your weak and strong areas. Using this information, you will understand which area will require more effort from your side. If you are wondering why you may not be able to solve all the questions, keep in mind that you can master any topic in the CAT syllabus with sufficient practice. For example, quantitative ability is an area found to be most difficult by aspirants from non-engineering backgrounds. Just focus on clearing your basics, then subsequently move on to the trickier concepts; with sufficient practice and a proper CAT 2023 strategy, you can easily score 99+ percentile. It might take you a lot of time to solve the questions at first but always remember that first you need to work on your accuracy, and with adequate practice, you‚Äôll automatically start taking less time to crack the solution. Solve previous year‚Äôs CAT exam papers to get an idea of what kind of questions you‚Äôll be facing. Once you are confident enough to solve all types of questions from a topic, start appearing for mocks and analyze them. Mocks are very important as taking them will get you into a habit of sitting for a 2 to 3-hour exam. They are also very important to figure out your weaknesses, and once you spot them, you should give them more attention. 1. Quantitative Ability (QA) Don‚Äôt leave any topic as you can get an easy question out of anyone. If you are not comfortable with some topic, just read its basics to solve conceptual problems. It is the most diverse area in the paper, and there are a lot of concepts involved. Hence one must be thorough with almost 95% of them. If the basics are strong, getting 99%ile + is easier for aspirants with a proper CAT preparation strategy. The major focus should be on arithmetic as it consists of many questions then followed by algebra, geometry, number system and modern maths. Work on calculations so that you can solve basic calculations within seconds. So learn tables and squares of numbers, and you will see that this will definitely increase the speed of solving. Solve as many questions from every topic, and try to be familiar with all the types of questions by practicing lots of varieties. 1.5 hours/day on weekdays and 5 hours/day on weekends or holidays should be the CAT 2023 strategy for the Quants section for working aspirants. If you are a non- working aspirant, 3-4 hours per day is the optimum time you should allot to the Quant section.

Here's how: 1. Find the tangential velocity at the equator: The Earth's radius is about [math]6.3cdot10^6 m[/math], and the Earth rotates [math]2pi rad[/math] every 86164 seconds (one sidereal day). Therefore, tangential velocity is: [math]dfrac{distance}{time} Rightarrow dfrac{2picdot6.3cdot10^6}{86164} approx 464 m/s[/math]. 2. Now that you have velocity, use [math]frac{v^2}{r}[/math] to get centripetal acceleration: [math]dfrac{464^2}{6.3cdot10^6} approx 0.034 m/s^2[/math]. 3. Multiply the centripetal acceleration by [math]-1cdot[/math](your mass) to get the centrifugal force on your body (the -1 is because centrifugal force is in the opposite direction as centripetal force). For example, if you weigh 70kg then the centrifugal force is about [math]-70kgcdot0.034 m/s^2 = -2.38 Newtons[/math] 4. Divide Newtons by [math]9.8 m/s^2[/math] (acceleration rate of gravity) to get the difference in weight at the equator vs the poles: [math]dfrac{-2.38 N}{9.8 m/s^2} = -0.243kg[/math] (about 0.3 percent). To find the weight difference at a location other than the equator, just multiply the acceleration (464 m/s) by the cosine of your latitude. For myself, at about 45 degrees north, this calculation gives: [math]-70cdotfrac{(464cdotcos(45))^2}{6.3cdot10^6} approx -1.19 N[/math], which is a weight difference of just under 0.2 percent."},{"instruction":"Does Putin care for the people of Russia?","output":"No, not if they disagree with him.

The language seems to have reached these proportions slowly in course of time because the ancient Telugus were described as hunters living along the river valleys of the Krishna and Godavari.According to some, Telugu was one among the earliest languages to separate from the Proto-Dravidian. Can‚Äôt believe? This is how Telugu used to be written in the 6th century A.D. 4. The first available written records in Telugu were created not by the Telugus but by the Raynaati Chola kings of the Tamil descent (specifically the Kalamalla inscription dating to 576 A.D. by Dhananjaya). The Telugu royal dynasties like the Sathavahanas, Bruhat-phalaayanas, Ananda-gotrikas, Saalankaayanas and Vishnukundins (‡∞∂‡∞æ‡∞§‡∞µ‡∞æ‡∞π‡∞®‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å, ‡∞¨‡±É‡∞π‡∞§‡±ç ‡∞´‡∞≤‡∞æ‡∞Ø‡∞®‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å, ‡∞Ü‡∞®‡∞Ç‡∞¶ ‡∞ó‡±ã‡∞§‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞ø‡∞ï‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å, ‡∞∂‡∞æ‡∞≤‡∞Ç‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞Ø‡∞®‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å, ‡∞µ‡∞ø‡∞∑‡±ç‡∞£‡±Å‡∞ï‡±Å‡∞Ç‡∞°‡∞ø‡∞®‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å) who ruled Andhra before the 6th century were all Brahmins and therefore employed only Sanskrit or Prakrit for all purposes, without caring to write anything in Telugu. 5. The British government made a thorough knowledge of Telugu language compulsory for all the British officials serving in South India. Contrary to the popular perception, the renowned British Telugu scholar Sir C.P. Brown was not at all a voluntary learner of Telugu. Actually he had no other option to secure his employment. Yet he had failed a number of times in the Telugu tests before coming out in flying colors at long last. 6. It is one of the 6 classical languages recognized by the GoI. 7. It is one of the few languages in the world which have all of their words ending in a vowel (ajantha bhaashas), alongside Italian, Japanese, Kannada and Sinhalese. 8. Telugu ranks 3rd among the South Asian languages by the number of speakers. The first and second being Hindi and Bengali respectively. 9. It ranks 15th among the top 20 languages spoken by half of the mankind among the 7,000 and odd living languages of the world.

And see also [LINKED_TEXT: The World‚Äôs Top 20 Languages] [URL: https://thelinguistblogger.wordpress.com/2008/04/18/the-worlds-top-20-languages/] 10. According to some Telugu scholars, Telugu is probably the one and only language which has been facing a very grave threat of extinction since times immemorial (or to have an approximation, increasingly since the last 400 years) due to the onslaught of superimposed languages which include Sanskrit, Prakrit, Persian, Urdu, English etc. Which other language will be imposed next, no one knows. It is perhaps the only language which still survives and grows, braving the repeated and very long-drawn cultural attacks on multiple fronts. 11. Its script is considered to be the second best in the world (the first being the Korean). See the link : [LINKED_TEXT: Korean Script 'Wins' Controversial 'Alphabet Olympics'] [URL: https://www.koreabang.com/2012/stories/korean-script-wins-controversial-alphabet-olympics.html] . Even English had to play a second fiddle to it. Owing to the wealth of characters it possesses, almost any language in the world can be written in it with 70% - 100% of accuracy. It enables the Telugus to become the indomitable polyglots. Due to the phonetic richness of Telugu, people trained to speak Telugu fluently will usually have no difficulty pronouncing any other language in the world. Intonation of the Vedas by Telugu scholars was acknowledged to be the best in yester years. 12. Telugu is the only Indian language to have separate honorific pronouns for the third person (Aayana and Aavida OR ‡∞Ü‡∞Ø‡∞®, ‡∞Ü‡∞µ‡∞ø‡∞°) besides another separate set of derogatory pronouns (Vaadu and Veedu OR ‡∞µ‡∞æ‡∞°‡±Å, ‡∞µ‡±Ä‡∞°‡±Å) for the same person. The language is also unique in having a separate honorific pronoun in the second person (‡∞§‡∞Æ‡∞∞‡±Å). 13. The highly evolved literary art of Avadhaanam is very unique to Telugu which cannot be found in other languages except Tamil. 14. At one point of time (1939) in history, Telugu happened to be the last of the South Indian languages to be represented on the currency minted by the GoI. 15. It is perhaps the only South Indian language to face an informal ban by a government (of the erstwhile Nizam Nawabs in Telangana). See the text image below as also the link : http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/1882/6/06_chapter2.pdf 16. Conversely, it is the only Indian language which was heavily patronized outside its cradle/ dominion. The corpus of the ancient Telugu literature which grew in the Tamilnadu kingdoms (like Chenji, Tanjore and Madurai), Orissa and Mysore almost rivals that available in Andhra and Telangana. Telugu is the only language in the country, by the name of which a foreign dynasty preferred to call itself. The Kutb Shahi Sultans (1518‚Äì1687 A.D.) of Golkonda, who ruled over Andhra and Telangana, originally hailed from Persia. But they were called ‚ÄòTelugu Sultans‚Äô for their love of the language. They had even Telugu poetic works dedicated to them.

But credit is due to these truly secular rulers of Golkonda for their love of Hinduism. Of them, a Sultan named Quli Qutb Shah was a staunch Rama-bhaktha too). 17. Carnatic classical music, an extremely complex form of music, systematized by saint Purandara Daasa in the 13th century, owes its vast body of recent compositions to the so called Musical Trinity, who lived between mid 18th century and early 19th century: Saint Tyagaraja, Mutthu Swami Deekhithar and Syaama Sastry. What is interesting is, due to Tyagaraja's vast disciple order, a majority of the compositions were done in Telugu. So, it is very likely that any Carnatic classical music concert will be sung mostly in Telugu. (Thanks to Hari Tadepalli for contributing this important detail). 18. Telugu acts as an insulator or shock-absorber for Tamil, being the first to bear the brunt of the cultural impacts emerging from the North like a Himalayan barrier. These and many more. I will make suitable edits whenever I remember them. ‚ÄîSUBRAHMANYAM MARRIPOODI (06.10.2017)"},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"There are debates whether the Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary. There are those believe Japan back then was for all out surrender and what the US did was a war crime and genocide. The argument on the other side was Japan would not have surrendered without the bombs and things will turn out worse if Japan fought on. If I were to go back in time (which is impossible), I will replace the recording of Hirohito‚Äôs surrender speech with a Japanese translation of Hitler‚Äôs speech telling the people not to give in and let the Allies find nothing if they were able to set foot on Japanese soil. Tell people death is better than dishonor and kill themselves like what was done in Saipan and Okinawa. This way there can be no debate as to whether the bombings were right or not."},{"instruction":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","output":"It wasn‚Äôt the American government that lead to the 2nd Amendment. It was the kings and queens of Europe, especially George of England whom the Americans had just fought a rebellion against. The founders wanted to make sure that Americans, in case of war/invasion or if the new government they created turned oppressively and tyrannical, would be able to do something about it. They did not want a standing army with troops on every corner, as was common at the time (police, as we know them today, didn‚Äôt exist) and they wanted to make sure citizens could stand up for themselves and each other."},{"instruction":"Was Iran/Persia powerful before? Was it full of barbarians as mentioned in the movie ‚Äú300‚Äù? If it was, then did Persians raise the three empires of Achamedians, Safavid, and Sasanian?","output":"The Persians were very powerful for a very long time. The movie 300 said nothing about the Persians being barbarians. The Greeks thought anybody who was not Greek was a barbarian, but even in the movie 300, it was pretty obvious that the Persians had a thriving and sophisticated empire. History absolutely verifies that the Persian Empire was a powerful civilization."},{"instruction":"Which type of tree is the most unique?","output":"Trees are the plant world's often understated hard laborers. We clean up the environment, help keep our communities (and the planet) safe, and they're always fun to be around. Trees are all over the place too. There are more than three trillion around the world! So it's pretty easy not to notice even the trees in our midst. It makes it much harder not to note any of the most beautiful, unusual trees in the country. Some are old, some enormous and some sacred. Below are the five absolutely rare plants. 1. The highest branch, Hyperion. [LINKED_TEXT: Visit] [URL: http://woodtoolspoint.com/] Hyperion is the name granted to a coastal redwood found in Northern California (Sequoia sempervirens). It is 379.1 foot tall which making it the planet's tallest living oak. It was found in 2006 in Redwood National Park, by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor. Hyperion is unique since it resides on a hillside instead of flat land. It is also lucky-96 percent of the original growth forest that surrounds it has been logged immediately. 2. The highest oak, General Sherman. [LINKED_TEXT: Visit] [URL: http://woodtoolspoint.com/] Though found in Northern California, General Sherman, now situated in California, is the biggest tree on the earth that has existed between 2300 and 2700 years. By volume, it's also the biggest vine. It is 275 feet wide, and 25 feet in diameter. Its volume is estimated at 52.513 cubic feet. That's quite a lot of trees! 3. The oldest organism, Pando. [LINKED_TEXT: Visit] [URL: http://woodtoolspoint.com/] Pando is the oldest living organism in the world. Pando, meaning \\"I scatter\\" in Latin, is not just a single vine, but a whole colony of quaking aspen plants. Located in Utah, Pando is estimated to be 80,000 years old and is made entirely of genetically identical trees. Some estimates of the 105-acre colony date back as far as a million years ago. Pando is the heaviest living organism, too. 4. Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, the holiest tree in the world. [LINKED_TEXT: Visit] [URL: http://woodtoolspoint.com/] The most sacred of trees is difficult to ascertain, but Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, a fig tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, is the one most versed and worshiped far and away. It is the most southerly branch in India of the Bodhi Tree, where Buddha has attained illumination. The trees were planted in 288 BC and were purposely planted as the oldest crop. Buddhists around the world are revered. 5. The oldest tree in the world, Methuselah. [LINKED_TEXT: Visit] [URL: http://woodtoolspoint.com/] Methuselah is Bristlecone pine, found 10,000 feet above sea level in Inyo National Forest in California at an unrevealed location. In Northern California. It is believed that Methuselah is around 5,000 years old. Its location is kept secret so as to protect it from the destructive behavior of some humans. No photos of the tree have been made public, so we can't say what it looks like."},{"instruction":"What really makes acoustic instruments sound so different to synthesized ones? Listening to 60s pop/rock I'm impressed by how many instruments seem to fit into the mix compared to when I use synths in a DAW.","output":"There is no intrinsic difference between acoustic and synthesized instruments. The difference is in approach. There are examples of disco tracks that integrated a mini-Moog (or something fat sounding like that) in the whole disco orchestra of strings, brass, background choir, percussion, multiple rhythm guitars. The trick is to thin the sound out, retaining the essential quality, and then integrate it in the mix the same way you would do if you added, say, a trombone. And believe me, a trombone sounds as fat as as mini-Moog if you close-mike it. For another example, listen to the keyboard player in Earth Wind & Fire. He plays against a fairly thick band sound including horns, but if you get the volume and timbre balance right, it will fit in the mix."},{"instruction":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","output":"Original Question: ‚ÄúFor pro-choice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?‚Äù What you‚Äôre ACTUALLY asking is: Should the man‚Äôs wishes override the woman‚Äôs wish because men are superior to women, and should have final say and control over a woman?‚Äù The answer to both is NO. It‚Äôs the woman‚Äôs body, therefore SHE ALONE should have the final decision over what happens with her body, with her life, her job, what she eats, who she has sex with, whether or not she gets married, and so forth. I am sick and fucking tired of this misogynistic horseshit that a woman isn‚Äôt equal and that to be ‚Äúcomplete and happy‚Äù they need to be married and have children, that she was ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù because she wore clothes that she wanted to, that she needs a man in her life, and so on. Listen up boys, and yes, those of you males who think like the above are BOYS not men, women don‚Äôt need boys or men. They are a complete person who can make their own choices, their own money, make their own clothing choices, and so on and should NEVER EVER EVER have to put up with the fucking catcalls, being treated like a piece of meat, nor have their value as a human being reduced to their fucking looks. GROW UP, and while you‚Äôre fucking at it, learn to stop thinking with your dicks and stop thinking you‚Äôre all that, because you‚Äôre not. If every single woman in this world decided none of us ever have a relationship or sex again, the human race wouldn‚Äôt die out, only the pigs like you would. Why? Because women could wait until ALL of us males are dead, teaching young girls how to combine sperm from sperm banks, and eggs that were frozen so they‚Äôll create a zygote, and then teach those babies how NOT to be sexist, misogynistic assholes.

However, there are pros and cons associated with both. Plant proteins are considered ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù, as they do not contain unhealthy fats like chicken or pork. But plant proteins are also incomplete - where animal protein contains all essential amino acids. Some animal protein, especially fish, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These are considered good fats, and evidence exists that they can be helpful in preventing sudden death or heart failure in people with a history of cardiovascular diseases. While there are some plant sources which contain omega 3 fatty acids- they also contain a high amount of unhealthy fats. There is no reliable plant protein that contains vitamin B12, which is a crucial vitamin for our bodies. Vitamin B12 helps in fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, DNA synthesis, maturation of red blood cells and functioning of the nervous system. Non-vegetarians can easily get vitamin B12 from animal proteins. Vegetarians will need to supplement it. Hence, it is essential that you have a well-balanced diet. If you are strictly vegetarian or vegan, you must eat different types of plant foods to make sure you get all the proteins you need. Consult a doctor if you need supplements.

Anemia occurs when there is a decreased number of red blood cells or a decreased amount of hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, so when there is insufficient iron, the body may not produce enough healthy red blood cells, leading to anemia. Symptoms of anemia can include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, dizziness, and poor concentration.Reduced immune function: Iron is important for a healthy immune system. Iron deficiency can weaken the immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections and illnesses.Impaired cognitive function: Iron deficiency has been associated with cognitive impairments, especially in children. It can affect learning ability, attention span, memory, and overall cognitive development.Fatigue and weakness: Iron is involved in the production of energy and the metabolism of nutrients. Insufficient iron levels can result in low energy levels, persistent fatigue, and general weakness.Pale skin and brittle nails: In severe cases of iron deficiency, the skin may become pale or have a yellowish tinge. Brittle or spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) can also be a sign of iron deficiency.Restless legs syndrome: Iron deficiency has been linked to restless legs syndrome (RLS), a condition characterized by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations.Pica: Some people with iron deficiency may develop a condition called pica, where they have cravings for non-food substances like ice, dirt, clay, or paper.

Based on past performance and the current economic environment, we selected 8 strong investment options to consider. 8 best ways to invest 20K right now 1. Conservative investments For risk-averse investors or those with a short time horizon ‚Äî like those nearing retirement ‚Äî low-risk securities such as Treasuries, money market funds and bank deposit products provide an unmatched level of safety and reliability compared to riskier investments. For instance, US Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, so there‚Äôs little chance of default. And aside from the gauranteed fixed-rate of return on certificates of deposit (CDs), these bank products are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to 250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, in the event the bank goes under. Conservative investments like these aren‚Äôt designed to produce large returns but rather are meant to preserve the purchasing power of one‚Äôs capital with low risk. Types of conservative investments US Treasuries, including Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury BondsHigh-yield savings accountCDsMoney market fundsDividend-paying stocksCorporate bondsMunicipal bondsFixed annuitiesGold (physical gold and gold stocks) Pros Low risk.Stability.Conservation of capital. Cons Low return potential.Lower flexibility.Inflation risk. 2. Retirement accounts Those with a 401(k) and company match may want to invest at least enough in the 401(k) to earn the full match ‚Äî it‚Äôs free money you should prioritize. After that, turn your focus to maxing out an individual retirement account (IRA). IRAs offer a much greater selection of investment options compared to a 401(k)s. Maxing out your IRA early in the year is probably one of the best investment decisions you can make. If you don‚Äôt yet have an IRA account, consider opening one. The 2023 maximum contribution for an IRA is 6,500, which is just over 30% of your 20,000. Since you can invest in individual stocks, ETFs and a range of other assets, IRAs make for worthy investment vehicles. Pros Tax benefitsMatching contributions from your employer. Cons Deposit limitations.Withdrawal limitations. 3. Stocks Traditionally, equities have outperformed other asset classes. So the sooner you invest your 20k ‚Äî or part of it ‚Äî to use on the stock market, the sooner you can reap the benefits. Pros Great performance.Variety of options.High liquidity. Cons Volatility.Requires research 4. Exchange-traded funds ETFs come in all flavors, but index funds ‚Äî ETFs that match the moves of indices such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq ‚Äî provide a simple, pain-free way to invest. Which ETF you choose depends on how close you are to retirement and how much risk you‚Äôre willing to take. In the past, index ETFs, blue chip ETFs and dividend ETFs have consistently performed well with relatively low risk, making them a solid investment choice. Pros Variety of investment options.Trade like stocks.Convenience. Cons Expense ratio.Leveraged ETF gains can be misleading. 5. Robo-advisor If the previous option seems too complicated or you don‚Äôt have the time to research, an excellent option is to invest your 20k is with a robo-advisor. These computer algorithms allocate your funds based on specific parameters you set. Pros Great for hands-off investors.Invests in ETFs and mutual funds.Less expensive than a financial advisor. Cons Robo-advisors can‚Äôt get to know you.Can‚Äôt handle complex portfolios. 7. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) Although 20,000 may not be enough to purchase a property directly, you can buy part of it and even earn rental income through REITs. This option is often reserved for those who want passive income and low risk ‚Äî and especially those who invest for the long term. Pros Earn rental income.Capital appreciation.Some REITs are publicly traded. Cons High taxes.Low liquidity. 8. Cryptocurrencies Crypto can be lucrative, but it‚Äôs also highly speculative and should only be explored if your portfolio can weather the volatility. Because of this, consider investing a small amount of your 20k. Cryptocurrency investment has always been an alternate investment that requires the lowest capital to startup. Generally, you can start with as low as 1, 10, 100, 1000 or any capital you consider small to earn consistent profit returns to your crypto portfolio up to 25% ROI and investors can get started investing in platform such as CAPITALINTEREST (www.capitalinterest .net) which has made crypto earning swift and easy for both beginners and professionals with zero fees.

The ability to understand and analyze threats to a business is important. This is especially true if it‚Äôs a large, established multi-billion dollar business that needs to focus on protecting its downside. Companies have entire teams focused on identifying and neutralizing potential threats. Sometimes this is necessary, but oftentimes it‚Äôs not. Many threats are not as severe as they initially seem. And if a business spends all its focus on threats, it will no longer innovate and no longer grow. If you want to be a 10xer, you need to be the one discovering massive opportunities for growth. And the younger the business, the more time should be spent on growth vs. threats. This is hard because the threats are real. They are important. They could really hurt the company. And the big threats should definitely be tackled head-on. But not every threat needs to be addressed. And even those that do need to be addressed don‚Äôt need to be addressed fully. It takes experience to discern which threats are important to mitigate and which threats are less severe. Employees with large company experience are often in ‚Äúthreat-mode‚Äù more than they should be. This gives you a potential advantage. Smart employees at start-ups often spend over 80% of their time on threats and less than 10% on opportunities. But the 10xers spend over 50% on opportunities. That‚Äôs how you can start to become a 10xer; spend more time on finding opportunities than you do identifying threats.

The earth‚Äôs rotation does affect weight, in three ways (heh). One, the inertial effect due to rotation (usually known as centrifugal force) causes a measurement of weight to be lighter at the equator than the poles. Two, the earth‚Äôs rotation causes a bulge at the equator of twenty kilometers, which means objects at the equator are farther away from the center of mass of the earth, and therefore weigh less. Three, the oblateness of the earth means that you can't just assume that all the mass is concentrated at the center of mass. The last two tend to cancel each other.

The fall of Stalingrad would‚Äôve closed the Soviet Union‚Äôs access to their most vital war resource‚Ä¶ Caucasus oil. Citino noted that after Stalingrad, Army Group South‚Äôs soldiers looked like a high school football team. They were no longer the seasoned and highly professional 25 year olds that the Soviets wasted nearly 3 million men to finally take down. Plus, the Soviets succeeded in keeping open the highways to Caucasus oil, allowing them an endless supply of oil for their massive tank divisions. Without Stalingrad, Kursk couldn‚Äôt have happened. Not only was Stalingrad important because it kept open the roads for oil, but also because it took Hitler‚Äôs most professional soldiers out of the fight.

This flexibility allows you to choose the best network coverage, rates, and services based on your needs and location.Multiple Profiles: eSIM-enabled devices can store multiple operator profiles simultaneously. This means you can have multiple phone numbers or data plans on a single device, making it convenient for those who need separate personal and business numbers or frequently travel between different countries or regions.Remote Activation: eSIM cards can be activated remotely, typically through a QR code or an activation process provided by the mobile network operator or eSIM provider. This eliminates the need to visit a physical store or wait for a physical SIM card to be shipped to you. It offers convenience, especially when you're in a different country and need to quickly access mobile services. [LINKED_TEXT: Roaming eSIM Card] [URL: https://www.onesimcard.com/esim/]Cost Savings: eSIM cards can provide cost savings, particularly when traveling internationally. Instead of relying on expensive international roaming services, you can switch to a local operator or choose a more affordable international data plan specific to your destination. This can help you avoid excessive roaming charges and potentially save money on communication expenses.Device Design: eSIM cards are embedded directly into the device during manufacturing, eliminating the need for a physical SIM card slot. This allows for slimmer and more streamlined device designs, creating more space for other components or enabling manufacturers to make devices more water-resistant.Easy Management: Managing eSIM profiles is typically done through the device's settings or a dedicated app. This makes it easy to switch between profiles, activate new ones, or manage data plans without requiring physical SIM card handling or contacting customer support. It's worth noting that eSIM adoption is still growing, and not all mobile network operators and devices support eSIM technology. Before considering an eSIM, ensure that your device is eSIM-compatible and that your mobile network operator or eSIM provider supports eSIM activation and usage."},{"instruction":"Why is rupee falling against the US dollar?

This is one of Nostradamus unsolved quatrains for 5 centuries till now. Please have look at his quatrain Century III, Quatrain 75. . ‚ÄúPau, Verona, Vicenza, Saragossa‚Äù(Saragouffe), ‚ÄúShall be hit by the distant swords, the country (lands) wet with blood, ‚ÄúSo great a plague will come with the great shell, ‚ÄúThough the Relief be near, and the remedies shall be far off.‚Äù So far we have known only that the first line meant the towns in Italy (as per Theophilus de Garencieres who spent his life deciphering Nostradamus predictions), the rest of the quatrain was a puzzle ( words like blood, plague, shell, relief and cure ) because there was no outbreak in Italy so far. Now, we could connect with the recent events in Italy: This should be close to getting near to understanding Nostradamus predictions. First Line : Cities in Italy. Pau is a municipality in the Sardina region of Italy, Verona, Vicenza are still in Italy, Verona is a city in northern Italy‚Äôs Veneto region, Vicenza is a city in the Veneto region of northeast Italy and Saragossa in Spain. Second Line: He mentions blood, he must have seen in his vision the Flag of China (Flag color). In other quatrains also he mentions the communist China as red or blood. Third Line: He mentions Great Shell (means airplanes), Of course Nostradamus in the 15th century would have seen an airplane in his vision and would have tried to assume the shape of airplane as shell). We know that Covid 19 spread through air travel to Italy through a passenger who visited China. Italy Covid -patient one ‚Äì identified as ‚ÄúMattia‚Äù ‚Äì who remains seriously ill in hospital in Pavia, south of Milan, the man‚Äôs wife recalled he may have had contact with a friend recently returned from China Fourth line : Relief near but remedies very far‚Ä¶ well we know that there are no vaccines yet but Nostradamus gives us a clue that relief is near‚Ä¶..but when he means remedy is far does he mean the US pharmaceutical companies or from China. Its seems now that the plague he mentions in Line 3 could be Coranovirus. For more readers who want to delve in Nostradamus, you should also know that al his quatrains was published in London, 1672, deciphered and translated by Theophilus Garencieres, who was a French apothecary who spent most of his life practicing in England Born in Paris, Garencieres (1610‚Äì1680) studied the prophecies of Nostradamus at an early age, and these had a lasting effect on him. He studied at the University of Caen, which he left with a Doctorate of medicine in 1636. To avoid religious persecution, he moved to the University of Oxford during the 1640s, which finally granted him the same qualification in 1657. He was the first to translate Nostradamus book of prophecies into English.

My daughter was telling me about an event in her school. A girl in her class drew an apple, and when she was done, said out loud: This drawing is garbage, utterly terrible! My daughter was confused: But, mom, her apple looked so cool! It wasn‚Äôt terrible at all! This story was another opportunity for me as a mom to remind my daughter of something we spoke about since she was a toddler. It is something really simple but deeply beautiful and true, something we forget to remind ourselves of, and almost never teach our children. I told her: There are many people who love you and who will cheer for you: your mom, dad, relatives and friends. However, there will be moments in your life when you feel sad, discouraged, frustrated or scared, but find yourself without those people near you to root for you and cheer you on. In those moments a little voice that lives inside your heart will speak to you. What it will say depends on what you teach it and what you put inside your heart now, in peaceful times. Whenever my children do something good, accomplish any little progress or victory, I remind them to congratulate themselves. I jokingly say: Don‚Äôt forget to give yourself a high-five! When my children fail at something, make a mistake, or are disappointed about something they didn‚Äôt do well, I encourage them to be kind and loving to themselves, and to continue on their way, accepting occasional defeat as a normal part of life. I reminded her of these times. and continued: There will be moments when you will feel that things aren‚Äôt going the way you wish, and there will be people in your life who will make things difficult for you. In those moments the little voice inside you can make all the difference. There are people whose little voice tells them negative things. When they don‚Äôt succeed in something, the voice tells them that they are bad, losers and that they deserve to be defeated. Their inner voice scolds them, making them feel even worse. On the other hand, there are people whose inner voice is their ally and their biggest cheerleader. When they are down, it comforts them, saying all will be ok. When they fail at something, their inner voice encourages them to try again, reminding them of many times they did something well. When they are angry, their inner voice calms them down. It roots for them, holding their hand in times when they are alone, without those who usually support them. My daughter loves this story, and remembers it as a game in her everyday life. I made it into a fun exercise, so she easily and spontaneously goes to it. When she studies or draws and makes a mistake, I sometimes hear her saying to herself: I can totally do this! When I see her being this gentle and supportive towards herself, my heart feels as if thousand flowers sprung into bloom inside it. We cannot be there for our children all the time, and more importantly, we should not aim to be. We should not be constantly jumping in, whenever they face trouble or difficulty as they make their way through life. However, we can give them tools which will help them gain confidence and develop inner self-support, crucial for emotional stability and well balanced identity. This story about inner voice, little cheerleader inside our children‚Äôs hearts, is an useful parenting tool to help our children learn that it is all right to love themselves and treat themselves gently, as well as be their own motivators, encouraging, comforting and guiding themselves as they face different challenges of their lives. Essence of parenting is being your children‚Äôs wings only until their own are strong enough for flight. Then it is time to encourage them to use their own wings, falling in love with the beauty and wonder of flight. Do not forget this though: Our children will believe in their ability to fly only if we believe in them first.

Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT)M.I.T. College of Engineering (MITCOE)MIT Academy of Engineering (MITAOE) All 3 colleges are affiliated to the Pune University. MIT & MICOE are located in the heart of Pune city i.e. in Kothrud area while MITAOE is about 20 Kms away from city i.e. at Alandi. But still MITAOE may lead in cut offs because now its an ‚ÄúAutonomous Institute‚Äù (from 2016‚Äì17 batch).Fees-Fees is nearly same for all 3 colleges , they can differ only by 4‚Äì5 thousands. Life at Campus-If you are addicted to city life, then you must opt for Kothrud Campus. Here,You will get the real feel of ‚ÄúPune City Life‚Äù as its one of the most prestigious areas of Pune. You will get all variety of food stuff, stationary,hostels, flats on rent and all other facilities which you will need. While at Alandi campus you will surely miss many of these things. But both campuses are very clean and beautiful. The dome shaped buildings make them different from others.Events-MIT, Kothrud is known for the variety of events which it hosts. Huge number of Students across the country attend various Technical events such as Texephyr, Nirmitee, Tesla & other Non Technical events such as Summit, Bhartiya Chhatra Sansad etc. every year.Faculty-Faculty of all the 3 campuses is nearly same in quality but most of the experienced teachers are at main MIT college. But don‚Äôt worry, because in engineering, your own study & hard work matter the most .Placements- MIT institutes follow central placement system. Placement procedure is generally held at main MIT kothrud campus hence students of Alandi campus have to travel every time and come at Kothrud. But this scenario may change from 2016‚Äì17 batch as MITAOE has got autonomy.Looking at the stats of last few years, Placements of Comp, It, Entc are far better than other branches .But it may change in coming future.

The only thing large enough that you might be able to make out the shape, if you catch it silhouetted against the moon (and really, binocs or a small telescope still help) is the ISS, because compared to most satellites it is both huge (over 100 metres across when most are only 1 or 2 metres), and travels in quite a low orbit (about 400‚Äì800km, hence its very rapid ~90 minute transit around the world), making a tiny but definite H-shaped speck against a bright background. (it also transits the sun, but attempting to see THAT with the naked eye is a BAD IDEA) Oh, and of course, if you do manage to spot it racing across the face of the moon, you just saw two satellites for the price of one :) Annoyingly, if any of the other inner, rocky planets had moons large and high-orbit enough to be worthy of mention (Deimos and Phobos are essentially captured asteroids, and both tiny and in extremely low, rapid, inexorably decaying orbits, so ignore them), then there‚Äôs a very good chance we would be able to make them out from Earth as separate entities‚Ä¶ but they don‚Äôt.

Gravity is currently explained by Einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity. The electromagnetic, the strong and the weak forces are described by quantum field theory, which forms the theoretical basis for the Standard Model of particle physics. From an empirical point of view, the standard model has provided physicists with an immensely successful account of elementary particles, but it ignores the effects of gravity, which is negligible at the quantum level in all but very few scenarios (e.g, black holes). The result is two incompatible approaches: the theory of general relativity, which is applicable at large scales, and the standard model, which is applicable at the quantum scale. This situation is deemed extremely problematic and a successful unification of the four forces, or a quantum theory of gravity, has been become for many theorists, the ‚ÄúHoly Grail‚Äù of physics. The difficulties in drawing any clear demarcation between science and non-science emerge clearly when we take into account the fact that string theory is not really a theory, in any logical sense, but rather an attempt to construct a unified theory of quantum gravity and elementary particle physics. Physicists have found that the equations of superstring theory ‚Äúhave many solutions‚Äù, each ‚Äúcorresponding to a universe with different properties‚Äù. (MULTIVERSES). Yet, as Green points out, the case in string theory is admittedly different, insofar as ‚Äúeach different solution defines a different set of particles and fields,‚Äù not merely a different space-time geometry. In recent years a number of string theorists, most notably Susskind, have interpreted this situation, not as a failure of string theory, but as an indication that our conception of the universe must be radically revised. String Theory needs a deep understanding of advanced Mathematics and huge investment in technology to test it.(e.g.,to find supersymmetry b/w particles)."},{"instruction":"When will humans be technologically advanced enough to fight off an alien invasion?","output":"When we are capable of interstellar travel.

As an example, Horace Mann is probably considered the top independent high school in NYC, but that has virtually nothing to do with its incredible physical facilities, and everything to do with the quality of its education. So in the case of Brearley, for example, the fact that it is a relatively tiny school with zero in the way of facilities, doesn‚Äôt mean much to anyone who is looking for possibly the single best academic girls‚Äô education in the country. But although the above answer is technically accurate, underlying the question is something quite different; something that has really interesting overtones and undercurrents of culture, religion, class, parenting style and philosophy. The elite NYC high schools are all day schools; Exeter and Andover are both boarding schools. For a certain class of traditional, old-money, WASP families, it was (and to an extent still is) the absolute norm to send your teenage children off to boarding school. There they could develop their mind, body, and social skills in a safe environment of similar children. To those parents, having your child not go to a name-brand boarding school would immediately cause raised eyebrows among your peers. They might look at families whose children stayed at home and went to day schools [often with a large Jewish population] in the way that a Princetonian might look at someone attending City College. On the flip side, for a particular class of upper-middle income, intellectual/professional, second or third generation American, often Jewish, close-knit family, the idea of sending your children away at age 14 is about as comprehensible to them as giving them up for adoption to China. The perspectives really are that starkly different. Even today, when both sets of schools are much more heterogeneous in their student body demographics, each of the two family types regards the other with a certain combination of pity, disdain and superiority.

Inko has mild telekinesis. Mitsuki‚Äôs quirk keeps her looking young, but at least she can and would probably hit pretty hard. Rei has an ice quirk that one could assume is probably pretty strong, otherwise Enji wouldn‚Äôt have picked her, but she‚Äôs so emotionally damaged, that she‚Äôs lived in a hospital for ~a decade where she likely is restricted from using her quirk at all. We‚Äôve seen Ochako‚Äôs parents, but not with any real detail. Yuga's mother hasn‚Äôt demonstrated a quirk and was living in fear and spying for AFO, so probably not a big power house there. Honestly, the only powerful mother I can think of in the series is kinda dead. Nana (the holder of OFA prior to Toshinori) was pretty powerful. However, her son was barely a character, and as I mentioned, she‚Äôs kinda dead. The only reason she has any screen time outside of flashbacks is because the Vestiges live inside OFA and occasionally talk with Izuku. If I had to guess, given just how few married pro heroes we‚Äôve seen (not to mention, parent heroes,) is that part of the sexism women face in that world prevents most serious women pro heroes from even entertaining the possibility of having kids or being in an open, serious relationship. Women heroes are already held to a different standard, being expected to do more superficial nonsense, like the commercials Momo got stuck doing during her internship. Considering how risky it is, it makes sense that pro heroes would be less likely to have kids.

If it was just a job to have a paycheck while I figured out what I wanted to do, I‚Äôd reconsider if I really want that job. But if it‚Äôs a job in my career path and I think I‚Äôm qualified for it, yes I‚Äôd apply again. However, if I failed to even get an interview last time, that would tell me my resume is not up to par. Many larger companies actually use computers to scan through resumes and look for key words. They want to see specific words on your resume, and if you have too many red flag words, your resume won‚Äôt even end up in front of a real person. So if I didn‚Äôt even get a call, I know my resume needs redone so it will end up at an actual person. If I got an interview and didn‚Äôt get the job, I would reevaluate how my interview went last time and what I could do to improve it. It could even be that I passed the interview last time, but someone else had a slightly stronger interview and got the one job opening, and they left or need a helper and now another job has opened up. Maybe I just need to reapply to show them I‚Äôm still interested, and the interview ends up just being a conversation because they already know I fit the job. It could be that I messed up on an answer or was just super nervous and flustered and stumbled through the interview (usually my problem). It could be that they run the interview in STAR method and I didn‚Äôt know what that was the first time but totally aced it the second time (sort of happened. I found out an interview was STAR and had no idea what that meant, so of course I failed. 8 months later at a different job I was up for promotion through STAR interview and I passed it because I understood the format). It could be I didn‚Äôt have the experience they were looking for 4 months ago but now I do. There‚Äôs a lot of things that could be different between my interview 4 months ago and now, even for the same job with the same interviewer. If this job is on your career path, why not try? Worst that can happen is they say it‚Äôs too soon, try again in 6‚Äì12 months."},{"instruction":"What is the best Bollywood song for caller tune?","output":"Oh humsafer"},{"instruction":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","output":"There probably are.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","output":"I can answer the first question from personal experience. Just before Easter, I had problems breathing. So I completed a short questionnaire on the NHS 111 website. 2 1/2 hours later, having spoken to two doctors, I‚Äôd been collected by an ambulance and was in a bed in A&E. I had blood tests, X-rays, CT scans, two courses of antibiotics and god knows what else over the next week when I was taken home in another ambulance. The diagnosis was that I had embolisms in both lungs which were treated with no problems. However, I was told the scans had given them cause for concern and I was to be investigated urgently for two different cancers. A colonoscopy soon gave the all-clear on the first one, but further investigations at another hospital led to more antibiotics, an MRI scan, then more blood and urine tests and a CT scan before a biopsy revealed I had prostate cancer. I am now nearing the end of a six-month course of hormone suppression, to shrink the prostate and am hoping Covid does not interfere with the 39 radiotherapy sessions due to start in February. The silver lining is that the cancer was found long before I would have seen a doctor as I was unaware of any symptoms, other than what I thought normal for my age. Apart from transport costs, except the ambulances which were free, this has cost me absolutely nothing. The NHS has not charged me anything.

But the reasons of them are quite different. (1) China: China has a lot of different cultures in it, but sometimes they show quite insular aspects against foreign cultures. But it‚Äôs usually because of their nationalistic policy, not their natural manners. It‚Äôs more of the matter of the 1st nations vs. others including China. But other than such political reasons, China is not that exclusive against other cultures. They have been, rather, quite inclusive and generous. Past dynasties of China accepted many Western and Middle-East knowledges. ‚Üí POLITICAL EXCLUSIVENESS ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE WEST (2) North Korea: The most exclusive one in East Asia, maybe‚Ä¶ (3) South Korea: South Koreans‚Äô tendency or characteristics are mostly made since the 20th century. Since they suffered such a turbulent modern history, they got very protective that they sometimes show quite xenophobic and exclusive or conservative attitude against exotic cultures except for well-known Western cultures. Sometimes, their tendency makes them not accept criticism from foreigners. I think the exclusiveness of both Koreas is shared with a common root: protecting their countries against outside forces. It‚Äôs because Korea historically suffered from invasions (e.g. vs. Jurchens, Mongols, Japanese, Manchurians (later Jurchens), and even Western forces just from 1000s to 1900s) more than they did conquoring or attacking others (e.g. vs. Jurchens, Mongolian remainders). This history of defence of Korea made both North and South Korea all xenophobic and conservative. It‚Äôs not merely ‚Äúwe hate other cultures‚Äù but more like ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt trust others. Show us that you‚Äôre trustful if you want to be friends with us‚Äù. ‚Üí EXCLUSIVENESS MADE THROUGHOUT THEIR HISTORY (4) Japan: The exclusiveness of Japan is because of their geographic circumstance. As they‚Äôve lived in islands, they were quite isolated and developed highly unique culture compared to other East Asian countries. This is why setting the stereotype of East Asians as Japanese is improper, which is but done in especially the U.S. Anyway, as they‚Äôve been very isolated, they also sometimes insular to other cultures. But it‚Äôs quite subtly done that many people wouldn‚Äôt think so, because they usually don‚Äôt say what they think directly. In Japan, this exclusiveness is done in the form of ‚ÄúJapanizing‚Äù other cultures. However, once they judge that the exotic culture can become a part of their culture (iitokotori, „ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Å®„Åì„Å®„Çä: taking good things), then they take a quite inclusive and generous attitude towards the culture. ‚Üí EXCLUSIVENESS THAT GEOGRAPHICALLY OCCURED"},{"instruction":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","output":"One of the shrewdest and smartest maneuvers I have ever seen in business is when Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017.

Or are the odds so low that someone buying 1 ticket has the same chance essentially?","output":"The odds of winning Florida‚Äôs Lotto is 1 in 22,957,480. Drawings are held twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Let‚Äôs say you bought 100 tickets for every drawing. That‚Äôs 104 drawings, or 10,400 tickets, every year. If you did this starting on your 18th birthday and played until retirement at 65, that would be 488,800 tickets. That would give you a roughly 2% chance of winning one drawing. It‚Äôs not impossible to live to be 120. So, let‚Äôs say you buy 100 tickets for each drawing for 100 years. That‚Äôs just north of a million tickets. That puts you around 4.5%. Still not particularly impressive. It‚Äôs also a little deceptive. Each drawing is independent of all the others, meaning that you might win two or three times, assuming you keep playing. More than likely, though, you won‚Äôt win at all. Consider that if you stop when you retire, that would be 47 years of gambling. At 10,400 per year, you would have spent 488,800 on your tickets. Yes, you would get something back in winnings, either in the form of free tickets or small prizes. It probably won‚Äôt be enough to make that money back.

There are many varieties of Indian restaurant, even if a country has a different pallette. I got lucky early in life in that a couple of relatives are vegetarian. They would go to some really amazing Indian restaurants as they trusted the food. So I got to try out some of these great places in Manchester with my mother and Uncle Dave. From early on I got to try popadoms, Bombay duck, various wet curries, chicken tikka and some of those amazing Indian desserts. A lot of people think of curry and some kind of chicken napalm surprise which gets washed down with gallons of lager. There is so much variety. Ideally you want to try something that is typical of the cuisine and you can eat without pain. This is probably about 95% of most menus. If you want a real treat then a thali, which is a mixed tray of various small dishes. You get bread, rice to share amongst the various other plates on the tray. Small dishes help you take down a few flavours and then, when you come back, you can try more of that style or get to find your own feet. If you have a specific dietary requirement then Indian food is very respectful of that. I try and eat meat free a couple of times a week and love an Indian. Something like a starter or chick pea curry in a fried flat bread called a puri is great. Maybe even a few starters just to make a whole meal, like the thali. Indian breads are worth working your way through. Take the innocent naan bread. This goes from plain to chilli, from meat stuff to cheese and onion stuffed, garlic naan and peshwari with raisins and coconut. A crispy tubular, kind of pancake, called a dosa is a breakfast favourite of mine with a potato curry thrown up the centre. Lentil dishes, seafood, mutton, beef, cauliflower, okra, potatoes etc. Indian food, if you find the right places, can be very strong on a regional dish. There is a complete different between a Goan vindaloo (often pork) and one from elsewhere. The first one has some kind of Portugese translation which is different to other dishes and is quite pungent but not volcanic like the more well know vindaloo. One good tip I learned, real common sense, was to go dining with Indians. I have had some serious laughs and amazing food when someone else spots something they eat back in India."},{"instruction":"Do you think Mark Cuban would make a good POTUS?","output":"No liberal."},{"instruction":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","output":"Run, run faster, run even faster and not stop!

This is probably mostly because of the complexity of the tests especially as the courses get more advanced. Most classes exams were worth roughly 90% of your grade. Problem sets at most were worth 10%. They encouraged people to ‚Äúcollaborate‚Äù for the P sets, and lots of people including my would frequently just copy off of another student, but this was such a small part of the grade which was based on a curve anyway. However, what needs to be stressed is the structure and complexity of the exams. These aren‚Äôt multiple choice or one word or number answers not by a long shot. I was course 10, chemical engineering to non MIT people. Pretty much every single exam I took in the department was open books open notes. At first glance that might seem easy, but trust me, an open book open notes test is the hardest test you can take! They literally throw everything at you. How is it even possible to cheat? Your friend can‚Äôt whisper the answer either it would take them minutes just to explain and even if they could, it would be hard to even understand if you were lost. Even other departments without open book/notes tests the mere complexity of the questions makes it nearly impossible to copy an answer or have some sort of cheat sheet. Biochemistry wasn‚Äôt open book but you could bring a formula sheet and study guide. Answers were usually in individual blue books, and the work was how you got the credit. So once again very hard to cheat. People did try to game the system in other ways, however. Back in the day first year was pass/fail, everyone would try to take as many hard classes as possible so a C would be worth as much as an A. Lots of people would enroll in a introductory foreign language class in a language they were already quite fluent. Things like that occurred to artificially inflate your GPA.

You can check my earlier answers on mutual funds, many of which provide a list of best mutual funds for that month and the list is different almost every month. This happens because stock markets are very dynamic and stock prices depend on many factors. So selecting mutual funds is always going to be a difficult task, if we are focusing on the short term outcome. Returns average out over the long term - As your outlook is over 15 years, it is important to note over the long period, the returns of most categories of funds tend to move towards the average. In the equity segment, it is not only the timing or the selection but also the period of investment which is important. When you invest in a fund, you should wait for at least a year to see if the returns of the fund is higher than the average of that category or not. If it has been higher, continue to invest.

He is doing this from the past 5 years, without any help from others. He is not a rich person, but has been feeding the poor under the Dabeerpura flyover in Old Hyderabad from 2012. When asked what inspired him to do this goo deed, he responded that he himself knows what it is to go hungry, and wants no one to face the same situation. Azhar, owning a Plaster of Paris interior design business in Hyderabad, started feeding the poor when he first encountered a physically handicapped woman begging near the railway station in 2012. Initially, his wife used to cook food for around 15 people and he distributed it near the flyover daily at 1PM. Today he feeds nearly 150 people and spends nearly Rs.2500 daily from his pocket to feed the poor with 25 kg rice, 2 kg pulses, one liter of oil and spices and ensures no one goes hungry. Today, many of his friends have joined the cause. He says homeless people should be clothed and fed, not given money, since many of them use it to get drunk. Azhar plans to continue feeding the homeless, and ensure that anyone who comes to him gets at least one meal a day.

Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?","output":"The relationship between ancient Macedonia and Greece is a complex historical topic that has been a subject of scholarly debate and discussion. Ancient Macedonia was a region located in the northern part of the Greek peninsula, and it was home to the ancient Macedonian people, who were an ethno-linguistic group related to other ancient Greek city-states. The ancient Macedonian kingdom, under the rule of the Argead dynasty, rose to prominence in the 4th century BCE under the leadership of figures such as King Philip II and his son Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great went on to create a vast empire that extended from Greece to Egypt and India, spreading Greek culture and language across many regions. The relationship between ancient Macedonia and the rest of Greece is a complex issue due to various factors, including political, cultural, and linguistic aspects. Some scholars argue that the ancient Macedonians should be considered as Greeks, as they shared many cultural, linguistic, and religious similarities with other Greek city-states. Ancient Macedonian language was considered a dialect of Greek, and many aspects of Macedonian culture and religion were similar to those of other Greek city-states. However, there are also debates about the distinct identity of the ancient Macedonians, with some arguing that they had their own unique culture and were distinct from other Greek city-states. The issue of whether the ancient Macedonians were Greek or not is still a matter of scholarly discussion and interpretation, and opinions may vary among historians and researchers. It's important to note that the modern country of North Macedonia, which gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, is a separate nation from ancient Macedonia and modern Greece. The naming dispute between Greece and North Macedonia has been a complex issue, with Greece objecting to the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\" by its northern neighbor due to concerns over potential territorial claims and cultural appropriation. The issue was resolved through diplomatic negotiations, and in 2019, North Macedonia agreed to change its name to North Macedonia, which was accepted by Greece. In summary, the relationship between ancient Macedonia and Greece is a complex historical topic, and opinions may vary among scholars. While the ancient Macedonians shared many cultural and linguistic similarities with other Greek city-states, the issue of their identity as Greeks or a distinct culture is still a matter of scholarly debate. It's important to consider the historical and cultural context and consult reputable sources for a comprehensive understanding of this topic.

Yes, automation can result in a loss of hand flying skills, or worse, can hide the lack of them, but in general hand flying is still the norm when flying arrivals and departures, which tend to be the more demanding (but not more exhausting) phases of a flight. What we gain by having the FMS, autopilot, and autothrottles is well worth the price. Not having to hand fly the aircraft at the flight levels makes it easier to stay ahead of the aircraft, monitor the progress of the flight, make considered decisions regarding weather deviations, and deal with mechanical issues.

Gun rights, only those who need a gun, can prove fitness, crime free, medically and mentally sound, following a police check, with proper storage, insurance, and training, and then simple weapons, hunting rifle, revolver, or basic shotgun for pest control, target shooting, certain other circumstances. Otherwise join the Army, and they're even more restrictive on who gets one, especially with bullets. Upside is that we had 0 mass shootings in June.

Workers can use it as a platform to perform jobs, move supplies, and access elevated regions.

Here are some tips to make your first date Authenticity is key. Pretending to be someone you're not won't lead to a genuine connection. Be honest and let your date get to know the real you. Pick a location that allows for conversation and interaction. A cozy cafe, a park, or a casual restaurant are good options. Avoid loud or crowded places that might make it difficult to talk. Dress in a way that makes you feel confident and comfortable. It's important to make a good impression, but don't overdo it. Dress according to the venue and the activity you have planned. Being on time shows that you respect your date's time and are eager to meet them. If you anticipate being late, let them know in advance. Pay attention to what your date is saying and show genuine interest. Ask questions and engage in the conversation. This demonstrates that you care about getting to know them. Be present and avoid distractions. Keep your phone on silent or in your pocket, so you're not tempted to check it constantly. Keep the conversation light and positive. Avoid talking about past relationships, controversial topics, or negative experiences. Focus on getting to know each other's interests and hobbies. While it's good to share information about yourself, avoid oversharing personal or sensitive details on the first date. Save deeper discussions for later when you've built more trust. Nonverbal cues can speak volumes. Maintain eye contact, smile, and use open body language to convey that you're open and interested. Treat your date with kindness and respect. Be polite to everyone you encounter during the date, including waitstaff and others. If things are going well, it's okay to extend the date, but it's also fine to keep it short and leave room for anticipation for the next meeting. Let the conversation flow naturally. Don't pressure your date or yourself to make immediate decisions about the future of the relationship. Not every first date leads to a second one, and that's okay. If you feel there's no connection, be polite and honest about your feelings. Remember that first dates are about getting to know each other and seeing if there's potential for a deeper connection. Stay relaxed, be yourself, and have fun!"},{"instruction":"Do you continue to greet neighbors who never say hello first?","output":"Do I continue to greet neighbors who never say hello first (or how about never say hello) ?

Any attempt to minimize or maximize the number of lines of code will happen at the expense of one or more other desirable qualities of the code, such as correctness, readability, testability, maintainability, etc. I can easily take a class hierarchy and increase the total number of lines of code by moving code from parent classes to all of the child classes. It‚Äôll be duplicated in each of them rather than shared through the parent class. At the other end of the spectrum, I can make most code shorter, within limits. There are almost always some intermediate variables that can be eliminated, at the expense of clarity. Lines of code can be a useful metric. You can gauge how much effort you‚Äôre going to have to expend to do some work based on the size of the relevant portion of the codebase.

If you want to build muscles & lose fat, then you need to eat lean protein or complete protein foods, where all the essential amino acids are present. Lean protein foods are those foods in which the quantity of protein content is high as compared to other nutritions like carbs and fats. For non-veg peoples there are many food options like meat, fish and other animal sources to get enough of lean protein. Now here in case of vegetarians, you can also get enough of protein from the your diet. But with protein you will also get some amount of carbs and fats. One good thing is that you will get a good amount of fiber from your vegetarian diet. So, keeping that in my mind, I have shared some top and best vegetarian foods which is rich in protein, low in calories, carbs & fats, which will really help in muscle building & weight loss. ‚Ä¢ Soy chunks In 100 grams of soy chunks it contains 52 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Kidney beans In 100 grams of cooked kidney beans it contains 9 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Chickpeas In 100 grams of boiled chickpeas it contains 9 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Black chickpeas (kale channe) In 100 grams of boiled kale channe, it contains 9 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Lentils (Daal) In 100 grams of lentils, it contains approx 9 grams of protein ‚Ä¢ Tofu/soy paneer In 100 grams of tofu, it contains 10 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Skimmed milk / low-fat milk In 100 ml of skimmed milk, it contains 3 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Greek yoghurt In 100 grams of yoghurt, it contains 10 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Panner In 100 grams of panner, it contains 21.4 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Mushrooms In 100 grams of mushroom, it contains 3.1 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Quinoa In 100 grams of quinoa, it contains 4.4 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Green peas In 100 grams of green peas, it contains 5 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Flaxseeds In 100 grams of flaxseeds, it contains 18 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Chia seeds In 100 grams of chia seeds, it contains 17 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Hemp seeds In 100 grams of hemp seeds, it contains 32 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Sunflower seeds In 100 grams of sunflower seeds, it contains 21 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Almonds In 100 grams of almonds, it contains 21 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Cashews In 100 grams of cashews, it contains 18 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Peanuts In 100 grams of peanut, it contains 26 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Walnuts In 100 grams of walnuts, it contains 15 grams of protein. ‚Ä¢ Oats In 100 grams of oats, it contains 16 grams of protein. If you are a vegetarian just add all these top foods in your daily diet to fulfil the needs of protein. If you can‚Äôt eat all those protein-rich foods or if you are not getting enough of protein from your diet, then you need to add protein supplements in your diet to fulfil the daily needs of protein. The daily requirement of protein depends on your physical activity and for more information please read here:- [LINKED_TEXT: List of top 10 vegetarian protein-rich foods in India with proper chart] [URL: https://fitnessinfotips.com/vegetarian-protein-rich-foods/] Please upvote, if you are helpful.

I was at a street food festival in my town about 10 years ago with my young son (then aged around six), which featured a chilli stall, with an array of about twenty chilli sauces in little pots with small cubes of bread on the side to dip and taste. They were clearly labelled, left to right, as mild to lethal. Being rather partial to chilli, I was browsing the exotic range of sauces, when I was distracted by an acquaintance who had stopped for a chat. When he left, I returned to the stall and‚Ä¶ started accidentally from the wrong end, taking a large dollop of the ‚Äúlethal‚Äù sauce. My head exploded. I was left breathless, coughing and spluttering, and in considerable pain. I remember grabbing my son‚Äôs ice-cream and cramming it into my face. The effect subsided after about ten minutes, and I bought my son - who seemed unsure whether to be appalled or amused at the strange antics of his dad - another ice-cream. He still remembers it too - last year, for my birthday, he bought me a bottle of something called ‚ÄúMad Dog Inferno‚Äù.

This means that Angular provides a more modern and flexible approach to application development.Language: AngularJS uses JavaScript for development, while Angular uses TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that includes additional features like static typing, making it easier to write and maintain complex applications.Performance: Angular is designed to be faster and more efficient than AngularJS, thanks to features like the Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and a more optimized change detection mechanism.Size: Angular is a larger framework than AngularJS, which means that it may take longer to learn and set up. However, Angular's larger size also means that it provides more built-in features and functionality.Syntax: Angular's syntax has changed significantly from AngularJS, which means that developers will need to learn a new syntax to work with Angular. Overall, Angular provides a more modern and flexible approach to application development, with better performance and a more optimized change detection mechanism. However, AngularJS may still be a good choice for smaller applications or projects that require a simpler architecture and syntax."},{"instruction":"What are the requirements for Amazon FBA in India?","output":"The requirements for using Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) in India might still be subject to change, so it's essential to verify the latest information on the official Amazon website or contact Amazon seller support directly.

Transduction is reasoning from observed, specific (training) cases to specific (test) cases. Let us understand this from the perspective of machine learning- Inductive learning is nothing but the principle behind the supervised machine learning algorithms where a model tries to build a relationship between the feature variables and target variable by examining the hidden patterns in the train data. Although the model is exposed to a restricted scope of the training data, the learning of the model will be according to a generic nature of data such that it can predict the value of any data point from an unlabelled dataset (test dataset). This kind of learning is termed inductive learning. It is to be noted here that the model is not exposed to the test data during the learning phase and is only provided with the training data for the learning purpose. In transductive learning, both training and testing data set is exposed to the model in the learning phase itself. The model tries to find any information about the pattern in the combined dataset (training + testing) and later uses this information for predicting the values of the unlabelled testing data points. Let us see an example for both of them- Example ‚Äì Inductive learning Imagine that we have a classification problem in which we have to predict whether a person is a male or female. We have a training dataset like this ‚Äì The green-colored circles are labeled as men and red-colored circles are labeled as women. We have trained a machine learning model to this data and later the test data points were introduced. The blue-colored circles are the test data points- Since the model is already got trained with a machine learning algorithm, we can use that model to predict these unseen data points. We got the results like these- This is nothing but a classic example of Inductive learning. Example ‚Äì Transductive learning Let us consider that we have a semi-supervised problem to predict whether a person is male or female. The problem with semi-supervised learning is that all of the data points in the dataset will not be labeled. Imagine that our data points look like this- Here, we can see that some of the data points are labeled as men (green color) and some of the data points are labeled as women (red color) but there are some data points that remain unlabelled (white color). Instead of splitting data as training and testing set as an inductive learning approach, we can build a model in the entire dataset using all the available data points (labeled and unlabelled). There are several algorithms for this purpose like label propagation, label spreading, Partitioning transduction, Agglomerative transduction, etc. Let us look at the pseudo-code of agglomerative transduction algorithm- Finally, we will get the output like this- Hence, we were able to label all the unlabelled data points. In summary- Inductive learning trains the model with labeled data points and tries to predict the label of unlabeled data points. However, transductive learning trains the entire data set and tries to predict the label of unlabeled data points.In inductive learning, if a new unlabelled data point is getting introduced then we can use the already trained model for the prediction. However, in transductive learning, we may need to retrain the entire model.Transductive learning is computationally expensive than inductive learning.

It can also be converted into defects per million opportunities (which is the failure rate x 1,000,000), which can also be converted into a sigma level. If the process has measurable/continuous data, such as weight, dimensions, thickness, viscosity, electrical properties, concentration, financial costs, time to complete (mins, hours, days), etc, then it can be measured with average (mean) and standard deviation. If there are specification limits for what is acceptable, then the average and standard deviation can be measured against limits or expectations to determine capability (Cpk/Ppk). This can also be converted into defective parts per million or a sigma level. Bottom line, measuring the success rate of quality or delivery is feasible for most processes, but if you can measure something tangible about the requirements of that process, that‚Äôs ideal and allows for more analysis techniques."},{"instruction":"Should farmers be prohibited from owning guns?","output":"No but you should be prohibited from posting questions!

The story of the Miller of Mansfield was first performed as a play in London in 1737, but probably dates back to the time of Henry II who reigned from 1154 to 1189. His son was Richard I or Richard the Lionheart. His brother was the infamous King John (1199 to 1215), who notoriously made life quite difficult for Robin Hood. The story goes that King Henry II was dirty and tired having become separated from his party after a day‚Äôs hunting in Sherwood Forest. The ruins of King John‚Äôs hunting lodge can still be found in Kings Clipstone, which is a few miles from Mansfield, showing that Kings did indeed do their hunting in the area. He finally found refuge on the outskirts of Mansfield with a miller named John Cockle, who did not recognise the King due to his dirty hunting attire, and kindly offered the traveller a bed for the night. The miller‚Äôs wife fed the King an amazing venison pie, made from one of the deer roaming around the forest; the property of the King. The following morning, the King‚Äôs entourage arrived, thus revealing his true royal identity. Legend has it that King Henry pretended to be angry with John and his wife, threatening to behead them for poaching his deer. However, instead of chopping off John‚Äôs head, he tapped the miller on each shoulder with the sword, knighting him. Two Mansfield pubs are named after the legend - The John Cockle and the King and Miller. The local hospital is named Kings Mill.

My view is that overall it is one of the most balanced papers in the UK, but that does gloss over the fact that in individual areas it leans further to the left or to the right."},{"instruction":"Are school clubs, MUN, and volunteering enough extra curricular to get into Harvard?","output":"No , no Harvard."},{"instruction":"Can universal moral values be established?","output":"It‚Äôs been tried for millenia, but human nature always gets in the way."},{"instruction":"As an American, do you agree that statistics that show the US way down low at #37 for quality of healthcare is farleft propaganda that folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand love to repeat, when in reality the US is always #1?","output":"A percentage of Americans get good healthcare on a sliding scale, the rest get crap on a sliding scale!"},{"instruction":"w do homosexuals decide who is the alpha; coin toss?","output":"You mean who gets to stick it in the other?.

Elgar in his short scores was pretty much able to fit everything in onto two staves. Many contemporary composers don' t make short scores but go straight into fullscore. My RCM composition professor had pretty strong views about this modern practice, mind! He believed that it led to several cases of incompetence and certain composers not being actually able to ‚Äúhear‚Äù what they write. When I compose orchestral music, I start off with a ‚Äúsketch\\", then I work jointly on making a short score and fullscore side by side. My reasons are that I like to conceive the instruments having an interesting part to play, and a fullscore better shows them individually unfolding. However, a simultaneous short score helps me better to see the harmonic spacing and work on the predominant unfolding ‚Äúline\\". This is important (for me) because, were I to go solely into fullscore, it would be easy to go off at a tangent on secondary lines and so be diverted from the primary musical argument. Everyone' s different, though!"},{"instruction":"What watt should a bulb be for a kitchen?","output":"That depends on the kitchen.

They will incorporate sensor fusion, deep learning neural nets, along with high definition maps to accomplish full autonomy. The thousands of cars they sell to customers today will collect vast quantities of real-world driving data that will be used to enhance the accuracy and reliability of their software until full self-driving capability is accomplished.

They can only be rented, and the cost of renting one varies depending on the specific model and the duration of the rental. However, it is estimated that the cost of renting an IMAX camera can range from INR 12,00,000 to INR 16,00,000 per week. This is just for the body of the camera, not including lenses, film, or other accessories. It is also worth noting that IMAX cameras are very large and heavy, and require specialized equipment to transport and operate. This means that you will need to hire a crew of experienced professionals to help you use the camera, which will add to the overall cost of production. In short, IMAX cameras are very expensive to rent and use. They are only suitable for large-budget productions with a team of experienced professionals. If you are looking to shoot a low-budget film, you will be better off using a more affordable camera system."},{"instruction":"What are the main differences between musicals and operas?","output":"Voice technics are different.

Today, I wish to impart my knowledge to you on how to earn a monthly income of 1,000 even without initial skills, prior experience, or seed capital. I‚Äôll focus on the point that this is the age of information, making the creation of a digital business far easier than starting one in the industrial age. To illustrate my point, I‚Äôll discuss two areas: how starting is often the most difficult part, and the ways to tackle obstacles and challenges on the journey. The Hardest Thing is to Actually Get Started One of the prominent roadblocks to launching an internet venture is the initial step. Many aspiring entrepreneurs find it challenging to begin due to fear of failure, are not confident enough, or feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available. Nevertheless, when you begin, you‚Äôll rapidly discover that there‚Äôs an abundance of resources and possibilities to help you succeed. To initiate, you must pinpoint your enthusiasm or area of interest. In this age of knowledge, there‚Äôs a market for almost everything. Your unique outlook and knowledge can be of value to others, so don‚Äôt be afraid to share it. After you‚Äôve selected a niche, study your intended audience to understand their needs and preferences better. Such information can help you adapt your product or service to accommodate their necessities. Next, create a simple business plan sketching out your objectives, tactics, and the steps you must take to succeed. This blueprint will function as your navigation tool and keep you focused on your objectives. Keep in mind, it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect; you can always adjust it as you move forward. Overcoming Hurdles and Challenges Launching a venture comes with its share of challenges, but being willing to confront them directly is crucial for your success. Here are some common hurdles you may confront and strategies to surmount them: 1 - Fear of Failure: The fear of failure is normal, but it shouldn‚Äôt discourage you. Embrace the possibility of failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Keep in mind that even the most successful businesspeople have met with failure at some point in their path. 2 - Limited Skills or Experience: The digital age offers a multitude of resources for learning and developing new skills. Utilize online courses, guides, and communities to acquire the knowledge you need. As you advance, you‚Äôll gain more confidence in your abilities. 3 - Lack of Capital: Even though initiating an online business typically requires less capital than a traditional brick-and-mortar venture, wise financial management is still crucial. Search for economical options like free or budget-friendly applications and software to help you get started. You can also consider partnering with individuals possessing complementary skills or resources. 4 - Procrastination: It‚Äôs easy to become overwhelmed by the numerous tasks associated with launching a business. To tackle procrastination, break your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on finishing one task at a time, and commemorate your progress along the way. 5 - Staying Motivated: Preserving motivation can be difficult, particularly when dealing with setbacks or slow progress. Surround yourself with supportive friends, family, or mentors who can provide inspiration and advice. Constantly remind yourself of your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù ‚Äì the initial motivation behind starting your business. 6 - Adapting to Change: The digital business environment is constantly evolving, so it‚Äôs vital to stay updated and be prepared to adapt. Keep a watch on industry trends, competitors, and novel technologies that could potentially impact your business. Be prepared to shift your strategies when necessary. 7 - Balancing Business and Personal Life: Starting a business can be draining and demanding Yet, it‚Äôs vital to uphold a healthy balance between work and life. Set boundaries and form a routine that lets you assign time for both your work and personal life. Confirm to arrange routine breaks, workouts, and socializing to avoid burnout. To conclude: The era of digital information presents a wealth of opportunities for aspiring businesspeople to start and grow a successful online business. The trick is to make that initial move and be prepared to face the challenges that come your way. By identifying your passion, developing a robust plan, and continuously learning and adapting, you can overcome hurdles and construct a business that yields 1,000 per month or more. Bear in mind, as an entrepreneur who has built multiple successful online businesses, I can confirm that these steps have been successful for me and many others. There‚Äôs no universal recipe for success, but with determination, persistence, and the right mindset, you can also reach your goals. Now, it‚Äôs time to take action. Embark on your entrepreneurial journey by finding your passion and conducting thorough research on your target audience. Create a simple but effective business plan and initiate the process of mastering the required skills to make your venture a success. Embrace the challenges and obstacles that come your way, and never disregard your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. In the information age, the prospects for success are boundless, and with the proper approach, you can build a thriving online business that backs your preferred lifestyle.

Here I am providing you a brief analysis of Zeal test series on different parameters. ¬∑ Quality of questions ¬∑ Cost ¬∑ Number of students who registered for test series ¬∑ No delay in updation and correction of answers & questions ¬∑ GUI Quality of questions. In zeal test series there are questions from basic to advance level, such that you can cover all corners of each topic of the subjects. The level of the questions for the subjects like Computer Networks, DBMS, OS, TOC, CSO is very good as compared to other test series. Other subjects are also strong. Answers and solutions are more accurate than other tests series. Cost Cost is low as compared to all the other test series and of number of tests are also nearly about 75, which is comparatively a greater number than other series. Number of Students Number of students registered are less as compared to other test series as much people don‚Äôt know about Zeal Test series. Updation of the Answers and Solutions If there is any updation in any questions or answers, they are updated as soon as any need of change is encountered. Whereas other test series such as made easy does not even update their solutions and answers. GUI GUI is not as good as other.

Whenever I have these type gripes I like to pop the hood on a dark night then start the car. If you see arcing and sparking that's your problem. Some of these coils have springs in the bottom that the current passes through. I've seen these corroded so bad they cause misfires. Just remember a misfire is an interruption of the ignition current. This is possible if there's a short like a hole in a wire allowing th current an easier path to ground. This is what I look for at night. The spark of that arc where it gets grounded. The other way is too much resistance the current can't pass. That's the corrosion scenario. The ultimate resistance is an open.. This is same as if you cut the wire and the circuit can't complete itself. So knowing this can help you. Same principle holds true for coils. To test if you have a bad coil just switch it with another. If the gripe moves then you have your proof. Good luck.

It's more than just having someone to hang out with or talk to when you're bored. Friendship is a special relationship that is built on trust, mutual respect, and support. So, what's the real meaning of friendship? Here are a few key points to keep in mind: Trust: Trust is the foundation of any friendship. You need to trust your friend to be honest with you, to keep your secrets, and to have your back no matter what. Without trust, there can be no real friendship.Mutual Respect: Friends respect each other's beliefs, opinions, and values, even if they don't always agree. You don't have to have the same interests or opinions to be friends, but you do need to respect each other.Support: Friends are there for each other through thick and thin. They offer support and encouragement when things are tough, and they celebrate each other's successes. They're not just there for the good times, but for the bad times too.Fun: Friendship is also about having fun together. Whether it's going out for a night on the town or just hanging out and watching a movie, friends know how to have a good time together. In the end, the real meaning of friendship is about having someone who you can count on, who makes you feel good about yourself, and who you can be yourself around. It's a special bond that should be cherished and nurtured, because true friends are hard to come by."},{"instruction":"the MIT Pune good for a B.Tech?","output":"Mit WPU Ranks in the top institute for B.Tech and is ranked 7th best Private Institute for Engineering in India ,as per the Times Engineering Survey 2020 and 2nd in the top private Engineering Institute Rankings 2020 for west zone by Times Engineering Survey .

On top of that, the price can get really expensive because of how rare it is. Some meteorites will have different material compositions that are rarely found on earth. This determines the price of the meteorite. 5. Bur-Abor (600,000-800,000) The rock which is known as Bur-Abor is a meteorite specimen found in Kenya in 1997. It was sold in Los Angeles in May 2021 at the Bonhams auction with a hefty price tag of 600,000 - 800,000. 4. Conception Junction (775,299.24) The Conception Junction meteorite was found in 2006 near the same city as its name with a population of only 202 people. One farmer found this rock buried under a mountain and finally brought it to an archeologist from Washington University, St Louis stating that the rock is rarely found and worth 750,000. 3. Brenham (934,680.32) The Brenham meteorite fell onto earth around 20,000 years ago and was found in Kiowa County, Kansas in 1882. This rock is another pallasite that is formed from metal rock. When cut, the pallasite exposes shiny olivin crystal(also known as peridot) that has been formed inside the rock. 2. Willamette (1,100,000 - 1,300,000) The Williamette Meteorite is a 15.5-tonne meteorite that is made from metal with a medium octahedrite configuration. This meteorite has a smooth touch on it since the surface melts as it enters our atmosphere. 1. Fukang (1,773,593) It was found in the year 2000 at the Fukand Mountain and is also a pallasite type meteorite made from metal rocks with the formation of olivin crystals or magnesium silicate. The structure is arranged in what is called a nickel-based metal matrix."},{"instruction":"Why are expensive private middle and high schools worth it?

He had been a bully magnet in before this, there was no bullying at this school. He was able to take 12 AP courses, something that would not have been possible in the public schools. Were the teachers any better? Well, some had PhDs but even a teacher with just a BA can do a lot when classes are smaller. I should point out that the pay wasn‚Äôt any better than in the public schools."},{"instruction":"w is HTTPS any more secure than HTTP if literally anyone can implement it?","output":"The security of SSL rests on a foundation of four pillars. The security of the protocols and ciphers. The details of these are all public information and are highly scrutinized by professionals in both the academic and commercial sectors.The security of the stacks that implement the protocols and ciphers. Most of these are open source and are subject to the same level of scrutiny as the underlying protocols and ciphers. The ones that aren‚Äôt are supported by companies that we (mostly) trust to have the expertise to design, implement and maintain this software. We should not, and do not, trust ‚Äúliterally anyone‚Äù to build these stacks.The security of the certificate authorities that issue the unique cryptographic certificates that every system that provides SSL connections rely on for their public and private keys. This is a potential weakpoint, but there have been relatively few breaches of CAs ‚Äî as far as we know. The fact that there are many such CAs provides resilience for the overall SSL security ecosystem, as switching providers remedies any one breach. There are two important checks on who can implement a public CA that serves to increase our confidence in them. The first is simply the free market. People won‚Äôt patronize a public CA that isn‚Äôt trusted. The second is the major browser manufacturers, who will not distribute the public keys needed to validate certificates from a CA that they do not consider trustworthy. They can also invalidate certificates from any CA that is breached by pushing out an update to the browser.The security of the servers that are providing the SSL connections, and of the people who administer them. This is the weakest link. A properly managed server will always have at least one extra layer of passwords to get through in order to protect its certificates, and properly-trained administrators will never keep those passwords anywhere that could be accessible but administrators are humans and do make mistakes, and someone who has gained total control of a server can, in theory, and if they wait long enough, always get the password the next time it has to be typed in."},{"instruction":"Are atoms observable?

There is a common misconception that microwave cooking is bad for your health, but in reality, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Microwave ovens work by emitting microwave radiation, which excites the water molecules in food, causing them to vibrate and generate heat. This heat cooks the food. The microwaves used in ovens are non-ionizing radiation, which means they do not have enough energy to cause ionization or damage DNA. In terms of nutrient loss, any cooking method can result in some nutrient reduction due to factors such as heat, water, and exposure to air. However, microwave cooking is generally considered to be one of the best methods for preserving nutrients compared to other methods like boiling or frying. Because microwave cooking is faster and requires less water, it helps retain more nutrients in the food. It's important to note that certain types of packaging, such as plastic containers or plastic wrap, can release harmful chemicals when heated in a microwave. To avoid this, it's recommended to use microwave-safe containers or coverings, or transfer the food to microwave-safe dishes before heating. Overall, when used properly and following recommended guidelines, microwave ovens are a safe and convenient way to cook food. As with any cooking method, it's essential to practice good food hygiene and ensure that food is heated to the appropriate temperature to kill bacteria and prevent foodborne illnesses. from below product you can get more information click here [LINKED_TEXT: Healthy HabitsDiscover the secrets revealed inside Healthy Habits with more clarity so you can easily implement the action steps.Experience personal guidance as you have a voice that speaks to you, guides you, and grabs your attention with visual graphics.https://www.digistore24.com/redir/447066/Tharindu0987/] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/447066/Tharindu0987/]"},{"instruction":"Why did Will Smith slap his costar at the Oscars?","output":"Because he felt he had to do something.

By that I mean, use the radiation directly without so many conversions, i.e. radiationheatsteammechanicalelectricty?","output":"Because it turns out that the radiation energy output from nuclear fission is just 3.5% of the total energy released. The remaining and therefore vast majority of energy is released as kinetic energy of the fission fragments, and of course kinetic energy in atomic particles is just heat. In any case when the radiation in the form of gamma photons hits the surrounding atoms the result is more heat energy, so you get the extra 3.5% added in for free. So heat is actually the starting point of nuclear fission in energy terms, just like a power station that burns ordinary fuel. And of course the best way we have of converting large quantities of heat to electricity is via steam turbine. The way to increase the efficiency of conversion of this heat to mechanical energy is by increasing the temperature and pressure of the fluid extracting the heat from the core. This is the principle behind the fourth generation supercritical water reactor (SCWR) for example, creating steam at 500ÀöC and 250 atm pressure."},{"instruction":"w can you nominate Anthony Fauci for the Nobel Prize in either peace or medicine?","output":"In my humble opinion client Anthony Fauci was scapegoated by Trump and his crew.

They come in all shapes and sizes, depending on the gun and the task. Bullets designed for handguns are fundamentally different than those designed for rifles. Bullets designed for defense are different from those designed for target shooting. Bullets designed for hunting varmints are different from those designed for hunting big, dangerous game. Competitors who shoot mid-range (600 yards) or long-range (1,000 yards) spend a lot of time working up bullets that have the greatest ballistic coeficient -- a factor of the bullet's weight, diameter and shape. Bullets with a higher ballistic coeficient are more aerodynamiclly efficient and have trajectories that are much flatter, and are less affected by wind and other forces. The shape of the point is a critical factor, but the most efficient shape is not necessaril the \\"pointiest.\\" In fact, many \\"match\\" bullets designed for high-powered rifles often have a tiny hollow in the tip, because it shifts a tiny amount of weight away from the nose of the bullet and back toward the middle. This is entirely different from handgun bullets that use hollow points to improve bullet expansion. Varmint hunters who want to hit pint-sized rodents at 400 yards have similar concerns -- they want very lightweight (40-50 grain), small projectiles that will move very fast (3,500-4,000 fps) and shoot very flat. The impact of such projectiles is almost explosive in nature. OTOH, hunters going after Cape Buffalo have entirely different needs. Penetration through heavy bone and muscle is the name of the game. The minimum cartridge is generally considered to be a .375 H&H Magnum, with a 300-grain bullet traveling at about 2,600 fps. The bullets are generally round-nosed so that they will not break apart on impact and penetrate more deeply. Also, consider that most modern bullets are jacketed, meaning that they have a core of lead covered by a thin layer of harder copper alloy. That makes it possible to design more efficient \\"pointy\\" bullets. Solid lead bullets must have blunter profiles because they are much softer."},{"instruction":"What items are not allowed in checked baggage on Emirates Airlines?","output":"hippo/ rhino/ ocean/ mountain/ coconut tree are not allowed.

Lol. The Reason for that is, I have been to three different countries (excluding India) and had tried Indian food there. They are all different and none of them are even close to what the REAL Indian food taste like. Said that, if you really wanna try and WANT TO LIKE Indian food, then again it depends on what are your preferences in food. E.g. Some people think that they can handle the spicy food. But in India Spicy need not only means hotter, but it could also mean that it has lots and lots of spices. Sometimes it is difficult to handle (rather harsh on the stomach if you are not used to) and you would end of making an impression that Indian food gives you a bad morning. So my suggestions are as below: If you like sweets go for Basundi, KheerIf you hotter food (not spicier) and like rice items then go for Biryanis. In India, non-veg is not always the only option. You may want to try the vegetarian food as well.If you like spicier food go for north Indian food like Mughalai or Tandoori.If you want to try the non-spicier food but still Indian touch, then go for Idli-sambhar/Masala Dosa/Uttapam etc.If you want to try a full DISH with everything little in it go for Maharashtrian Thali (This contains rice, naan, two veggies, chutney, papad etc)If you want to go for the milder version of above go for Gujrati Food. Gujrati food is also known to be very tasty (but most of the items are snacky rather than actual meal type) So I think you see that there are lots of options. Choose the one wisely ;)"},{"instruction":"Which do you prefer, dubbed movies or subtitled movies?","output":"‚ÄúSubtitled‚Äù Dubbed movies make you comfortable with your preferable language while subtitled movies are difficult to watch.

If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.‚Äù‚Äï Stephen King, Writing is about taking action. Taking action is paramount. Write daily. If you are stuck on what to write, grab a book or any other work and copy the writing, word-by-word. Pay attention to how the writing is structured, the sentences, the words. Think about how the writing makes you feel. Write daily. Write emails, letters, poems, articles, essays, journal entries, answers on Quora, posts on social media. Anything.

It is mandatory. Why is that? Because if it were not mandatory, students might not do what they are commanded to do. It requires from ten to twenty years to achieve its goals. Why is that? Ben Franklin and Charles Dickens and Mark Twain and Thomas Edison went to school for a couple of years -- back when it was not mandatory. Students are required to learn a great many things which have no practical value and will not be used for the rest of their life (except for school). Why is that? They must go to certain classes and study what they are told, get up when the bell rings and go on to other classes where they must study what they are told. Why is that? Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations explains why teachers will never do a good job in a system like ours. To have the proper conditions for good teaching, they must be paid directly and individually by each student, and if they do not please the student by doing as the student wishes, the student may fire them. Poor teachers would be driven out of the profession. As it is, taxpayers are forced (mandatory again) to pay for the schools, not parents or students. The schools then pay the teachers, good or bad, and generally are unable to fire them (and have no wish to do so). As Smith explains, in such a system, teachers will do as little as possible -- agreeing with each other to make the job as easy as they can. This is certainly true of university teaching, while lower level public schools generally substitute rigid methods that require teachers to exhaust themselves doing a great many things, often with little regard for individual students or what works. I often tell my pupils your intent behind mandatory, fragmented, basic education this is certainly intensely dull (generally) and can be taught by teachers which often graduated at the end of the university course (and not from the most readily useful colleges) is that students are now being trained to be workers -- to get to work at a specific time each day, to-do work which will not attention them, to complete what they're told by people who are in a position of authority. To fully condition future bureaucrats needs a long time of monotony. a proper training pays awareness of the needs of the individual. My son, on age of two, ended up being fascinated with vehicles. He understood the names of maybe one hundred different vehicles and could recognize them by their logos. As he ended up being five, he liked location and understood not merely most of the nations worldwide, but additionally their particular capitals and areas. School will not permit this sort of focus. If it performed, an individual might ponder over it becoming helpful knowledge. As it's, i really believe it really is of use mostly for instruction individuals do as they are told and accept their particular place in the machine. Comenius, one of the planet's best educators, stated we must teach individuals utilizing a technique (if my memory does not fail me personally) that is pleasant, simple, and comprehensive. I don't believe that describes our current system whatsoever."},{"instruction":"Why would Klobuchar, Buttigieg, and Steyers drop out before seeing how they do on Super Tuesday?","output":"I don‚Äôt know about Steyer, apart from the fact that he was self funding, without any success at all, and maybe he was tired of throwing money at a losing cause, but for both Buttigieg and Klobuchar, they have their political futures to consider, and dropping out of an obviously losing race and throwing in with the candidate who the Democratic establishment has selected (as opposed to Senator Sanders) is obviously in their best interests."},{"instruction":"Does Canada feel animosity towards the Trump administration for the threats and tariffs of the last two years?","output":"Not sure, Canada has been like a dog that comes in my yard and eats my dog‚Äôs food.

She looked nothing like me or other members of my family. My daughter has very dark skin. Her mother was never a serious part of her life. On days when her mother was supposed to pick her up and spend time with her, my daughter would get dressed-up and excited and her mom was a ‚Äúno-show‚Äù. I would make up some excuse for her mom not showing up. And on birthdays and Christmas, I would always place a gift under the tree and address it from her mom. As she got older, her appearance got more defined and had nothing in common with me or my family. Her skin got darker and her lips thicker and her hair curlier. There were always the questions from family and friends and the usual gossip in our hometown. One day, when she was 15 years old, she sat down next to me as I was working on my laptop. She said ‚ÄúDaddy, may I ask you a question?‚Äù I continued what I was doing and simply replied, ‚ÄúSure, sweetie, what‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúDaddy, would you like me to take a DNA test?‚Äù That hit me real hard so I stopped what I was doing, closed my laptop and faced her.

My grandmother and her sister both died of Alzheimer‚Äôs. Both spent their last months in a care facility. Both, in their minds, were experiencing something that happened earlier in their lives. My grandfather attended to both of them since my grandmother‚Äôs sister was a widow. Nothing he told them stuck with them as reality, the only thing that was real was their memories from decades earlier. My grandmother believed she was a little girl again, experiencing the idilic life she remembered from living in south west China. She was singing songs in Chinese (sorry I don‚Äôt know which of the two) a language she had forgotten 75 years earlier. She was happy, and a nice old man (her husband) came to visit almost every day. No one could convince her of anything but her delusion. Fortunately it was a happy one. Her sister was not so fortunate. She had been a missionary somewhere in Africa, I believe. She was there during a significant conflict, had been captured and imprisoned for some time. During her time in captivity she was raped and otherwise abused. This was the memory her mind reverted to. She believed the care facility was the prison camp, and the aid workers the guards. Nothing we could say would shake her delusion. What stayed, was her character. When we visited with our children she had one concern, that we safely get our daughter out of there before she was abused. Thankfully death and peace came to her eventually."},{"instruction":"What do civil engineers do after graduating if they don't get a placement?","output":"This is the question which almost every Civil Engineering graduates face after there course, as a Civil Engineer myself i will explain in detail what to do. First of all, face the truth! Civil Engineering is a course with very little scope and requires immense patience to succeed, thanks to the current economy and frustrating rules and policies. Second, there can be a construction boom any moment from now since the government has loosened up and are starting up massive Infrastructure and smart city projects across the country, and incoming of foreign investments too, but it's still only a hope. So whoever is considering to take up the course, i would say kindly rethink on other options. If you got trapped already, then welcome, let's fight the challenges. Step 1 - Forget your pride and ego, join a small private group, Contractors and small developers will gladly accept you for a minimal wage,(and some for free), kick start your career. Don't be adamant on your pay, your experience is the saviour. There are 2 options, either a Site Engineer which has a way more scope or in a design field, which has lesser Vacancies but a good one. Step 2 - After some experience, try hard to enter a medium-firm, who accepts staffs with a minimum of 2 years of experience. You need to keep applying for jobs almost every day as soon as you start your first day on the job. You become lazy, you lose an opportunity. Step 3 - Once you are done with 4 to 6 years of experience in the field, your career will come to a stable situation. But again that doesn't mean you are fully secured, you might lose your job any moment since these companies do cost-cutting almost every year. So you need to do a proper financial planning as you work, secure yourself as soon as you start earning, that would be really helpful. Apart from the private jobs, let's talk about the crowd favourite, The Government Jobs!! If you have an immense amount of self-confidence and determination that you can crack exams, then go for it as soon as you pass out. Else don't keep fake hopes, you won't crack it, just move ahead. Higher studies are a very good option you got. We have N.I.C.M.A.R, which offers great courses and placements, but its really costly and Middle-class people will find it very difficult to pay. [LINKED_TEXT: M.B.A] [URL: http://m.b.as/] is no big deal nowadays, if you wanna do it anyway pursue M.B.A from a renowned institute or else just leave it. If you wanna enter a teaching field, then pursue M.Tech from a better college. G.A.T.E is required for admissions in good colleges, again it's really competitive if you can work hard go for it. These are the ways how Civil Engineers can survive with a better future, its patience, confidence, planning and being sensible that will help you out. Don't get frustrated at your early days, your hard work will pay you. Avoid the negative sayings of the people, don't get jealous of watching others having fun too early, we all know it takes time to build a strong and elegant Building. All the Best, Cheers!

If you aren‚Äôt rich enough to fund it yourself, you‚Äôll need one or more outside investors. Same thing is true if you want to start a restaurant, where you need up-front money to buy equipment, do advertising, and so on. However, if your business can generate enough money from day one to support its expenses, you won‚Äôt need outside investment. Examples might be if you are a plumber, or dog walker, or life-coach, or software engineer (who wants to hire herself out to various clients for piece work)."},{"instruction":"By what right did Sweden enter NATO without Russia's consent?","output":"By the same right that Russia began the Warsaw pact without first getting the permission of Vanuatu."},{"instruction":"Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi?

Most restaurants and pubs here are tied to one particular supplier for both alcoholic and soft drinks, so if they are a Pepsi site, they are not allowed to stock Coke products and vice versa. And yes, I can easily tell the difference. Either comes as a nasty shock If I am expecting the other.

Keep your car clean Renting a car can be a great way for you to save money on your car, whether you are buying a new car or trying to maintain it. 2. Get More Comfortable You might not be able to drive something soft and cushy on road trips. Perhaps you are planning a holiday road trip and want to visit family members in Missouri. But your pick-up's seats leave you feeling sore on the highway. 3. True Test Drive Are you thinking of buying a new car? Instead of just driving around the block talking to a dealer about the awesome features of your new car, go on a weekend trip. Know what you're getting into. Renting a car is a great way to test before you buy. Some rental companies even have the ability to sell cars. 4. Only to Show Off There are many reasons you might want to improve your appearance.

For instance, is the visible graph the entire function, or is it simply a subset of its graph and you are meant to visually extrapolate from the given behavior? Maybe the function looks like a polynomial on the given domain, but then quickly changes to an exponential outside. Maybe there are discontinuities in the given donation that are not visible without zooming in. It‚Äôs always safer to be very careful and make sure you know what the function is supposed to be doing before you decide anything about its properties based on its graph alone. That being said, if it‚Äôs clear from context that pathologies like what I described above are not being considered there are some simple rules. In plain English, a real function f is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting your pen. Id est, if the set of points {(x,f(x))} is a path-connected set. (This is a little circular since you need continuity to define path-connection, but it illustrates the point well topologically.) Ergo, a function is not continuous if its graph contains holes,its graph jumps by a finite amount at any point,its graph rushes to positive or negative infinity/is unbounded near a point in the domain, orits graph oscillates more frequently near a point of its domain. (Note when I say ‚Äúpoint of its domain‚Äù I mean to exclude the possibility that f has the above pathologies as x tends to infinity since such functions can still satisfy the definition of continuity.)"},{"instruction":"What percentage of commercial airline pilots could have had the same successful landing as the crew of the Boeing 777 United Airlines flight 328?","output":"It would be out of the ordinary for any fully trained, current, professional airline pilot crew to not land an aircraft safely after it had experienced an engine failure."},{"instruction":"Why is Don Lemon not released from CNN while Megyn Kelly was released from NBC for saying much less?","output":"Preposterous!

Which is what the majority of people want. I used to think HK away a super place until I caught the whiff of tear gas when criminals were destroying public and private property and inconveniencing the majority for their ill conceived ideas of ‚Äò‚Äùdemocracy‚Äù. If, however, you are a social activist or a member of the National Rifle Association of the US - the NRA - then look elsewhere to live. Singapore has: no freedom of speech no freedom of assembly no free press no real democracy draconian punishments for misdemeanor crimes, death for others. The People‚Äôs Action Party has had a stranglehold on power since the mid 1960s. Singaporeans are looked after from cradle to grave and in return they are expected to follow the dictates of the PAP. The PAP uses the Internal Security Act , which they inherited from the British , to suppress dissent. if you speak out against the PAP you can be locked up for 10 years. When is the last time you heard of protests or protest marches in Singapore? You haven‚Äôt because they are banned. Singapore has the distinction of holding the longest political prisoner in modern history. If you google Chia Thye Poh you will see that he spent more time incarcerated than Nelson Mandela, including solitary confinememt. He spent 33 years in prison, solitary and house arrest WITHOUT CHARGE or TRIAL to Mandela‚Äôs 27 . Not that this is unusual in SE Asia. You will recall that 2,000 teenagers were thrown into prison in 1967 anti- colonial riots without charge or trial in Hong Kong. Their crime: holding up placards and handing out phamplets that said BRITS OUT OF HONG KONG. Hong Kong burned for months during that period of unrest. All foreign publications entering Singapore are censored. Any publication that is critical of Singapore is not distributed. ( same as the democracy of Indonesia). In the past, critics of the regime were branded communists and thrown in prison. Now the government sues for libel and strips you of all your assets.You have to be a brave person to enter politics as an opposition candidate. All of your public words are scrutinized to effect a libel case. Little wonder that for several decades, out of 400 elected officials, there were only 2 members of the opposition. Singapore doesn‚Äôt have a genuine parliamentary democracy. Like numerous other nations who claim to be a democracy Singapore is in practice a one party state. The Far Eastern Economic Review of HK reported that the government sends out loudspeaker trucks in districts where the government thinks an opposition emended may win . The message blared out from the loadspeakers is that voting for the opposition means a reduction in government services and money for that district. A journalist friend of mine in HK a wrote an article for the International Herald Tribune which documented how the courts in Singapore are in the pockets of the PAP. That issue of the IHT was not distributed, the IHT was charged and fined. My friend was charged and fined in absentia. The IHT paid his fine. He is now persona non grata in Singapore. The English language newspaper of Singapore reads like a sanitised version of Pravda. Punishments for crimes are very draconian and inhumane. Caning is still used as a deterrent. The miscreant is strapped to a trestle with buttocks bared. Then a long piece of of bamboo is expertly wielded on the same place on the buttocks. The skin breaks after the third strike resulting in scarring. You will recall the case of the American teenager that got caught spray painting cars in Singapore some years ago. He and his family fled Singapore to avoid this kind of brutal punishment. I see that in August of this year, the government of Singapore has announced that they are doubling the number of police CCTV cameras. Currently there are 90,000 cameras which will be increased to more than 200,000 by the year 2030. As of November 2020, London had 691,000 CCTV cameras, but difference with Singapore is that the vast majority are privately owned not by the police in London. Jake Van der Camp, a journalist for the SCMP in HK , has made in the past a convincing argument that Singapore is the closest system in the world to the utopia envisioned by Karl Marx. After he retired , the former first minister of Singapore - Lee Kuan Yue - was appointed as an official advisor to communist China. Why ? Because the reds saw how he forged Singapore from a mosquito ridden swamp into the world class place that it is today though total control of the populace . They admire the Singaporean style of government. And that is the vision that they have for China, and Hong Kong. HK is becoming like Singapore more every day especially with the new national security law enacted in HK. After he retired in 1970, Lee Kuan Yew spoke at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Hong Kong. he was taken to task by the journos over the lack of civil liberties in Singapore. A brilliant politician, Lee deftly batted away any criticism of the regime he founded in Singapore. That was front page news in the SCMP next day. If you are from the US and a member of the NRA who moves to Singapore, just be aware that anyone caught with a gun in Singapore is executed. Don‚Äôt even think of bringing your weapons. Which is one very good reason there is no gun crime in Singapore. Only the police have guns, not criminals. Having said all that, I would have absolutely no problem moving to and living in Singapore as, like 99.9% of the population , I just a peaceful happy and safe life. It helps that I am not a social activist, nor am I a member of the NRA."},{"instruction":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","output":"Intraday trading means buying and selling in the same day. It may be either buying first or short selling. Normally intraday traders book profit in small margins. People are making profit by repeated trades or by trading large quantities. One thing to be mentioned here is intraday trading is high risk involved. The Golden rule of intraday trade is ride with the trend. Hence the first step to make profit in intraday trade is to identify the stock. Intraday charts are the best way to identify stocks for trading intraday. Also one should make a good home work before entering in intraday trade. Home work means, study the historical charts and find out the upward or downward moving stocks. Then see the previous days intraday chart. Find out the support and resistance levels. The better strategy will be buy at previous days support level and short at previous days resistance levels. Also shorting below support level and buying above resistance level are good ideas. Keeping stop loss is very important for intraday trade. Otherwise one will loose heavily. Where to keep stop loss is a very important question. Again previous days intraday charts will help. If one shorted in a stock, keep stop loss at previous days high or days high. Also if bought, keep stop loss at previous days lows, or days lows. Another thing to remember is keep trailing stop loss and revise stop loss when one is in profit. Instead of booking profit, one can keep stop loss for profit and can revise according to upward movement. Normally this will help a lot in intraday trade. The two things to avoid in stock market and particularly in intraday trade is panic and greedy. When one enters in a trade and goes in opposite direction, don‚Äôt be panic. Wait some time, keep strict stop loss. If stop loss triggers, don‚Äôt enter again. Wait some time and relax, watch the market trend and enter in some other stocks. Another thing to avoid is greediness. Some people will not book profit and wait for more and more profit. But such people will end up in loss only. In intraday trade book profit in every highs. Wait for a dip and enter again if trend sustains. The best time to enter for intraday trade is after 20 to 30 minutes when the market opens. Some people will jump in the market at the opening bell itself. It is risky always. Watch the market in the early trades and find out the trend. First enter in some small quantity, say 25% of the quantity one is intended to buy. Then buy more in the next 10 to 15 minutes. The trend observed is intraday trading is stocks will shoot up till after 45 to 1 hour when the market opens. This is the best time to book profit.

James Pan is correct that a PC/laptop OS built exclusively for touch as a replacement for the mouse is, ergonomically speaking, terrible. This has been known by UX designers for quite a long time. But, go use a Surface Pro. I use mine in laptop mode almost exclusively, but constantly use on-screen gestures and interactions as second-nature now. (If I‚Äôm just surfing or otherwise making little use of the keyboard, I often have one hand on the trackpad with the other sitting just behind the screen so I can use my thumb for scrolling, or click larger links/buttons/etc. In fact, when I start using a laptop that doesn‚Äôt have touch, I miss it, and it feels like an incomplete, unnatural experience. And, to all those saying that ‚ÄúI have the track pack‚Äù which is ‚Äúbetter design‚Äù because it‚Äôs ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù, that‚Äôs garbage. On-screen gestures are mapped 1:1, where as track-pad interactions have to be translated. It‚Äôs fine for most things (and maybe even preferable for some, like moving the mouse cursor), but, for some things, on-screen is simply better, or just as good. And it occurs to me that software and hardware that ‚Äújust works‚Äù would allow someone to touch a large icon on the screen and know that it‚Äôs intended as a mouse click. So, while we have that fairly ancient quote from Jobs about terrible ergonomics, only Apple can tell us why they don‚Äôt use touch these days, because that quote just isn‚Äôt accurate anymore (because, as noted above, PC/laptop touch is meant to complement mouse interactions, not replace them)."},{"instruction":"What are the best baby skin care products?","output":"1.

There are a variety of methods one can use to reduce face fat, including diet and exercise, facial exercises, and even some lifestyle changes. 1. Diet and Exercise: Eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise are essential components of reducing face fat. Eating a diet that is high in complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats will help to reduce overall body fat, including facial fat. Additionally, engaging in at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise five times per week will help to burn calories and melt away fat. 2. Facial Exercises: There are a variety of facial exercises that can be used to help reduce face fat. These exercises include things like puckering your lips and making exaggerated facial expressions, or simply massaging the facial muscles in a circular motion. Doing these facial exercises for five to ten minutes each day will help to tone and tighten the facial muscles, which can reduce the appearance of fat in the face. 3. Lifestyle Changes: Making a few small lifestyle changes can also help to reduce face fat. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary beverages and processed foods will help to reduce overall body fat, including fat in the face. Additionally, reducing stress and getting adequate rest will also help to reduce facial fat. 4. Skin Care: Taking care of your skin is also important when it comes to reducing face fat. Using a good facial cleanser and moisturizer will help to keep the skin healthy and hydrated, which can help to reduce the appearance of facial fat. Additionally, using a good sunscreen can help to protect the skin from sun damage, which can also help to reduce facial fat. By making a few changes to your diet and lifestyle, and incorporating some facial exercises and skin care, you can reduce face fat and achieve a more sculpted and toned facial appearance.

In 1988, Mike Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. He was undefeated and considered by many to be the greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2020, Tyson Fury is the reigning WBC and lineal heavyweight champion. He is also undefeated and is considered by many to be one of the best heavyweights of all time. So, who would win the fight between these two legendary Tysons? Both men are immensely talented and have proven themselves to be true champions. There's no question that Mike Tyson was one of the most ferocious and intimidating boxers in history. His fists were like sledgehammers, and he had the power to send any opponent crashing to the mat. He won 26 of his first 28 fights by TKO, 16 of which came in the first round. Tyson Fury is probably the better boxer of the two, but Mike Tyson was always considered to have the better knockout power. In a fight between these two, anything could happen. However, the size discrepancy between these two heavyweights simply cannot be ignored. Tyson was never the biggest boxer in the ring. With a height of 5‚Äô10‚Äù (178 cm), a weight of 100 kg (220 lbs), and a reach of 180 cm (71 inches) throughout his career, he was much smaller than his opponents. The average heavyweight boxer is 6‚Äô3‚Äù (190.5 cm), weighing 108 kgs (238 lbs), with a reach of 194 cm. Given Mike Tyson‚Äôs extraordinary combination of speed and power, however, this size differential rarely mattered. To close the gap between significantly taller opponents, Iron Mike perfected the Gazelle Punch or leaping hook/jab. (The boxer bends slightly to build explosiveness in his legs before quickly lifting up from a lowered position to throw the punch while moving through the air towards the target ‚Äî just like a gazelle leaps). But, Tyson Fury is a different kind of large. At 6'9\\", he is one of the tallest heavyweights in boxing history, and his 84\\" reach is longer than any other heavyweight in the division. This means that he can fight at a distance and still land his punches, while his opponents struggle to get close enough to land their own shots. Tyson Fury also has unbelievable hand speed for a heavyweight. He is able to throw punches in quick succession and catch his opponents off guard. In addition, The Gypsy King has shown great resilience in his career so far. In his fight against Wladimir Klitschko, he was knocked down twice in the first round. Fury showed his mental strength by not only getting up but going on to win the fight. He did this by adjusting his game plan during the fight, changing tactics, and fighting on the front foot, which ultimately led to him winning the contest. Personally, as much as I love Iron Mike, I think Tyson Fury would win. You can never count out a puncher of Mike Tyson‚Äôs caliber, but the 270-pound Gypsy King would likely push Iron Mike and his peek-a-boo style around the ring. Tyson Fury is the better boxer, and he's shown time and time again that he has the mental toughness to overcome any challenge."},{"instruction":"w much salary CMA's get per month?","output":"Range between 12- 18 Lakh per annum as experienced CMA if you join company as fresher avg salary would be 7.5 lakh per annum"},{"instruction":"Why does my cat sit on my feet when I'm standing?","output":"I LOVE IT !!!

Leasing a car means that you're essentially renting it for a set period of time, usually 2-3 years. At the end of the lease, you have the option to return the car or buy it outright. Here are some pros and cons of leasing a car to help you decide if it's the right choice for you. Pros: 1. Lower monthly payments One of the biggest advantages of leasing a car is that your monthly payments are typically lower than they would be if you were buying the car outright. This is because you're only paying for the depreciation of the car during the time that you're leasing it, not the entire cost of the car. 2. Lower upfront costs Leasing a car also typically requires lower upfront costs than buying a car outright. This is because you usually don't have to make a down payment, and the fees and taxes associated with leasing are usually lower than they would be if you were buying the car outright. 3. No long-term commitment Leasing a car is a great option if you're not sure whether you want to commit to a particular car or if you like the idea of being able to switch cars every few years. This gives you more flexibility than buying a car outright, which can be a long-term commitment. 4. Maintenance and repair costs are covered Most leases come with a maintenance and repair package, which means that you won't have to worry about paying for any repairs or maintenance that the car needs during the time that you're leasing it. Cons: 1. Mileage restrictions One of the biggest disadvantages of leasing a car is that there are usually mileage restrictions. If you go over the mileage limit, you'll have to pay extra fees. This can be a problem if you have a long commute or if you like to take road trips. 2. No equity When you lease a car, you're essentially renting it, which means that you won't build any equity in the car. This means that you won't have anything to show for the money that you've paid into the car at the end of the lease. 3. You don't own the car When you lease a car, you don't own it, which means that you won't have any control over how the car is maintained or how it's used. You'll also have to return the car at the end of the lease, which can be a hassle. 4. Extra fees Leasing a car typically involves a number of extra fees, such as acquisition fees, disposition fees, and security deposits. These fees can add up quickly and make leasing a car more expensive than you might expect. In conclusion, leasing a car can be a good idea for some people, but it's not right for everyone. If you're someone who likes to switch cars every few years or if you're looking for a lower monthly payment, then leasing a car might be a good option for you. However, if you're someone who likes to own your car or if you have a long commute or like to take road trips, then leasing a car might not be the best choice for you.

However, nothing on hand could fit between the plastic bits. I figured it must have been a fancy pencil sharpener, but quickly discarded the idea, seeing its stupidity. We then figured that maybe it was just a thing, a piece of promotional material, that served no function whatsoever.

But when you have crazy friends(Aadarsh, you are included) you learn to do pointless, aimless things. Last night I watched my first Sushant Singh movie(not his fan/hater) . Thanks to my friend(s) for suggesting it. Here's my review with a pinch of blatant honesty and lens of life philosophy: 1)The first thing which I don not like about the movie is the last ten minutes of the movie. Climax scenes could have been more engaging if those scenes were not shown in bits n pieces. Another reason is_ love, romance,life death that‚Äôs the whole essence of this adaptation. Love transforms a person, and loss of a loved one shakes, shatters, changes you into a different being. As a viewer, I wanted more action and words from Kizzie than watching the montage of his memories. I wanted her to pull that boy's cigarette away, because it was his thing. I wanted a scene where she visits his grave even after months. I missed Hazel Grace‚Äôs reaction to several Facebook comments, and those family and friends who claimed how well they know him. 2)The theatre scene, it was pathetically shot. The actors pulled their role decently. Why such shody film making? A person is writhing in pain, in a packed movie theatre and nobody noticed, I guess Rajnikanth mania is for real. A meaningful scene,but badly shot. What a loss!! It is my favourite scene because it projects a cunning philosophy of life. In life we all want to become independent, just with the hope that someday, somebody will find us dependable and lean on us. Manny's took the step to heal himself, to become a self-dependant man by dragging himself to his favorite spot, but life ain't so easy. Our aim to own independence makes us interdependent in eachother. 3)The cigarette metaphor, why John Green? In my opinion, if you will keep a gun close to you, someday that will take your life. To play with death is not fun. Some people do take metaphors literally. 4)The lack of depth in Kizzie's mother. Mother of a cancer patient is no ordinary woman, but the movie portryed her like a typical Bollywood version of Indian mother who is always worried about her daughter's relationship, their culture, food and blahh. Why did they not show all the preparation done by her mother, their families and the team of doctors for the trip. A flight or an airport scene could have brought continuity and connectivity with the movie. In the book, Hazel's mother has so much depth she studies healthy recipes for her, enrolled in a course to counsel cancer patients. I guess they distorted this character too badly to contextulaize it for Indian viewers. 5)Lastly, I liked that idiosyncratic man(Saif). Why was his scene so short? He could have become the backbone of the movie way better than the raja_rani narration. 6) ‚ÄúThe song‚Äù was lost in bunch of unnecessary background music. I don't like music of this film. Music should be in harmony with the script, and scenes. If they had taken all the effort to replace the book with the song, why was Kizzie not given a chance to speak about reasons for loving it. That would have made her more sensible than a stupid girl who let's a man in her room. Anything deep is abstract and ambiguous, since the movie makers wanted the story to be more preachy that they made it shallow with shoddy work. I thanks this movie for making me fall in love with the book I did not like at first read. Now, I will read it again. After watching the movie, I have realised Paris is better than what they projected, so badly want to visit Amsterdam and Paris. P.S on a lighter note, I so love Kizzie's dressing style. I want to have her dress collection."},{"instruction":"w can I get a call history of any number?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"Will the government shutdown be permanent?","output":"I hope so."},{"instruction":"f you quit Quora, do you think anyone would miss you?","output":"I started answering questions in Quora in 2017, after my boyfriend of more than two years passed away.

Should I sit in on his class for a day?","output":"I read some other comments, and, yes, sometimes it is the teacher‚Äôs behaviors, and you will need to pull your son out of that situation. Think of this as the last resort though. You have options. I have a fantastic nephew who is now a firefighter/paramedic. He had a similar situation as your son. Two teachers decided things about him early on. He couldn‚Äôt move or breathe without upsetting these gals. My sister repeatedly met with these teachers. Then she went to see the principal who sided with the teachers. The last straw though came the day one teacher hurt my nephew during class. Dug her fingers into his skin, leaving marks. My sister took pictures and showed the superintendent. Those pictures were going to police if they didn‚Äôt move my nephew to another class. Permission granted ‚Äî he had the best year after that. But don‚Äôt go to ‚Äúcrisis mode‚Äù just yet. Right now, you need some conflict resolution advice. The reality is today‚Äôs school environment is tomorrow‚Äôs workplace. Stay positive and move from a neutral position. I mean, yes, this teacher might be the worst, but sometimes that‚Äôs not the reality. Your son will have to deal with all sorts of crazy behavior from bosses and coworkers in the future. I had a teacher who liked to call those ‚Äúteachable moments.‚Äù But these are definitely life skills you want your son to gain out of this experience. That said, it‚Äôs true we have some teachers who love their jobs as educators, and others who are punching the clock. Sometimes kids are acting out in class because of the teacher‚Äôs style of teaching. Maybe it‚Äôs because they wanted a different teacher. Sometimes something else may happen in that classroom beyond the subject and/or the teacher. You want to work as a team with your son and the teacher to resolve any issues impeding his education. He needs to successfully make it through and pass the class. I would first arrange a meeting to discuss these disciplinary slips. Ask your son about his perspective so you can go in with his side. Then, ask for the teacher‚Äôs perspective while staying neutral. Tell the teacher that you will need to observe your son‚Äôs behavior. Really, how can you help the teacher unless you know what‚Äôs happening, right? (Some have suggested popping in without notice. The problem though is not all schools allow for impromptu visits because of security risks. Call the office and see what the protocol is for coming in to sit in on classes.)

There's almost no pros of doing that kind of dieting and it is almost sure to ruin your health in every way you can think of. This is the reason why many knowledgeable and experienced fitness professionals always advocate for losing weight as slow as possible. The simple reason for it is that losing weight makes your metabolism adapt to the lower calorie environment. The larger the caloric deficit , more is the adaptation. So by the time even if you reach your goal weight , you'd have a higher chance of gaining those lost weight back because your metabolism is still not accustomed to handling the sudden influx of higher calories that it used to handle during the deficit period. A slow rate of weight loss , prevents or minimizes the rate of metabolic adaptation and when the time has come to switch back to your maintainence calories , you're metabolism would comparatively be in a better state to handle the higher influx of calories compared to the weight loss period. As a result , you'd either maintain weight or see some weight gain which would not be significant enough to go on a long term diet again. The slower you go , the better you're going to maintain your metabolism which in turn would do a good job of preventing or mitigating any weight gain during the post diet period."},{"instruction":"Can an F15 fighter jet sink a ship with a smart bomb?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"the NDA training the toughest?","output":"The National Defence Academy (NDA) training is known to be rigorous and demanding.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don‚Äôt want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"I'll answer your question and then give you an alternative. An ethical vet will probably not, no. They'll tell you to go to the pound. It's not a medical concern, it's about your family just not wanting to deal with the cat. A vet that only cares about money will. It's about ethics. Obviously something is wrong with her, and it would take someone who cares about her to resolve those issues via veterinary care. I'm assuming you're too young to have the money to do so. Here's your alternative. Your family doesn't care. You do. Surrender her to a no kill rescue. Not a shelter or pound. A no kill. They'll help her get better and rehome her. Your family doesn't need to care and you can sleep at night. If need be, drop her anonymously at said no kill rescue. Put her in a carrier, and vanish. I've worked in places where that happens, and sometimes I understand why people do it. Desperation. If that is what you need to do, do it. I'd also personally tell your family that if they do this, you will move out as soon as you turn 18 and cut off contact. That you will hate them. If my parents had done that to me, I'd be done. No one that heartless and irresponsible is worth it to me. I was taught that animals are our companions and friends, and also our responsibilities. Not different than children. If they do it anyways, you'll know they don't care about you either.

What may be easy for them generally won't be for you Advice 2 : Do not follow multiple books, rather solve one book multiple times. Don't switch to other book when you haven't solved your coaching modules at least two times Advice 3 : While solving modules, mark questions which you weren't able to do in first attempt and revise then after you finish the syllabus a few months before JEE Advice 4 : Do not fall for a particular subject. Remember all the subjects have equal weightage in JEE. Rather try to make at least two subjects your strong point (Usually Chemistry and Physics) but don't make third the weaker one! (Pic : Aerial view of IIT Kanpur) Advice 5 : Do not fall for someone during JEE. It's going to ruin both you and your career Advice 6 : Give at least one mock each of JEE Main and JEE Advanced each week on weekend or whenever you are free. After attempting analyse your mistakes, make a separate notebook and write why you weren't able to solve it (conceptual/silly mistake). This I believe is the most important part of one's preparation! Advice 7 : Do not follow other‚Äôs strategies and time-table! You both are not the same. Try to make your own strategies like what to study when, which subject to attempt first in paper etc. Advice 8 : Try to sit three hours continuously on your study table without distractions as to imitate the real exam where you'll have to sit for the same duration. Advice 8 : DO NOT FUCKING WATCH MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS I've deliberately written that in bold words cuz I seriously mean that! Motivational videos gradually become an addiction and you long for it everytime you need to study. (Pic : IITK Hall-12&13) Alternative : Make short goals everyday like today I'll do 50 Q of indefinite integration and try your best to complete that. The satisfaction when you complete these short goals can't be achieved by some third person pushing you. Be you own motivator! Advice 9 : Do not value IIT as the sole goal of your life. Indeed IITs are the best the country has to provide but it isn't above your life. Advice 10 : Socialise when you can ,obviously not getting distracted though. If you have a cousin's wedding do attend it! Don't skip it over your ego cuz you're a serious aspirant :-P ! I realised this after coming to IIT ! Breaks like these are necessary sometimes Advice 10 : Try to sleep early and get early. Studying in the morning is always beneficial Advice 11 : Do not skip inorganic chemistry and make it your enemy. Mark my words, inorganic is the most scoring section in JEE and you can solve the questions within seconds, giving you marks and of course confidence to attempt other questions! Advice 12 : NCERT is the god for Inorganic and sometimes organic too for mains. Do it religiously. If You can‚Äôt understand some topic even after many tries ,and you don‚Äôt have enough time to prepare for that then ONLY leave that topic , not whole chapter Advice 13 : Do not hesitate to ask doubts from your teachers. You hesitate now, you're gonna loose a couple of ranks in the exam. Advice 14 : Take extreme care of your health. Remeber health is always the first priority and the pandemic has taught us this only! Go out in the mornings and evenings for walks, do meditation! Advice 15 : Refrain from social media and smart phones! Pretty obvious I guess! Advice 16 : Refrain to talk from people who have negative vibes, who always cry over something or the other! Try to be as positive as possible during the preparation phase. Advice 17 : For organic chemistry, solve only your coaching modules! They are more than sufficient. When I was an aspirant I bought 4 different books for organic and realized something was missing in one and present in other, pushing me in a dilemma as to where to study from. Later, my resonance modules proved to be best! Try to treat organic mechanisms as laws of physics! Advice 18 : When doing modules, try to do questions in a limited time frame! Like 10 Main level questions in 20 mins and similarly 3‚Äì4 minutes for each Advanced level question. Always be in the exam mode. Advice 19 : Try to be consistent, whatever the hours you study 8 or 12 doesn't really matters if you ain‚Äôt consistent. Consistency, hard & smart work and dedication are very important apart from studying dedicatedly. Always finish your Home Work given by teachers on time and attend the discussion enthusiastically! Advice 20 : Make short notes of each and every chapter. Take an A4 sheet and write all the formulae and the concepts only which you tend to forget at times. After you‚Äôve finished syllabus, you will have 40‚Äì50 such A4 sheets. Before any mock, just revise them rather than going through a lot of notebooks. Advice 21 : Two weeks prior to the final exam, revise the syllabus from your notebooks and give one mock everyday till the last three days before exams. Next day, revise the whole syllabus from the short notes you prepared! Do not study a day or two before the final JEE Mains or Advanced! Try to relax, watch a movie or play games but do not study (you can revise inorganic though) Advice 22 : After the class is over, revise what was taught and do the HW given regularly. This is more important than clearing backlog. Strengthen what you have in your hands now rather than worrying over what is lost. Next day get involved in discussion of questions. This way you‚Äôll grasp a topic really well! I'll add more of such advices. In the meanwhile, all the best for your preparations! You can always DM me freely :-) Edit : I compiled my first year at IITK, do have a watch"},{"instruction":"Which screenshots deserve 33 million views and 300k upvotes?","output":"üíÄüçΩÔ∏è"},{"instruction":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","output":"I once answered a question that was basically a guy asking: Guy 1 is X Guy 2 is Y Which guy would you pick?

First of all, in order to avoid these kinds of issues (especially where there‚Äôs a material difference between lunch and dinner offerings), many buffets will close at 2:00 or 3:00 before opening at 5:00, as that way, there are no in-between customers. Of those that don‚Äôt close, your arrival time is most likely to determine your price, so if you arrived at 4:30 (let‚Äôs assume dinner starts at 5:00) and stayed through 6:00, you‚Äôre likely to pay the ‚Äúlunch‚Äù rate, although some places do limit what you can consume if you specifically choose a lunch option."},{"instruction":"Which song that was a major hit for an artist or band also created a backlash for them?","output":"‚ÄúThe Ballad of John and Yoko‚Äù by the Beatles.

It has been significantly expanded in recent years. Does Dubai have a sewage problem? As Dubai's population has boomed and its skyline expanded on a tremendous scale at great speed, some basic city needs suffer apparent neglect. Dr. Mohammad Raouf, an environmental economist based in Dubai, confirmed the Times Online report. He says the sewage dumping does happen and that it is a problem of capacity. Local municipalities in the UAE are responsible for managing, disposing, and treatment of [LINKED_TEXT: wastewater] [URL: https://www.wateronics.ae/brackish-water-ro-plant.html]. To match with the steep rise in sewage generation as a direct effect of an increase in the UAE's population, the government is investing in upgrading and extending sewer systems to ensure a sustainable sewage disposal and treatment system. Some of these projects are mentioned below by Emirates. Dubai is planning to build a new 30 billion dirham (8.17 billion) deep-tunnel sewage system to be completed in 2025, the emirate said in a statement carried by state news agency WAM on Sunday. Dubai Municipality has completed feasibility studies for the project and begun work on its design, the statement said. Construction is expected to start in 2019.

[[LINKED_TEXT: All dogs in Shenzhen, China will get microchipped by 2020 ‚Äì TechCrunch] [URL: https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/all-dogs-in-shenzhen-china-will-get-microchipped-by-2020/]] This is because dogs aren‚Äôt human. The difference between humans and dogs is that humans are very eager to spend good money to wear and carry microchips around with them wherever they go. Microchips are tiny and easily fit into phones, watches, rings, cards, and pretty much everywhere. Each device can hold more than one microchip. Microchips are not only ‚Äúmonetary‚Äù; they can even track your location, read your vital signs and movements, and share your location and vital signs and movement with nearby devices. Many humans are more than happy to pay lots of money to carry these microchips around on them. So, why would the government spend its own money to implant chips into unsuspecting humans when humans are so eager to knowingly pay good money to do it to themselves? No, most microchips are not implanted directly into humans yet, but humans are so obsessive about their devices that they‚Äôll pay even more money to replace their microchips if their devices are lost or stolen. Moreover, it‚Äôs not just the Chinese people. Chinese microchips are implanted into devices that are sold all over the world, such as phones, watches, rings, cameras, TVs, toys, appliances, car keys, and card keys used by hotels and employers. Most humans already pay money to carry many Chinese microchips wherever they go. The Chinese government doesn‚Äôt need to implant microchips directly into any humans for most of the world‚Äôs population to have Chinese microchips on them and even tracking them."},{"instruction":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, ‚ÄúNope, not worth it‚Äù and just left?","output":"Law enforcement agencies and their personnel have been bestowed with increased powers and material resources year after year and decade after decade in the 20th and 21st century. This lust is never ending, since many of these measures and devices makes the cops job easier, accompanied with less and less accountability, to the point where ‚ÄúTo Protect and Serve‚Äù has become an empty slogan. Being a police officer is no longer a popular career choice even for little boys. This is because Technology and the shifting landscape of applicable laws, enforced policies and practices in policing is a reality many veterans can‚Äôt get used to, or think yesteryears modus operandi was the normal and it is an insult that they be subjected to legal and constitutional restraints that are part and parcel of the American democracy and justice system. One might ask how did we get here. There are enough parties to blame, first in line is the public who keep electing ‚ÄúLaw & Order‚Äù candidates (whatever their stripes) who have no reservations about turning ‚ÄúLaw Enforcement‚Äù in to an occupying force with ever expanding budgets and authority. Then there is the rank and file of police unions, with strict code of silence, and convenience of self investigative powers. And police unions have been no light weights in minimizing officer liability, maximizing compensation and bending service rules to tip scales of justice in their favor. Take your pick who you would like to blame. With good health, sizeable assets to weather minor financial hardships, an in demand expertise (Security, is a big industry) and probability of finding highly remunerative employment they figure they would be better off quitting the force. Can you blame them for looking out for themselves. I don‚Äôt. Another point is do we want officers who can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt like to do their job under legal and constitutional restraints. Every police video I have ever seen, they, on purpose or chance, appear acting like ‚ÄúGOD ALMIGHTY‚Äù with unquestionable, instant, compliance of their EDICTS however unreasonable or impossible to perform. (I can find greater details: But in summation a senior citizen was yanked by force from his car because he was Deaf and Mute and therefore couldn‚Äôt comply with the orders barked at him. This action dislocated the man‚Äôs joint resulting in incredible pain, requiring months of treatment and thousands in expense.) So the officers who are leaving, thank you for your service. They will be compensated according to the rules of service, and we wish them well in finding a career more lucrative, and to their greater liking. Author welcomes corrections or amendments. P.S.

So, understand that whatever your score might be on SAT/ACT, it might not be enough. But the expectation is that you have at least a 95% score on standardized tests (SAT, ACT).

It is based on the Greek alphabet, though, with a few symbols coming from the Demotic Egyptian script. The Coptic script first appeared in the Hellenistic age (323 BC onward). Now, the Greek alphabet comes from the Phoenician alphabet (actually abjad), which can be traced back to the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Greek alphabet first appeared around the 9th or 8th century BC, but didn‚Äôt take its final form until a few centuries later. Thus, the genealogy goes: Egyptian hieroglyphs ‚Üí Phoenician abjad ‚Üí Greek alphabet ‚Üí Coptic script. Each step of the way contained its own developments and changes from the earlier forms. The Greeks, for example, were the first to use symbols for vowels. In case you haven‚Äôt been persuaded, remember that the Coptic script is alphabetic, i.e. it depicts both consonants and vowels; the latter are identical to their Greek counterparts.

It's generally recommended to aim for gradual weight loss for the sake of your health and to increase the likelihood of maintaining your progress over time. However, if you have a specific short-term goal, here are some strategies to consider. Keep in mind that these approaches should be used with caution and only for short durations: Caloric Deficit:Create a significant caloric deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body needs. This can lead to rapid weight loss, but it may not be sustainable or healthy in the long run.Low-Carbohydrate or Ketogenic Diet:Restricting carbohydrates can lead to quick initial weight loss due to water loss and reduced glycogen stores. However, this may not be suitable for everyone and can lead to nutritional imbalances.Intermittent Fasting:Restrict your eating to a specific time window each day or follow a pattern of fasting and eating. This can lead to reduced calorie intake and may result in some quick weight loss.Meal Replacement Shakes or Very Low-Calorie Diets:Replacing meals with shakes or following a very low-calorie diet can lead to rapid weight loss. However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional before trying such approaches, as they can be nutritionally inadequate.Increased Physical Activity:Engage in high-intensity workouts, long-duration cardio, or multiple daily exercise sessions to burn more calories. However, excessive exercise without proper nutrition can lead to health risks.Extreme Short-Term Measures:Techniques such as sauna use, dehydration, or using laxatives can lead to rapid temporary weight loss, but they can be harmful and are not recommended for weight loss. It's crucial to emphasize that these approaches can have negative consequences, including muscle loss, nutritional deficiencies, metabolism disruption, and the potential for weight regain once you return to normal eating habits. They are not sustainable for long-term weight management or overall health. Before attempting any quick weight loss strategies, consider these factors: Health Risks: Rapid weight loss can lead to health problems, including electrolyte imbalances, gallstones, and heart issues.Short-Term vs. Long-Term: Quick fixes often result in short-term changes. Sustainable weight loss involves creating healthy habits that you can maintain over time.Individual Variation: Responses to rapid weight loss vary widely among individuals. If you're looking to lose weight, consider working with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to develop a safe and effective plan tailored to your needs and goals. A balanced approach that involves healthy eating, regular exercise, and gradual changes is more likely to result in lasting success."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection?","output":"A lucid dream is a dream were your mind is ‚Äú awake and aware ‚Äú that it is dreaming.

Evolution is descent with modification within a breeding family, speciation like what we see with frogs they stay frogs just different species of frog, natural selection which the organism can only select from the information within their genetic pool and mutations most mutations are either negative or neutral and for a beneficial mutation to change a body plan it would have to happen extremely early in the embryonic stage which is shown to be 100% fatal. So the deception is stretching evolution to its breaking point to stuff in Darwinism i.e. land animal to a whale. And laying a bunch of fossils that look similar in a line and imposing a Darwin of the gaps argument on the similarities is simply storytelling it's not science. The mechanism they claim that can with change a land animal into a whale has never been proven in a biology lab with the simplest of all organisms. In fact, we have a 33-year study of E. coli covering 78,000 generations of those stubborn things that want to stay E. coli. That's the way genetics works. So the idea that some ancestral cell magically cobbled itself up from chemicals, dirt are even ocean vents is anti-scientific. And then for that magical cell to diversify into the tree of life is equally anti-scientific. There is absolutely no evidence for that so what Darwinists do is take the work product of a designer and impose it on the similarities and then tell a story. So if we are going to save science from science fiction and fairytales we need to surgically remove Darwinism from evolution. You Darwinist have had a nice run but the jig is up. It's been close to 180 years and you've never shown with a simple organism that it can make the types of magical changes you assert. There is probably up to seven different definitions for species. But the type that is observable, testable, repeatable, and falsifiable is when a frog stays a frog and a dog stays a dog just a different species of both. Science is based on doubt, religion is based on faith. If you are a biologist and express doubts about Darwinism your career is over. And if you accept Darwinism you do that by faith alone because stealing the work product of a designer and claiming it's your process in action is disingenuous. It's like the old joke of God arguing with the Darwinist and the Darwinist said I can do anything you can do. So God reaches down and gets some dirt and forms an animal and breathes the breath of life into the animal and then tells a Darwinist, \\"It's your turn\\". So the Darwinist bends over and scoops up some dirt but God stops them and says, \\"Get your own dirt.\\" Darwinists need to establish their own argument for their fake science. They have to take a simple organism into a biology lab and come out with something that cannot be labeled by its original name. And then they need to demonstrate that over again to produce multiple different organisms and then they can establish that process produces the similarities they use to push their own story.

I‚Äôve been trading for over 2 years and based on this span I can certainly say that day trading is profitable by all means. You‚Äôll have to work your way up through your losses and trading isn‚Äôt easy, it requires tons of patience and discipline. I‚Äôve made some decent profits in the past few months and I think I owe it to certain rules that I follow. I‚Äôll try to explain the gist of them below - When you open a trade you should make sure that it ends in the following 4 ways. A Small ProfitA Big ProfitA Small LossBreak-even You should be absolutely sure to avoid big losses at any cost. As long as you avoid big losses you can be profitable in the long run. 2. You should have a good entry as well as exit strategy. Almost each and every trader concentrates all their attention towards improving their entries into the trade and no one seems to care about when to exit. I‚Äôve experienced that having a good exit strategy is more important than entry strategy and the best way to improve your exit strategy is to have a good Risk-Reward ratio. For implementing this use Target and Stop-loss for each and every trade. If you enter a trade without placing a stop-loss then trust me you are digging your own grave! Personally I use 1:2 as my Risk to Reward ratio and it seems to really suit my trading style. I use Opening Range Breakout (ORB) as my primary strategy. I firmly believe in Price Action Strategies than solely trading on indicators. 3. Use proper Money Management. It takes lots of losses to understand this crucial point. Unless and until you don‚Äôt implement a good money management you are going to lose money no matter how good your strategy is. Basically a good money management implies undertaking a certain amount of risk that you can afford to take. Use stop-loss and place it at a price you can afford to lose. If you really follow these 3 rules with proper discipline then I can vouch that you will perform well in the long run. I consider myself lucky that I‚Äôve learnt these things without facing much losses and at a very young age.

However, I believe in a modified version of this claim. Organisms without any gene transfer don‚Äôt evolve quickly relative to what how they would evolve with gene transfer because there is no way to bring synergistic genes together. Sexual reproduction is sometimes called vertical gene transfer. However, there are other types of gene transfer. Nonsexual ways to acquire genes are grouped together as lateral gene transfer. Replication without any gene transfer would lead to slow evolution due to a phenomenon called Muellers ratchet. Most unicellular organisms that can‚Äôt reproduce sexually have more than one type of lateral gene transfer. All bacteria, for example, have some type of lateral gene transfer. They can eat the gene discarded by a dead cell. Sometimes the eaten gene isn‚Äôt digested. It is incorporated into the genome of the bacteria. This is called transformation. Transformation doesn‚Äôt have to evolve. Bacteria often incorporate DNA by accident. However, some bacterial species speed up the frequency of these accidents when they are stressed. Most gram-negative bacteria can conjugate. They have pilli, special tubes where genes are exchanged. Genes can be transferred to or from a host by viruses. The viruses that parasitized bacteria are called bacteriophages. Some protists can absorb the DNA of bacteria, incorporating them in the cell. Dinoflagelletes have evolved to do this. Mueller‚Äôs ratchet can be beaten by means other than lateral gene transfer. Gene duplication can force correlation between synergistic genes. Lenski‚Äôs bacteria have been neutered so they can‚Äôt conjugate. So their lateral gene transfer has been slowed. However, they still have transformation. They seem to be evolving dispite Mueller‚Äôs ratchet. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong. Or maybe the importance of transformation will become apparent, eventually in these creatures."},{"instruction":"Who really runs the world?","output":"Whoever understands the mechanics of centralized power and have enough influence to control it.

One time a few years ago, I saw what looked like a wildfire starting right next to a highway in a city near my town, and apparently I wasn‚Äôt the first to call 911 about it, so the authorities were informed and got on it pretty quick. It‚Äôs harder to suppress them in rural towns because some start in farm fields and it takes a while for the one fire house to send out at least one or two trucks to help out. Sometimes these tiny rural towns have to call another town to get a fire truck to help! But the worst wildfires happen in remote places. The high mountain forests of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and the northern part of California are all sparsely inhabited. Often the wildfires start in places where there aren‚Äôt any humans to see what happened, and by the time someone does notice a problem, the wildfire has already grown to considerable size. It doesn‚Äôt help that mid- to late-summer is wildfire season, when California gets very hot and dry up in the mountains, making the trees and underbrush very dry and turning entire forests into tinder boxes, just waiting to ignite. Southern California is in as much danger of wildfires as the northern part, but for different reasons. Many of the fires that flare up in late summer are often caused by humans, such as some idiot tossing their cigarette butt out the window of their car into dry grass by the highway, faulty power lines, idiot campers who fall asleep while drunk and don‚Äôt mind their campfires, and finally‚Ä¶.arson."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"Being born and brought up in India, we‚Äôve all heard our parents talking about microwaved food is not so healthy.

Muay Thai, at least traditionally was much more kicking than punching or elbows. While they have always been part of the in close fighting of the style, until recently (the last 50 or so years basically post Dutch) the punches were not anywhere near as strong as western boxers. With the advent of the Dutch style of Muay Thai (guys like Ramon Dekkers) brought Muay Thai to the West but it also brought western Boxing to the East. That mixed with the recent surge in MMA has made Muay Thai much lore well rounded, Especially the past 25 years or so. Additionally the style of Muay Thai lends itself toward attack of the legs and torso much more often than the head. For these reasons I believe we see much less ‚ÄúEscaped Boxer Syndrome‚Äù or ‚ÄúPunch Drunkenness‚Äù in Muay Thai fighters than in Professional Boxing.

According to The Sleep Judge, 84% of adults have trouble sleeping at least once per week, with 32% claiming it happens every night! Here are seven insider secrets to better sleep that everyone should know before buying their next mattress. What kind of mattress should you buy? Figuring out what type of mattress is best for you depends on your sleep position. If you sleep on your back, a firm mattress that provides good back support is recommended. You should also consider the mattress‚Äô height. If it‚Äôs too low or too high for your frame, it can aggravate any injuries and prevent you from sleeping soundly. These considerations all contribute to a healthy night‚Äôs rest and give you one less thing to worry about come bedtime! Make sure you buy a mattress with maximum longevity in mind. High-quality mattresses typically last at least eight years, while those with the poor quality might only last two to three years. With these facts in mind, think about how often you want to replace your bedding. Do you want something new every few years? Or would investing in an expensive mattress that will last be better for your home? How much should I spend?: When deciding how much to spend on a new bedding set, start by doing some research into other people‚Äôs experiences with different brands and models.

The first time was in 2009 in Northern Virginia. It was a nice warm summer night, about 85 degrees. I was driving my younger brother‚Äôs 2002 Acura TL Type-S, dark grey with all black interior. The car was kinda a sleeper. It wasn‚Äôt Corvette level fast, but it could keep up with most of the six cylinder cars on the road, like 350Z‚Äôs, V6 Mustangs, etc. This Acura was also packed with several luxury features, one being sound deadening. It didn‚Äôt matter what was happening outside the car, inside was nice and quiet. This included driving at high speeds. The wind, the tires, the motor are all making a lot of noise but inside the car I couldn‚Äôt tell. I was driving back from Quantico to my home in Alexandria. I was running late, it was about 10pm, and I just wanted to get home and relax for a bit before work the next morning. There were not many cars on I95 northbound from Quantico. I slowed down at all the regular police hiding spots. I was in a rush, but I wasn‚Äôt trying to speed recklessly. I was definitely speeding though. The speed limit for half of this drive was 65mph, then the last half it slowed down to 55mph. I was cruising at around 70‚Äì75 mph. Or so I thought. Back then, from Quantico to Woodbridge, I95 was not well lit. After Woodbridge there were consistently more streetlights that would illuminate the highway and surrounding area. After I passed the Woodbridge exits I was more comfortable cruising at 75mph because the road ahead was well lit. There was not as much a risk of hitting an animal or not seeing a VA State Trooper hiding. I will admit, I was not paying attention to my speed. I remember that for a good 2‚Äì3 mile stretch where there were no other cars on the road. I had nothing to reference my speed off of so I just kept cruising. I was only focusing on the road ahead. At some point I noticed a car was approaching me from behind very quickly. This car did not have the headlights on. By the time I recognized the silhouette of the car as a police car, the VA State Trooper turned on the lights. I looked at the dash and I was going just over 100mph. I didn‚Äôt want to slam on my brakes so I downshifted then after a few seconds I gently started slowing down with the brakes. I pulled over next to the FT Belvoir exit. I turned on the interior lights, rolled down both front windows, took out my license and registration and proof of insurance (this isn‚Äôt required, I was just nervous lol) and put them on the dash. I then took out the keys and put them on the dash so they were visible. I put my hands on the top of the steering wheel. The State Trooper got out his car about a minute later and walked over to my door. He asked for my license and registration and I gave it to him. He asked if there were any weapons in the car and I told him yes, my handgun is concealed under my shirt and my rifle is secured in the trunk. He lifted my shirt to check that my handgun was where I said it was. He then asked me what kind of rifle I had in the trunk, what ammo it used, was it loaded, is it in a bag or hard case. He asked me to pop the trunk, which I did. He only looked in the trunk for a second and then closed the trunk. He then told me he will be right back. About five minutes later he came back and asked me if I knew why he pulled me over. I played dumb and said I had no idea. He asked me where I was coming from and where I was heading to. I told him I‚Äôm coming from Quantico and going home to Alexandria. He asked me why I was in such a hurry and I told him I was not in a hurry. He said that he clocked me doing 105 in a 55 mph zone and it took him several minutes to catch up to me. He then said ‚ÄòI‚Äôll be blunt. At the speed you were going I could arrest you right now for reckless driving and reckless endangerment. However, this is your first time being pulled over (it was my first time being pulled over EVER). the State Trooper handed me a ticket and explained that this ticket can‚Äôt be prepaid, that I have to appear in court. He then asked me to watch my speed and told me to drive home safe. Fast forward a few months and I‚Äôve had my lawyer ask for different court dates because I was traveling for work. My lawyer was good and would pick dates that were not this State Troopers regular court appearance dates. However, the judge was not happy about this and set a date in December and told my lawyer that I had to be there. Finally the day comes. My lawyer has prepped me ahead of time. She explained that Virginia is very tough on reckless driving and I will definitely be doing a few nights in county jail. This was a while ago so I might have the details mixed up, but I remember the judge said reckless driving, 30 days with 28 days suspended, which meant I had to spend two days in Fairfax County Jail. I was taken straight to the county jail since it is connected to the courthouse. My license was also suspended for six months, but I was able to get that changed to a restricted license (to and from work and other pre-approved activities). After six months of no incidents my license was reinstated. For the next couple years I took driver improvement course so my driving record points could go back to a positive number. My insurance was also slightly higher for the next two years. The second and third time I was pulled over going 100+mph was Spring of 2015, about two hours apart. I had been researching cars for several months and one caught my eye in January 2015. It was a model year 2000 Honda S2000 (AP1). It was silver with all red interior, which was a unique color combo for this car. It was listed at a dealer near Seattle for 21,999. The other unique thing about the car was that it only had 16,000 miles on it. I went back and forth with the dealer about the price for months and every few weeks we would start negotiations again. Everything checked out about the car. The mileage was legit, it was a one owner car, the interior was pristine, I had two different Pre-Purchase inspections done. Finally in May 2015 the dealer agreed to my original offer of 16,500 out the door everything included (tax, processing, etc). I contacted several vehicle shipping services but I was either quoted something ridiculous (7k was the highest quote) or I was given some excuse for them not being able to take the contract. I know it was a lot, literally coast to coast (Seattle, Washington to basically the Washington DC area). After two days of calling every shipping service I could find, I gave up in frustration and booked a one way flight to Seattle. I figured I would just drive it back myself. I flew out in the morning and landed around 8am. I arrive at the dealer before their regular hours (we agreed to this ahead of time) and I‚Äôm out the door within an hour with all the paperwork, title, and keys in hand (thank you 405 Motors in Washington). The dealer gave me a temporary three day tag. I later found out this was technically only valid in Washington State, but oh well lol. I had a nice little system going. I would drive for about 3‚Äì4 hours straight, stop to refuel and stretch, then keep driving. On the first night I rested, but on the second and third day I drove through the night and rested during rush hours. I was definitely speeding this whole trip. The car never ran out of breath and just kept going and going and I admittedly was enjoying the experience too much. I typically cruised on the highway at 80‚Äì90 mph. In Indiana I was pulled over twice, about two hours apart. Both times I was going over 100 mph. The police officers that pulled me over were very kind. I chatted with both of them about the car and my cross country trip back. Instead of giving me a serious ticket for driving over 100 mph, both officers gave me identical tickets for speeding. It‚Äôs been a while but I think they both put down that I was driving 79 mph. I didn‚Äôt have to appear in court and was able to pre pay both tickets. The whole drive was about 3.5 days and it was exhausting. I would not recommend it. Is it worth driving that fast? My answer is no, it‚Äôs not worth driving that fast on public roads. If you want to drive fast do it in a controlled environment like a track or drag strip. Between the tickets, lawyer, time lost it just not worth the hassle."},{"instruction":"What is Robert A.

Start by taking care of yourself by resting, avoiding activities that make the pain worse, and using heat or cold to reduce swelling and muscle strain. Do low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or yoga on a daily basis to build your core and back muscles and make you more flexible. Use stretches and movements that focus on the lower back, like the cat-cow, bird-dog, and bridge, to strengthen the spine and relieve pain. Keep a healthy weight and stand up straight when you do daily tasks to take pressure off your lower back. Talk to a doctor if you have pain that doesn't go away. He or she might suggest treatments like physical therapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, or acupuncture. In rare cases, pain control methods or surgery may be needed to help with the pain. For long-term relief from lower back pain, you should always focus on a method that is tailored to your specific needs.

It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare practitioner before starting any new treatment or medication for diabetes, including ayurvedic medicine. That being said, Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that uses a holistic approach to promote health and well-being. According to Ayurveda, diabetes is caused by an imbalance in the body's three doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha), and treatment typically involves a combination of diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies. Some commonly used ayurvedic herbs for diabetes include: Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known as gurmar in Hindi, which means \\"sugar destroyer.\\" It is believed to help regulate blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion and reducing sugar cravings.Bitter melon: Also known as karela, this vegetable is used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat diabetes. It contains compounds that are similar to insulin and can help lower blood sugar levels.Cinnamon: This spice is believed to improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate blood sugar levels.Fenugreek: This herb is known as methi in Hindi and is believed to help lower blood sugar levels by slowing down the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system. It is important to note that while Ayurvedic remedies may be helpful for some people with diabetes, they should not be used as a substitute for medical treatment.

Let‚Äôs start by defining social science. Usually this is an umbrella term for all scientific fields that deal with human systems. These include Economics, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Management, Marketing, Finance, Political Science, the list goes on‚Ä¶ There is a famous clip of [LINKED_TEXT: Richard Feynman] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman], the brilliant American physicist, where he describes social sciences as pseudoscience. It goes to show that even remarkably intelligent people can really get it wrong sometimes. Now I do conceed that his criticism is partially a valid one. Indeed, many, if not most, social science researchers until the mid 20th Century cared very little for empirical evidence. This was no longer true in the beginning of the 70s when this interview was recorded, but decades earlier, most social science was done either by writing long self-ethnographies about the author‚Äôs perception of how the world works, or incredibly dense mathematical deduction from basic axioms which were many times untested. This led to the rise of many theories that were simply wrong, or out of touch with reality. But still, some of these theories did later prove to be good representations of reality, by withstanding the burden of empirical proof. Since then the social sciences as a whole have become much more similar to the natural sciences. You construct a theory, and then you collect data to support your theory. And ultimately both your theory and your data should be quantitative in nature. All of the fields that I‚Äôve mentioned up there as being social sciences have formal mathematical expressions to describe many of its phenomena. Don‚Äôt believe me? Let‚Äôs see some examples: Anthropology - One of the most important areas of anthropology is the study of kinship systems. For many decades, mathematical group theory has been applied to this field to describe the formation of kinship terminologies across cultures. Here‚Äôs an example from a 2010 [LINKED_TEXT: research paper] [URL: http://mathematicalanthropology.org/pdf/BarbosadeAlmeida.0810.pdf] about the Dravidian kinship systems published on the Journal of Mathematical Anthropology and Culture Theory: It striked me as a good example of mathematical language going deep into the description of a cultural systems. And the most amazing part is that this kinship theory is not simply a mathematical artifact detached from reality, it is very efficient in predicting the kinship terminologies across cultures and languages. There‚Äôs a software called [LINKED_TEXT: Kinship Algebra Expert System (KAES)] [URL: http://csac.anthropology.ac.uk/Research/KAM] based on this theory which has a accuracy close to 100%. Sociology - For many decades sociology has been a very quantitative and empirical field. In particular social network analysis is one of its greatest achievements. Graph analysis as discrete mathematics tools already existed prior to its application in sociology. But sociology gave a strong contribution to find real world applications of it. Noawadays social network data is widely available and many of the theories developed in sociology are now being applied across a variety of fields, especially the node centrality measures which were initially developed for sociological problems (social influence and reference group theory). [LINKED_TEXT: Wikipedia has a very good article about it.] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis] (Source: By Screenshot taken by User:DarwinPeacock - Screenshot of free software GUESS, CC BY 3.0, [LINKED_TEXT: File:Sna large.png] [URL: https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6057981]) Psychology - Our brains are physical systems. And indeed, some of the earliest mathematical and quantiative theories in psychology came from the field of psychophysics, which studies how our nervous systems process incoming physical stimuli such as sound, light, temperature, etc‚Ä¶ And this led to the discovery of Weber‚ÄìFechner law. (Source: [LINKED_TEXT: Weber's Law of Just Noticeable Difference] [URL: http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/WebersLaw.html]) This is an empirically validated mathematical expression that attempts (very successfully) to describe the relationship between stimuli and perception. Economics - We all know that mathematical deduction forms an important part of economics theory. What you may not know is that Lie Group Theory has found applications along a wide variety of its areas including [LINKED_TEXT: growth economics] [URL: https://www.springer.com/us/book/9784431544296]. It appears that R&D processes and consumer taste changes can be effectively modelled by Lie Group Transformations (and this model has been empirically validated as well). Also in the field of behavioral economics, we have the famous example of Prospect Theory, which is a beautiful and elegant extension of classic utility theories to the realm of experimental lab science (also integrating insights from Weber-Fechner Law), showing that our decisions change according to the framing of our prospects (in terms of being gains or losses). More recently[LINKED_TEXT: Lie Group theory has also found applications in Prospect Theory] [URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2665.pdf]. It goes to show that social sciences can combine the mathematical sophistication of Physics with experimental and rigorous empirical testing of its models.Marketing - For many decades the [LINKED_TEXT: Bass Diffusion Model] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model] has been employed as a silver bullet in new product sales forescasting. It is a differential equation that is widely used in Marketing departments to predict sales of products. It appears that diffusion of innovations in markets always follows this pattern. Another widely used model is the [LINKED_TEXT: NBD-Dirichlet model] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerald_Goodhardt/publication/222575514_Understanding_brand_performance_measures_Using_Dirichlet_benchmarks_Journal_of_Business_Research_5712_1307-1325/links/5a2551ae4585155dd41ef75c/Understanding-brand-performance-measures-Using-Dirichlet-benchmarks-Journal-of-Business-Research-5712-1307-1325.pdf], which is a stochastic model of the [LINKED_TEXT: Double Jeopardy Law] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy_(marketing)]. Brands with higer market shares tend to to have higher customer loyalty as well, and this regularity is captured by the NBD-Dirichlet. These two models form the basis of the modern day Marketing Engineering.Finance - The most celebrated scientific achievement of the Financial science is the [LINKED_TEXT: Black-Scholes] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes] model, which is a partial differential equation that describes the price of an option over time. It was inspired by the study of stochastic processes in Physics, in particular Brownian motion. It is the cornerstone of Financial Engineering.Management - As an academic discipline management science is sometimes referred to as operations research, and it has an established history of getting things right since WW2. Most of its initial focus was supply chain, logistics and military action. Modern day management science also extends its modeling capabilities to human factors, which of course incorporates knowledge from organizational behavior, human resources management, psychology and sociology. Computational and statistical models that combine the study of human and non-human factors are [LINKED_TEXT: now beginning to enter common usage] [URL: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180103101113.htm]. Overall there seems to be a perception that social systems are not possible to describe using the same tools of the natural sciences and that social sciences are not ‚Äúreal‚Äù science. This is of course not true. In fact, with neuroscience and biology being increasingly used to explain behaviors and attitudes we could say that the distinction between these two worlds is fading fast. If we think about it every social system will utimately be a physical system. All of our perceptions, beliefs, emotions, memories and ideas occur in our heads (by which I mean our brains). Our brains are biological, chemical and electrical systems, which are ultimately physical systems made up of subatomic particles. Our behaviors and attitudes all originate from our brains as a reponse to our external environment (which as you may guess is also a physical system, or systems of systems). Therefore, by studying our social systems we are studying a part of the universe which also has patterns capable of being measured and described by mathematics. Qualitative and interpretive methods will still have a place though, especially when it comes to coming up with new research hypothesis. In fact quantitative approaches to this humanistic side of social science are also emerging with [LINKED_TEXT: Quantitative Semiotics] [URL: https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319615929] and [LINKED_TEXT: Quantitative Ethnography] [URL: http://www.quantitativeethnography.org/] as notable examples."},{"instruction":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","output":"Nothing since you already do that."},{"instruction":"it true, ‚ÄúBreaking: New York City teachers who refused the COVID jab had their fingerprints and personnel files sent to the FBI, per a recent report‚Äù or is this more China propaganda?","output":"Such BS ALL teachers have their prints sent to FBI.

So this century is the last one for all living things in the world. And I specify the reason for it. For most of the crises America is sole reason. America wants to be a sole police man of the world. For this reason America wants to destroy Russia. If Russia is destroyed then America will be only one super power in the world but it's only a daydream for America.

Intense bouts of resistance exercise damage the muscles, but consuming protein increases the number of amino acids in the body. These work to reduce deterioration, synthesize muscle proteins, and stimulate growth. Consuming 20‚Äì30 grams of protein before a workout can result in an increased rate of muscle protein synthesis that lasts for several hours. High-protein foods The following are some examples of healthful foods that are rich in protein: fish, such as salmon and tunapoultry, such as chicken and turkeynutsbeanslentilseggssoyCarbohydratesCarbohydrates are an essential energy source. Consuming the right amount of carbohydrates before a workout will ensure that the body has enough energy to perform well. This is true for people engaging in cardiovascular and resistance exercises, among other kinds. However, different types of carbohydrates will have a different impact: Simple carbohydrates: These are sugars that provide a rapid rise in energy. A common source of these carbohydrates is white bread. Complex carbohydrates: These include fiber or starch. They provide a slower, more long-term source of energy. Whole-grain foods are a good source of complex carbohydrates.

As per the Six Sigma methodology, you have to use the ‚ÄòM‚Äô, out of the full DMAIC steps i.e. Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. During the ‚ÄòMeasure‚Äô stage in Six Sigma, you actually take the output data of the process and draw it on a chart, and also calculate its mean, mode, median, and standard deviation. In Six Sigma, Standard Deviation is the key metric, that provides you the direct insight, into whether the process is performing within the desired standard requirements or expectations given by the customers or not. And it also helps you to calculate what is Six Sigma score or Z score of the given process (whether it is 2 sigma process, 3 sigma process, or 5 sigma process level). Accordingly, you can plan for its improvement based on the Six Sigma project using the full DMAIC methodology.

A [LINKED_TEXT: recent thread on Quora] [URL: http://www.quora.com/Business/Whats-the-shrewdest-smartest-maneuver-youve-ever-seen-in-business] asked users to name the \\"the shrewdest, smartest maneuver you've ever seen in business.\\" We've broken out some of the best answers, including critical decisions by Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Henry Ford. Reliance Jio launched in India in 2016 just before the famous Demonetization that gripped the country. (5 September 2016 to be precise) It gave never-before heard prices for Data ( 0.26 for 1GB of Data) whereas in the US the same thing costs a whopping 12.37 or 47 times more! Before its launch, data was damn expensive in India and cost at least 20 times more. Oh! and we forgot to mention one more thing, Calling became free all over India! You could call anyone to any mobile network or landline in India and it was free! So, you‚Äôd be wondering; how can this company make a profit? In India you need to pay interconnect charges (IUC) to the other network when you place a call to a number in that network. Suppose you call a Number on the ‚ÄòAirtel‚Äô network from your ‚ÄòJio‚Äô network, JIO has to pay interconnect charges or IUC to Airtel. Since, calling for free for JIO customers, they started calling left, right and center to various networks. This resulted in a huge IUC bill to JIO. So what did JIO do? It shortened the ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks from 45 seconds to 20 seconds. What difference did this make? When a customer would call another network, the call would ring for 20 seconds or 4‚Äì5 rings only. Since, 4‚Äì5 rings is a short duration to pick any call, the call would now become a missed call and that Airtel customer would now call the JIO customer back. Thus, JIO has reversed the situation and now Airtel had to pay IUC charges to JIO instead it being the other way round! JIO just made the best out of the worst situation by taking advantage of a loophole in the law. To put things into perspective, in one quarter ending June 2019, it saved around 33 million (or ‚Çπ254 crore) in IUC Charges. This continued for 2.5 years until other networks realized what was going on.

I know with out any doubt that I am right. If he would only have taken this information too the supreme court he would still be president and rightfully so. The reason he lost is the American voters were intentionally subverted by seditious slander by the main stream media. From day one the president told us the news was fake and that they never reported the good things he accomplished. Instead day in and day out the media collaborated with one another along with the democrat party , hollywood , and the FBI by making upfalse accusations , fake news , misinformation ,propaganda , and straight up lies. And just as bad they abused the 1st amendment by not informing the voters of important information that they had the right too know. I strongly recommend you look up subversion on Wikipedia and read how subversion works. Subversion is a type of mind control like brain washing. Mind control is considered an act of violence.and in America you can not overthrow the united states by an act of violence or force. The voters were with out their knowlodge or consent believed they were being told the truth and believed the lies. And still do.

It seems that the only corporations being affected are U.S. corporations (in other words, factories that actually belong to the U.S.). So this trade war is really doing more harm to the U.S. Trump is basically targeting U.S. infrastructure in China since he seems to think these manufacturing jobs should go back to the U.S. However, the actual U.S. corporations know and understand it would be suicide. American factory workers are more expensive than Chinese workers and China is way ahead in automation as well. It‚Äôs just cheaper to manufacture in China. Plus, the Chinese population, who constitutes almost 20% of the world population, is a major consumer of these goods, which helps U.S. corporations who don‚Äôt need to import since they are literally located in China. If they leave, they lose‚Ä¶ a lot. Nevertheless, production at these U.S. factories have gone down as a result. I suppose it would also affect their profit margins. So it‚Äôs hurting U.S. factories in China, and the body corporate back in the U.S. must be fuming at the mouth at Trump. I‚Äôve heard from my customers that some of these corporations are looking at places like Vietnam, Cambodia, etc. to keep the cost of manufacturing low enough to still be able to compete. So the jobs are not going back to the U.S. Furthermore, most of the manufacturing plants in those other countries are also controlled by China. So the money is still going to China. Another solution some U.S. manufacturers are apparently looking at is to use these other countries and places like Hong Kong or Taiwan as channels to keep exporting the exact same goods out of China, kind of like a back alley detour. Since the tariffs don‚Äôt apply to Hong Kong, Taiwan or neighbouring countries, these places can be used as ports from where they can export, negating the entire purpose of Trump‚Äôs tariffs. So in other words, the trade deficit can be artificially split by China to look like it went down while it really never did. It might work. Trump just wants to look good. So I have to be honest. This whole trade war has almost no impact on the Chinese side. Chinese and European manufacturers in China are largely unaffected. Even Google‚Äôs decision to ban Huawei form using some of their Android OS functions are having no impact here. Not a single phone in China uses Google Services or Play Store anyway since China already banned Google in 2012. Huawei phones in China mostly use EMUI, which is based on Android. They also have their own app store, and since I‚Äôm English and can‚Äôt use it, I basically download apps from Google Play, install it on my Huawei phone, and it works just fine.

Any detector is an observer. Any subatomic wave, interacting with another, is an observation. You might be thinking about the Wheeler‚Äôs Friend puzzle about Srodenger‚Äôs cat. Is the cat question merely entangled with Wheeler‚Äôs Friend, who has opened the box? Wheeler was looking for ways to rule out all but human consciousness as the observer. But he failed. [LINKED_TEXT: Wigner's FriendWigner's Friend Eugene Wigner made quantum physics even more subjective than had John von Neumann or even Erwin Schr√∂dinger with his famous Cat Paradox . Wigner claimed that a quantum measurement requires a conscious observer, without which nothing ever happens in the universe. In 1961 he complicated the problem of the von Neumann or Heisenberg \\"Schnitt\\" (or the \\"shifty split\\" of John Bell ) that forms the dividing line between the quantum world and the classical measurement apparatus. Wigner moved it farther into the conscious mind of the observer. Wigner is often said to have extended the problem of Schr√∂dinger's Cat , by adding a second observer inside the laboratory who is commonly known as Wigner's Friend . Popular treatments of Wigner's Friend usually describe it in terms of a live and dead cat. Actually, Wigner's example was a photon and whether its wave function collapsed to cause a flash on a screen or not. Wigner's goal was to show that only consciousness can collapse a wave function. The cat example is more vivid. You can see it on Wigner's page . Here we give Wigner's original photon example The physicist friend inside the lab either sees a photon flash or not. (In a footnote Wigner notes that the human eye can perceive as few as three quanta.) But Wigner is outside the lab and does not know the outcome. Wigner says that without human consciousness, this leaves the world in a superposition of states .\\" Wigner says that any inanimate material measuring device will leave both himself and his friend in a superposition of states. The only thing he sees that could change this is human consciousness , He resolves the paradox by saying that his friend's consciousness collapses the wave function inside the laboratory. Here is Wigner's complete argument: Given any object, all the possible knowledge concerning that object can be given as its wave function. This is a mathematical concept the exact nature of which need not concern us here‚Äîit is composed of a (countable) infinity of numbers. If one knows these numbers, one can foresee the behavior of the object as far as it can be foreseen. More precisely, the wave function permits one to foretell with what probabilities the object will make one or another impression on us if we let it interact with us either directly, or indirectly. The object may be a radiation field, and its wave function will tell us with what probability we shall see a flash if we put our eyes at certain points, with what probability it will leave a dark spot on a photographic plate if this is placed at certain positions. In many cases the probability for one definite sensation will be so high that it amounts to a certainty‚Äîthis is always so if classical mechanics provides a close enough approximation to the quantum laws. The information given by the wave function is communicable. If someone else somehow determines the wave function of a system, he can tell me about it and, according to the theory, the probabhttps://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/experiments/wigners_friend/] [URL: https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/experiments/wigners_friend/]But, Uncertainty shows itself, in condensed matter physics, also.

While certain weight control plans might yield momentary outcomes, they frequently miss the mark on supplements and can be trying to continue over the long haul. The Ketogenic Diet The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat eating routine that places your body in a condition of ketosis. While this diet might prompt speedy beginning weight reduction because of the body consuming fat for fuel, moving toward it with caution is fundamental.

As a ruler, she did look out for her people. She saw how their past of being warriors and trying to take over the galaxy periodically had caused them harm. Her own experiences during the Civil War definitely influenced this and her decisions. But her solution to this was avid pacifism, which while an admirable belief, does hold quite a lot of problems. For one, she took a people (and the Mandalorians were a very proud people) and completely erased a lot of their culture, as a lot of Mandalorian culture revolves around war. Her beliefs were initially very good at getting the Mandalorian to stop fighting, as she was able to remove the faction that was causing such problems (Death Watch). However, in the long term her decision was terrible for the people. Death Watch were not going to just roll over and let her win, and they would be able to gain ground against her by arguing about her erasure of culture, however violent it was. And with her new pacifist regime, there would be no army or military to protect them. Mandalore was undefended and Satine did not see the danger Death Watch may still pose, even in exile. Either she was will fully blind so as to keep the peace she had created, or completely ignorant: the first of which is not a good quality in a leader, and the second of does raise some eyebrows - after all, Death Watch and the other warriors were on a moon orbiting Mandalore, and someone should have noticed them building an army. But, she is shown to have compassion and care deeply for the people she rules. So, her heart is in the right place, but her ideals certainly put the entirety of Mandalore back into war (a war which, as it seems to be continuing after the Clone Wars and into Rebels, lasted nearly two decades). I would say that, despite the fact she put Mandalore into an era of peace for a good few decades, either her ignorance or denial put it back into the war she wished to avoid. So, during her reign, she was certainly a good ruler, but I don‚Äôt believe that the history books would look so kindly upon her.

Comparing ourselves to others can lead to feelings of inadequacy and jealousy, which can hold us back from achieving our own goals.Don't be afraid to take risks: While it's important to be cautious and thoughtful in our decision-making, it's also important not to be held back by fear. Taking calculated risks can lead to new opportunities and experiences that we may not have otherwise had.Don't hold grudges: Holding onto grudges can be toxic and prevent us from moving forward in our relationships and our lives. It's important to learn to forgive others and let go of negative emotions in order to focus on the present and the future.Don't neglect your physical and mental health: Our physical and mental health is essential to our overall well-being, so it's important to prioritize self-care and make time for exercise, healthy eating, and stress-reducing activities.Don't give up on your dreams: Life can be full of obstacles and setbacks, but it's important to keep pushing towards our dreams and not give up on them. Persistence and hard work can pay off in the end, and we may find that we achieve more than we ever thought possible.

Instead, I'll mention five interesting qualities of Indians (which I always took for granted) which I (re)discovered through conversations with non-Indians. 1. Survivors. Indians are survivors. They have survived invasions, famines, oppression, violence - you name it, and they still manage to scrape through and come out quite decently in the end. These are the 'all's well that ends well' people, those who sincerely believe that everything happens for 'good', that adversity is simply God's way of testing us and hence we should still be kind and compassionate no matter what befalls us. I have had foreigners point this out to me as a fact that struck them as naive and marvellous at the same time. It builds rock-solid resilience, allowing Indians to stand the test of time, they told me, while it also retains a childlike innocence in viewing the world and life. Extraordinary. 2. Tolerance. The religion bit is not that new any more, but the Indian tolerance towards all that is unpleasant is quite a characteristic. From nosy aunts, to ill-built roads, to loud babies in theatres, to irregular milkmen and maid-servants, to corrupt bureaucrats, to blatant racism, to openly ridiculing physical deformities, to shamelessly peeping into others' personal lives - we have it and accept it all. It was on Quora that I actually learnt that a lot of things that we take in our stride (and I am regularly 'guilty' of) are utterly horrifying to a lot of Westerners, however, I have had quite a few Western friends tell me that the ease at which Indians accommodate even the most insane things amazes them. 3. Colours. Indians are bright, bold and dazzling. While women flaunt every colour recognised by the human eye, the men are not left behind as well. We splash colours through Our clothes Our food yes, that's blue. Our art Our movies Our Gods Our houses Our festivals and the list goes on. Many non-Indians I met found that overwhelming at first, but it did not take them much time to adjust, and then grow fond of our zest for colours. An active interest in the beauty of the world, combined with a zeal to live life to the fullest, they said. 4. Hospitality. If there is one thing Indians take seriously, that is \\"Atithi devo bhav\\". Across religions and regions, one thing that really binds Indians is their treatment of guests. For a non-Indian, it can get awkward and over-bearing, but for Indians, guests and their comfort are of prime importance. Many non-Indian friends of mine who have stayed with us or other Indian families have appreciated, time and again, the warm hospitality they receive. Even after they have returned home, every time the topic of their trip comes up, they never fail to mention the hospitality as one of their fondest memories. Indian hosts, they say, are great at breaking ice, establishing closeness and informality, and making the guest feel like a family member, while spoiling him to the fullest with attention, curiosity, companionship, warmth and enthusiasm. Indeed, many of them want to visit again. 5. Curiosity. Many non-Indians are struck by the fact that Indians are genuinely curious about other cultures, customs, histories and countries. Indians who travel abroad or come in contact with non-Indians come across as a curious lot, keen to explore or at least be informed about other parts of the world, while the lesser privileged back home make the point clear by bestowing unabashed stares on anyone or anything looking 'unIndian', whether in reel or real life. Be it plain curiosity or a hidden agenda, Indians never cease wondering about how things are across the planet. Many non-Indians I know, especially Americans, marvel at the curiosity and the enthusiasm through which Indians look at the world."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me. I slowed, but he just drove away. What just happened?","output":"Ah! This reminds me of an older version of just the same sort of signal. Back in the late 60s when I learned to drive the common signal to warn a driver that a speed trap was up ahead of them, after you passed the speed trap, was to flash one‚Äôs lights at the oncoming car on the other side of the road. Well, I was a ne‚Äôer do well sort of guy in my town. Well-known as one of the outlaws, not a violent guy but someone the cops did not like. My brother had borrowed my car (Datsun 240z - souped up and able to go fast and never slow around corners) several times and outrun the cops as part of his fun with it. I never did that. So, they were out to get me, as they knew what the car looked like, but didn‚Äôt have the plate yet. I was unaware of this. They literally set up a speed trap on my folks back road to catch me‚Ä¶ and luckily never did. One day, I was flying down a back road and came around a corner and saw a police car going the opposite direction on the other side of the street. It was too late to slow down so I just kept the speed I was at. What did they do? Flashed their headlights at me, and the driver stuck his hand out his window making a slow down signal. I wondered, ‚ÄúWhat the heck!?‚Äù and slowed down, expecting them to spin about and chase me. Nope they didn‚Äôt. Instead, around the next corner was a speed trap. I had slowed just in time. The cops in the speed trap glared at me, hoping they could have got me for speeding. Years later, I met the cops that warned me and they laughed about what they did. They warned me not so much to help me as to mess with the guys in the speed trap. Oh, and these cops were friends of my brother and knew it was him running from cops, not me. So, if you get a signal like a flashed headlight or light bar, slow down, you‚Äôve been given a fair warning."},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"To begin earning money through affiliate marketing online, choose a niche you're passionate about, research high-quality affiliate programs, create a content-rich website or blog, promote products authentically, and engage with your audience.

I he was one of the bravest and most daring. Like Patton or Bull Halsey, he was larger than life. As a Captain and above he commanded in 11 Major engagements against Napoleon. At the Battle of Cape St Vincent, as a Commodore, his actions saved the day and the fleet flagship. His commander, Admiral Jervice, brought Nelson aboard Jervice‚Äôs flagship and hugged him in front of the entire crew. Royal Navy Admirals are not know to be a hugging bunch. He lost pieces of himself all over the place, fighting Napoleon. In the use Navy, he would have been entitled to five Purple Hearts all at the Rank of Captain and Above: Siege of Calvi - Lost an EyeBattle of Cape St Vincent - WoundedBattle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife - Wounded in the Arm, Partial AmputationBattle of the Nile - WoundedBattle of Trafalgar - Killed in Action The last one sealed his legend. He commanded a fleet that destroyed the Franco-Spanish fleets giving Britain rule of the seas until after World War I. At the time, the British government and pubic assumed the Franco-Spanish fleet was on it‚Äôs way to Northern France to pick up Napoleon‚Äôs Grand Army which the British Army had no hope of possibly stopping once it landed. So, Nelson saved Britain. What they didn‚Äôt know was that Napoleon had already canceled the invasion of Britain, and had ordered his forces to Austria to face a Russo-Austrian alliance before Trafalgar. But it was not common knowledge and he died a hero saving Britain. Even his last words, upon hearing the battle had been won as he lay dying, ‚ÄòThank Got I was able to do my duty‚Äô In the Borg invasion episode of Star Trek the Next Generation, it was said that Nelson established the tradition of a Captain touring the ship before a hopeless battle."},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"Start from scratch to rise as a phoenix !!"},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor. Should I let him?","output":"One thing to consider is the condition of the floor. In a household that keeps the floor clean and doesn‚Äôt wear outdoor shoes at home, it‚Äôs fine to sleep on the floor, compared to a household that has mice, silverfish, cockroaches, spiders, ants, etc., skittering across the floor at night. It‚Äôd be bad to let a child sleep on the floor if disease-spreading creatures are likely to be crawling on the floor (and thus on the child). Another thing to consider is why. There might be some other problem that needs to be addressed. Also, could something else be a good compromise? Would a mattress on the floor work since a bed doesn‚Äôt? How about a futon, towel, sheet, etc.? We leave sweat, oils, and skin cells behind when we sleep, and that can build up. If someone‚Äôs sleeping in a bed, we can just throw the bedsheets into the laundry machine and it‚Äôs clean again. That doesn‚Äôt work when they‚Äôre sleeping on the floor. It‚Äôs okay if they‚Äôre doing it only once in a while, but it can make housekeeping even more of a chore if they sleep directly on the floor every night. A vacuum cleaner doesn‚Äôt pull all dirt, dust, dead skin cells, etc. out of the carpet, and the build-up of such things can cause health problems. Another potential problem is that someone sleeping on the floor might get stepped on accidentally in the middle of the night. If a burglar were to be walking around in the dark, is the sleeping child out of the way or visible enough that the burglar wouldn‚Äôt step on the child by accident? If cleanliness and safety are taken care of and if there isn‚Äôt some other bigger reason why the child won‚Äôt sleep in bed that needs to be addressed, then it‚Äôs probably fine to let the child sleep on the floor for a while and just let the child grow out of it when they‚Äôre ready."},{"instruction":"Why are sovereign citizens obsessed with maritime admiralty law?","output":"Maritime or admiralty law is a real and distinct body of law and traditionally was conducted in special courts. During the colonial era, the British government increasingly used the admiralty courts to enforce their unpopular commercial laws and to punish smugglers: the judges were generally appointed by the British government (not the colonial legislatures), and the courts did not allow jury trials or many other procedural protections generally afforded to criminal defendants. The abuse of these courts was one of the major colonial grievances that led to the American Revolution. Under Article III, section 2 of the constitution, federal courts have jurisdiction over \\"all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\\". Sovereigns conflate admiralty cases ‚Äì that is, cases involving commercial shipping disputes or sailors' labor claims ‚Äì with the abusive British admiralty courts of the 18th century to conclude that modern federal courts are secretly lawless show trials."},{"instruction":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

(Lu 17:27, ftn) Local floods come and go in a matter of days; this one lasted over a year, the greater portion of which was required for the water to subside.

If only a comparatively small area was affected, why the need of bringing into the ark specimens of ‚Äúevery living creature of every sort of flesh‚Äù in order to ‚Äúpreserve offspring alive on the surface of the entire earth‚Äù?

So it helps them to keep alive late night. Please note that you cannot sit on the heated surface. People only goes out after sunset when weather becomes little cooler. Other types of work forces that have two shifts. First shift ends by 1.30-2.00 pm they will have two hours of sleep before second shift. Most women are not working so they need to go out for fresh air. I remember in Jeddah most people will stay up to midnight at cornice. This became now traditional and part of Saudi Arabian life.

It is generally not possible for an individual to obtain the call history of a mobile phone number without the consent of the owner of the phone. The call history for a mobile phone is typically maintained by the phone company and is considered private information. There are a few exceptions to this general rule. For example, law enforcement agencies may be able to obtain the call history of a mobile phone as part of a criminal investigation with a court order. In addition, some phone companies may allow customers to access their own call history through a self-service portal or by contacting customer service.

The best part about statistics is that you can use it it anyway to address your agenda. Transgender bathroom issue and harassment of women in workplace are two separate issues. You can be both trans friendly and also fight against harassment. AOC knows what things can tick the other side and give virtue signal her crowd.

Granite has spots like a granular appearance while marble has veins that ripple throughout its surface. Granite is a hard stone, and the absorption tendency of its surface is weak. If we discharge a lubricant on the surface of granite, it will not absorb. On the other hand, the porosity of marble makes it a very soft stone.

See, if you were able to convince a million people to give you a dollar, you would likely pay half of that for the chance at getting a million, i.e. the effort involved in contacting those million people (and more; since you won‚Äôt reach everyone you set out to, and not everyone will be both willing and able to give you a dollar)will not be worth the return. Then the tax man comes knocking. That‚Äôs only where the fun starts. Though I know this extends beyond the scope of the question, I think you still should read it: Anything that could potentially pay off a million bucks could just as easily pay out five million. Maybe ten, depending on the specifics. In fact, people have made far more with far less‚Ä¶.and a bunch of time and effort. But if you have it in mind to flip a million bucks out of something, you better be prepared to either spend a ton of money in a hurry or wait a really long time for a very great Idea to pay dividends; not because that goes for everyone, but because it goes for most of the few people who do succeed, and statistically you are most likely to end up like most of those few people if you do succeed. Which brings me to my final point: statistically, you will not succeed. You can have all your ducks in a row and elongated excretion. And even if you have talent and experience and connections on your side, you‚Äôre just competing with all the other people out there with all that and more. And there is always going to be someone with more. More talent, more money, more guts, whatever. You are very rarely going to be the anything in whatever room you are in; if you are, you‚Äôre in the wrong room. So you have to be good at something no one else is, and you have to figure out how to develop your advantages into a marketable skill. And then, finally, you have to make yourself available to those in a position to assist you. You have to be there with the answer; you have to be there with the coffee, if that‚Äôs what it takes. Be useful to those you wish to use. And don‚Äôt be dishonest. You don‚Äôt have to trace your parentage back to antiquity, but it helps if you are not a complete bastard. There are few more total ways of disrespecting a person sticking their neck out to help you‚Ä¶.and someone always is, even if you know nothing about it‚Ä¶.than to lie to them or withhold relevant information at a key time. Making a million bucks can be easy or difficult; but straight-up asking people for it has gotten so expensive that if you are raking in a million bucks in donations, you are competing with some of the largest gangsters on Earth.

If your son signed the lease when he was legally a minor and not able to enter into enforcable contracts, he best simply send a certified letter to the landlord stating such and instructing the landlord that he is not responsible for the lease for that reason and confirms that fact by that letter to make that clear. If your son is merely listed in the lease as one of the tenants (but did not sign the lease), then once again, a letter from the signed lessee (and perhaps also one from the son) to the landlord simply advising that the son is no longer a tenant will make the record clear should a future question arise about that (again, send such a letter certified mail and retain copies for yourself too)."},{"instruction":"What should writers know?","output":"The world‚Äôs most valuable skill is writing.

We have experienced a roller coaster ride all along as we have continued to learn from our wonderful users. We have listened to them and have continued to evolve features to improve team productivity with a view to enhancing the bottom line of our customers. We have more than a 1,000 organizations now that use Jumppl for managing their projects, teams and clients. We have indeed learnt a great deal from our users about all the wonderful ways that they have been using Jumppl for boosting the productivity of their marketing, sales, operations, engineering and support teams. Let‚Äôs take a look at these use cases so that you can replicate their wonderful experiences for achieving similar results. 1. Create Tasks while you are chatting with someone Let‚Äôs admit that all of us have been through this, you plan a project to perfection and then when you are letting your co-workers in on the details on chat, you feel that you forgot to add something or maybe there are some more tasks that need to be added to the Project. Ahh, you will have to switch from your chat application to your project management platform to make this happen‚Ä¶ Well not anymore. Jumppl Chat has an inbuilt facility to create new tasks for any project that you want while you are chatting all along. What‚Äôs more the recipient of the message gets automatically assigned to the task as well. 2. Get Progress Snapshots for all of your team members Productivity often takes a hit when there‚Äôs a lack of transparency within a team and the team members are in the dark about the work that‚Äôs being done by their peers. A lot of teams are now decentralized which can lead to similar scenarios. Jumppl has a very handy ‚ÄòAssigned Tasks‚Äô tab in the ‚ÄòTask & Projects‚Äô module which lets all the group members get a sneak peak of what the other members of the team are doing. So you will be able to see the tasks that are on the plate for a particular member for all the projects that you are a part of as well. 3.

Jumppl allows you to seamlessly integrate new hires into your org with a number of key features. You can create and assign specific onboarding projects for each employee and they can just go through the motions while completing all the tasks. No sweating that they might take a misstep because of a lack of guidance. So no-fretting over losing those performance super heroes just because they felt left out after joining the company. 4. You don‚Äôt need to switch between Apps anymore Switching between the apps can be a nightmare and can impact the team‚Äôs output. Most teams have different apps for Project management, team management, Document storage, chatting, timetracking and Client management. This arrangement often leads to siloing of information which in-turn leads to important info getting lost in the ensuing mess. There are tons of [LINKED_TEXT: chat applications] [URL: https://yourstory.com/mystory/e7fd935d2c-10-best-group-chat-app] out there but almost all of them are just that, a ‚ÄòChat application‚Äô. With Jumppl, you don‚Äôt have to use multiple apps for getting work done, as Jumppl handles Projects, Teams, Calendar, Chat, Document storage and clients through a unified platform this paving the way for a super productive team and the icing on the cake; you only have to pay for a single subscription rather for the whole lot of them. 5. Search across different modules One of the issues that our customers used to run into was the nuisance around finding relevant data spread across projects, chat and files storage. There was the local search available already for finding specific things from within each module but our community wanted something better to improve their productivity by reducing [LINKED_TEXT: clutter] [URL: https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2013/11/27/clutter-affects-productivity-can/]. The Jumppl Team prides itself on listening to our wonderful user-base and listen we did. We have launched the ‚ÄòGlobal Search‚Äô feature which allows the users to search within the Chat, Files and the Task modules from a single Dashboard. Reducing clutter from your office [LINKED_TEXT: increases productivity] [URL: https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/01/clean-office-increases-productivity.html] likewise reducing clutter in your project management platform. 6. Get notified in chat when a task is assigned to you Getting instantly notified when you are assigned tasks should be a no-brainer, but as it turns out users of one of the [LINKED_TEXT: biggest Tech companies] [URL: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams/Is-there-a-way-to-create-notifications-when-a-task-is-assigned/m-p/113462] have had issues around this. Jumppl has a very intuitive way of handling this, as soon as someone is assigned a task, they are simply sent an automatic chat notification notifying about this particular task. 7. @mention a user and they will notified straight away about a chat Say you are discussing something in a Group using group chat and you want the input of someone particular. What would you do? Maybe howler at them‚Ä¶ I am sure that you didn‚Äôt think of that J or did you. Jumppl has a more nuanced way of handling these situations, you simply need to use the ‚Äò@username‚Äô format and the user will be notified that their input is required. 8. ‚ÄúThe Pin bar changed the way I log things‚Äù Jumppl‚Äôs desktop app has been a revelation for our development team as well, the initial plan was to develop a desktop app on the lines of Slack, Basecamp and other similar apps. The desktop app started out as a simplistic chat application but it has evolved into a very effective platform. Unlike the traditional bigwigs of the project management space who either don‚Äôt have a desktop app or only have it for the sake of it, Jumppl‚Äôs desktop app mirrors most of the features of our web app. The desktop app has taken it a notch higher with the introduction of the ‚ÄòPin bar‚Äô. ‚ÄòPins‚Äô are meant to mimic the sticky-notes and you can ‚Äòstick‚Äô important projects, tasks, files, documents from the Jumppl web-app directly into the desktop app. The user can then open any pin by simply clicking on the required pin from the Pin-bar. The Jumppl‚Äôs user base has reported noticeable increases in productivity and throughput because of the Pin-bar in the desktop app. A lot of the users pin all of their to-do‚Äôs everyday and keep ticking them off as they get done with particular tasks. 9. Manage complex projects with Jumppl Subprojects Most professional projects are quite extensive and elaborate and require comprehensive project management platforms for managing them. Jumppl lets you manage ‚ÄòMilestones‚Äô or modules of such projects with Jumppl subprojects. Every project can have unlimited subprojects and this allows you to handle all sorts of project milestones & project types. 10. ‚ÄòFavourites‚Äô lets you save the most interesting things, It‚Äôs always handy to have a way of prioritizing certain assets over others and the ‚ÄòFavorites‚Äô lets you do exactly that. You can mark any project, task, folders, file or feed item as a favorite and can always comeback to them by clicking through to them via the ‚ÄòFavorites‚Äô section. 11. Quickly share a list of tasks and create a ‚Äòpost‚Äô for the clients Jumppl‚Äôs client portal is a thing of beauty or so we have been told by our wonderful userbase. One of many features of Jumppl‚Äôs client portal is the ability to share tasks from the Jumppl ‚ÄòWeb-App‚Äô to the Jumppl ‚ÄòClient Portal‚Äô, which lets the clients to see the progress of the different projects and to provide their feedback as the work progresses. This has lead to faster project turnaround times and has resulted in delighted clients for our userbase, which we consider a huge accolade for our team. The clients and the users can also post ‚ÄòStatus updates‚Äô, in the ‚ÄòFeed‚Äô section of the Client Portal, along with attachments to make the interaction that much more vivid and to provide a canvass for storytelling. 12. Daily email to update you on what has happened and what‚Äôs coming up Jumppl sends out daily & weekly progress emails to keep you in touch with the progress of all the projects that you are currently working on. Nothing boosts productivity more than getting reminded about slipping deadlines, or does it, our fabulous clients definitely think so. 13. Clients get automatically notified when you upload a doc or update a doc We have all been there, haven‚Äôt we, your client asks you about your response about their latest requirements and you don‚Äôt have a clue about that or maybe it‚Äôs the client that missed one of your emails. Might happen because you missed their latest email in the incessant chatter of incoming emails or maybe you asked for their response and didn‚Äôt get it in time. Whatever the reason this happens all too often in client facing environments and the Jumppl team decided enough was enough ( Yup, seriously J). Jumppl‚Äôs Client-Portal takes cares of these issues through its dedicated ‚ÄòFile‚Äô section which acts as a repository of information for all the documents that are exchanged with the clients. Whenever a document is posted in the ‚ÄòFile‚Äô section of the ‚ÄòClient Portal‚Äô, all the members of the respective client portal get notified so you can effectively say goodbye to all the problems associated with client communications. 14. Stops clients from asking you for files all the time Ta-da! And yes your clients won‚Äôt ask you to email that deliverable for the umpteenth time because they will have it sitting cozily in the ‚ÄòFile section‚Äô. 15. See who has already viewed the post It‚Äôs always nice to see whether everyone concerned read your status update or not, so that you don‚Äôt have to remind them again and again. Jumppl ‚ÄòFeed‚Äô displays the list of people who read your post to keep you in control; another productivity kicker eliminated! 16. + (Plus ) button to create something really fast ‚ÄòOne ring to rule them all‚Äô, errr, I meant one button ( Image of the plus button ) to manage most of your headaches. Well the ‚Äò+‚Äô button takes care of most of your work related chores like inviting your team members to Jumppl, inviting external members, creating a group or a client portal or creating a ‚ÄòTask‚Äô, an ‚Äòevent‚Äô or a ‚ÄòNote‚Äô.

A Muslim should have faith in Kuran and follow the preachings and does not mould that preaching to suits them, so the Hindus. He is a true human being. He respects the humanity and follow the principals well settled by the religious scriptures. It is illogical to read the scriptures of each and every religion and then follow them. It will make the humanity confused one. I don't feel any religion has the spirit to kill any creature of God, hurt any body, kill any body spread violence and so on. Think of Pakistan and Bangla Desh where Hindus population has decreased very fast. Both these countries muslim countries. In Bangla Desh on Dewali hindu temples broken, house of Hindus set in fire. In Modi raj does this happen? Muslims population is growing by percentage, even one of the muslim leaders, when eight terrorists absconded from the Jail and were killed in an encounter wanted investigation by Supreme Court. Why? Because all were Muslims. He did not talk about the Policeman to whom they killed while breaking open the jail. Have you put any question to such persons?

Though In R&AW few can join (I am not counting SFF in it) though in selected branches (Signalman goes to Aviation research centre Arm of Cab.sec on deputation and likewise military intelligence guys too in different branches). The reason is simple :- 1 ) IB is hardcore domestic intelligence organization and often involved in political intelligence too. Involving Army officers in domestic political intelligence is considered threatning by Bureaucratic and political dispensation. The IB during its inception was run by Army guys, but post independence IB became too powerful (with political intelligence branch becoming the law into themselves) and with primacy of Political intelligence, the Army guys moved out of IB permanently. Now it's a police organization Where IPS dominates, many State police service officers of the Rank of DSPs and ADTNL.SPs too move in to be absorbed permanently (this is group A cadre of IB). Technical officers group A are recruited By UPSC through DCIO(deputy central intelligence officer) exam. 2 ) R&AW is external intelligence organization where any one from the 37 Central civil services(known as central staffing scheme service) can join on deputation and can be permanently absorbed. The service is then known as Research and Analysis service (RAS) and cadre of the officer is known as RAS cadre. The technical officers move in from DRDO and other such organization's and also recruited separately as Senior field officers (tech) and absorbed in RAS cadre. Many a times Senior field officer (SFO) are recruited from recently(last 3‚Äì4 yrs) selected batch of CAPF officers. From undersecretary and deputy secretary it's the civil servant which are recruited. The Army officers deputation are mainly restricted to technical branches(ARC, RRC) and operations(mainly all three branches of armed forces who have considerable experience intelligence comes on deputation). So far so good. Now comes the main part : Army has its own Branch of intelligence known as military intelligence (directorate of military intelligence) and defence intelligence agency (DIA) which works in tandem with R&AW and IB(In north east and Jammu and Kashmir as well as border states). They operate in much professional way and much more dreaded then IB or R&AW guys. Though the mandate is 25 kms from the border or L.O.C but with growing security threats they have been involved in ops all over the country and abroad. Many units in military intelligence are ultra secretive and many don't know about its existence. They mostly work in close tandem with R&AW.

Australia is a no excuses country, if you didn‚Äôt plan your retirement with a large Super that you can slowly wear down you are going to have to work but you will be paid well and again, the work is not hard. 2/3 of Australians over 65 get some form of pension but not that many get the full amount. USA - It‚Äôs a completely different deal. You start paying into Social Security (6.2%) at the age of 15 or whenever your 1st paid job on the clock begins. You and your employer combined pay 15.3% into Social Security system and Medicare with SS topped out at US160K after that no deductions. You have to work 40 quarters or 10 years combined to be eligible for any SS. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much, you just have pay. The more you pay in, the more you get back when you retire. Your 62 year old Brit would get a ‚Äòpartial‚Äô not full pension which is 66 in the USA but again this is just Social Security, not the other pensions. Your max is at age 70 but 95% have already taken their social security payment start before that age. Now for the kicker and why the USA is not so bad at all but why the pensions are burdening the economy. Many though not all double and triple dip. That means they have say a guaranteed union pension for the UAW or some other union from back in the day with huge memberships. Then they add social security = 2 pensions. Teachers if they were in 2 states get pensions from 2 states if they make it to 10 years min in each state + social security. Anyone that worked for a municipal govt doesn‚Äôt matter what you did from life guard at age 15 to part time secretary gets a pension as long as you make it 10 sometimes it takes 15 years. Millions in the USA have retired under such schemes and put together these little pensions to form a nice nest egg of at least 2 pensions sometimes 3 and on rare occasions 4 and ALL OF THEM ARE GUARANTEED. I have friends who have parents who are on combo pensions of over 100k per year and never worked a day in their lives. All due to spouse survivor benefits. Everyone and I mean everyone puts down the Americans as being miserly and tough on old people. Not true at all. The USA provides social security to over 60 million people millions of whom are 62 or younger. Do you get rich? No, but if you work the system, especially baby boomers who are or have retired when the unions were still strong, then you won and you won nicely. Enjoying their boats on lakes in Michigan and around the country and in Australia around the entire country, boats boats and more boats! Update: Sadly as many commenters have noted and I was a bit remiss to not highlight, these days are not only over, most in the future will be left in the USA with Social Security and that is it. I won‚Äôt go into the Superannuation vs 401K but suffice it to say, those who made it were a lucky generation. The future generations are far less secure and need to make money and put it away now as there might not be much later on."},{"instruction":"Why do Glocks and HiPoints look like they are rudimentary, and made for people who just want to say they own a gun?","output":"Hi point is just the ugliest thing to ever enter the world of handguns. They resemble a toy from the dollar store. Glock has never been my preference. The plastic makes the firearm lightweight causing unnecessary recoil. The likelihood of an average shooter hitting their target is significantly reduced. Also the Glock is easy to modify the trigger. Many inexperienced gun owners will initiate these three little steps causing a hairpin trigger. This has resulted in countless accidental shootings. These are the individuals that are out pistol whipping people grazing heads in the process. Your gangsters minus the gangster resume. I'd spend a couple hundred more and go for the HK, SIG, or FN. I have owned a 4th gen Glock 20 though. For a Glock it's a bigger and significantly heavier weapon. This is only in consideration of the power of any 10mm round. Surprisingly, it was controllable due to the design and physics. Something worth mentioning is the new G3. I purchased the new Taurus G3 full sized polymer gripped 9mm. I am very impressed with it. A huge improvement from the previous design by Taurus. I have the option with 2 10 round magazines. It's heavy, with single action rapid fire trigger, I'm able to discharge the entire clip in 5 seconds. It does have a tad bit more recoil than a typical 9mm, though controllable. It has decent springs, and the slide allows safety in chambering rounds. There's a place to attach a red dot underneath the trigger that is incorporated in it's design, and it's decent looking. For around 300 new in box, you can't complain. The only criticism I have is there is a tendency to jam. I keep my weapon cleaned and oiled appropriately. Broken in, I run into a jam every 50 rounds or so. I use SIGs 124 gr elite performance hollow point ammo. The firearm is rated for 115 so this is likely the dilemma. I've actually had a cartridge flip backwards entirely in the chambering mechanism. I was forced to hold the slide open and remove part of the cartridge with pliers inside the weapon to get it to a point of allowing me to empty it without damaging the firing pin. I immediately cleaned, oiled, inserted a fully loaded magazine and was very nervous firing it. I discharged 8 rounds allowing about 4 seconds in between the 1st and 2nd then immediate repetition for the other, no hiccups. I didn't care for the situation though, as it was a new and uncertain experience. I wouldn't suggest using 147 grain in it. Some people aren't comfortable with a 9mm without it. Ruger has always held such value with me as I can take my 9 and get the impact of a 40 with +P+ ammo. I noticed Walther has the Q4 steel framed weapon also +P rated. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable, definitely an advanced shooter amongst most women. I don't recommend Glock as a first pick. I never recommend Hi-point. I recommend a cylinder shaped object to lunge at the spleen over resorting to a Hi-point in fact."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"That pwm technique is used to create an illusion of fading leds. pwm controls how much time the signal is high and low ,duty cycle."},{"instruction":"medication always needed for ADHD no matter how good or bad your ADHD is?","output":"It's personal choice and also dependent on how much, or how little, having ADHD is negatively impacting your life.

Why & how compared in importance?","output":"The Battle of Stalingrad was the more important and decisive battle. It was the literal turning point of the European war: before that the Germans had suffered setbacks but kept advancing and capturing more territory. After Stalingrad the Germans were in retreat all the way back to Berlin, except for that brief period in spring and summer 1943. Stalingrad marked the end of the Stalin-enforced unprepared Soviet attacks (and the removal of the barely competent Marshal Timoshenko) and the beginning of more professional operations. It meant the failure of Germany‚Äôs last strategic option for defeating the Red Army. It meant that the Nazis had to abandon their plans for the German economy and institute a total war economy (which they, as Nazis do, still failed to get running for many months). Kursk, on the other hand, was a tiny thing, involving only six German armoured corps, all of them understrength. Its strategic value was negligible, just the encirclement of a few Soviet armies that the German forces were too weak to destroy anyway. The British alerted the Soviets to the German plans, but the Soviets were already digging the defensive lines and planting the minefields. The German plans were so obvious that they could just has well have been communicated without encryption: they had two and a half concentrations of armoured units on the eastern front, two of them being on either side of the Kursk salient and the other on the Mius further south. If the Germans were going to attack at all, it would be at Kursk. After some discussion in the Stavka, Stalin agreed to hold off the planned Soviet offensives and allow Hitler to stick his head in the noose. Over summer, Hitler agonised over the decision to launch the offensive, or call it off. And rightly so, because he was beaten threefold already. The battle couldn‚Äôt give him the strategic result he wantedHis spearheads were nowhere near strong enough (and wouldn‚Äôt get far)Both the base areas for his attack were planned targets for Soviet offensives too strong for the Germans to defend against By the time the Battle of Kursk started, it just was no contest. Within a month, the Soviets had swept clean and both Kursk and the German strongpoints at Oryol, Belgorod, Kharkov, and the Mius were more than 200 km behind the Soviet lines. The battered remaining German units weren‚Äôt thinking of anything beyond trying to get on the western side of the Dnepr and build defensive lines before the Soviets caught up with them."},{"instruction":"What is an effective way to teach a lesson for those who are slow to understand?","output":"Today we have the means to teach youngsters in novel and innovative ways. Slow learners are not all that different from other kids. They merely require a few minor adjustments here and there. We owe them just as much, regardless of how much they may or may not understand or reflect us. Although there are many other ways to define special needs, a general definition includes kids with profound emotional, intellectual, physical, or developmental challenges that limit their capacity to learn and socialize. These children require more support to operate at grade level because they don't fit into our standard educational system. Students who struggle to pick things up fast also need varying support at different times. In addition, due to their disability, these children require individualized or small-group instruction to meet their specific learning requirements. There are few ways following which teachers can help these students understand and grasp all the concepts quickly. Be open minded Most people aren't, so you need to be receptive to new concepts. Students who struggle to understand concepts quickly are sometimes labeled as \\"abnormal,\\" as society has understood what it means to be normal. There will always be exceptions, and that is something you must accept. Whether they have special needs or not, there will always be children who don't fit the stereotype. Don't let preconceived assumptions influence how you perceive a child's issues. Spend time with your students By their peers and teachers, certain students are frequently misunderstood and abused. To understand what motivates them, we need to spend time with them outside the classroom. Don't just presume that you understand their perspective. Take a look for yourself! It's preferable to have open lines of communication with your kids than to have a wall separating you from them. Have an effective communication Some students struggle with verbal and written comprehension, just like most kids. Finding a means to interact with your kids is crucial, but it isn't always simple. It can be quite difficult. Yet the benefit is worthwhile. It's wonderful when you can identify with your pupils' perspectives and know the best ways to meet their requirements. Speak with them and learn precisely where they are having issues. Give students a voice Many children find that sketching or images help them communicate more effectively. To help you comprehend what they are attempting to convey, you should encourage your pupils to doodle or draw the ideas they have in their work. This will enable them to communicate more successfully even if they cannot grasp what they are saying. Stay strongly centered on the student work Slow learners who find it difficult to grasp concepts rapidly become discouraged when their teacher does not take note of their work. They may not get why you are so upset when you see their work, but they want you to be aware of it and like it. Instead of allowing other things to divert your attention from your students' \\"failures,\\" try to remain focused on their work and triumphs. Be empathetic Not all students will comprehend or agree with your opinions on how they should be taught because you are not a mind reader. However, you can tell when students are confused because they will demonstrate it. Like any other employee, teachers need to have empathy for their kids. I know that dealing with children with difficulty learning or suffering is not always simple, but you must try. Remember that every student is unique, and they all have different needs. Here are just a few pointers for dealing with the most typical ones. Additionally, it's critical to keep in mind that not every student faces the same challenge and that there is no one best strategy to support their success."},{"instruction":"Do aloe vera plants use the same soil type as the jade plant?","output":"Yes.

We are talking about human biology and chemistry. Muscle building is more complex than just chugging protein shakes. Estrogen can help protect muscles against muscle damage and is often pivotal in muscle growth for women. When I swam in college, the girls often had an easier time recovering from long training sessions. Women also tend to have lower blood pressure during exercise which can help with oxygen distribution. Men have more muscle mass which may play a role in that slowed recovery. In short, men have more overall muscle and strength, but it comes at a cost too. Also, I‚Äôve always found the athletic look attractive. I always had a CrossFit crush on Sara Sigmundsd√≥ttir. Women can become quite strong and muscular in a natural way. Evolution has favored them having functional strength too. For the record, Sara is tested extensively. She's clean which a lot people struggle to accept. Crossfit athletes have a full anti-doping program (the above photo is taken just after a competition, hence the pump).

The sample size decision depends mainly on the precision you want in results and the variability within the population. For example, suppose one of the questions is what religion the person practices. If p fraction of the population practices some particular religion and your sample size is N, then you expect to observe Np responses indicating that religion, with a standard deviation of sqrt{Np(1-p}. If p is 10%, then in a sample of 100, you expect to get 10 responses of that religion, with a standard error of 3, or 30% of the expected value. With a sample size of 10,000, you expect to get 1,000 responses of that religion, with a standard deviation of 30, or only 3% of the expected value. Those calculations assume a perfect random sample, and perfect accuracy of response and transmission. In practice it can be harder to reach some kinds of people. For example, if a 10% religious minority tends to congregate in out of the way places and avoid contact with the majority, it might be hard to sample them in the exactly correct proportion of the population."},{"instruction":"Why are conservatives outraged when citizens get student loan relief, but are all for giant corporations being bailed out when they cannot repay their loans?","output":"Who says conservatives are for corporations being bailed out?"},{"instruction":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","output":"Ajay Devgn would scream \\"Jai Bajarangbali!\\" and break through the 5th dimension, after which he winks at the camera and says \\"Never underestimate the power of a common man\\", the movie would end with Brand and Cooper doing an item number, composed by YoYo Hansraj Zimmersingh."},{"instruction":"Are there any 9mm revolvers that have a capacity of 10 or more rounds?","output":"no"},{"instruction":"As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.

More on this later. After Gandhi appointed Nehru as the Prime Minister on behalf of the British, Nehru found himself having to consolidate power and dismantle challenges posed by Political Parties of enormous integrity and substance such as the Swatantra Party and Gandhi‚Äôs own demand that the Indian National Congress should be dissolved once Independence was attained. Keeping the Indian National Congress together against Gandhi‚Äôs wishes proved easy as Gandhi was dead and the ‚ÄúHindoo‚Äù lumpen and Brahmanas had been successfully blamed for this, thus weakening two sources of opposition to his regime at one stroke. Further, the Indian National Congress themselves comprised of corrupt persons like Nehru with an enormous appetite for personal pomp, pelf, pleasure, perversions, power and perpetuation over any kind of National interest, and were more than willing to pursue their greed, lust and sadism under the umbrella that Nehru provided. That the British had massacred or marginalized all genuine Nationalists and freedom fighters before handing the reins to Nehru was very helpful. To consolidate power thus fraudulently obtained, Nehru acted under the advise of seasoned former members of the now disbanded Indian Political Service (the British Gestapo in India) to consolidate his power: To create a Nouveau Kleptocracy that would be loyal to himself and have the wealth and means necessary to be meaningful beyond a mere suspension of morality and integrity. For this he passed an anti-corruption law that criminalized the victims of extortion (like Modi‚Äôs law) and encouraged loot and plunder through extortion. He also passed a plethora of communist laws and regulations which gave minions of the State the power to interfere with almost any activity or business for the purpose of extortion though ostensibly in ‚ÄúNational Interest‚Äù. He was careful to thwart the attempts of the Swatantra Party to make education upto tenth standard compulsory to vote and contest elections in order to keep the majority vote in the hands of those he could fool and befuddle with ease. He led the Indian National Congress to quash the proposal to make corruption a capital offense punishable as treason and treason laws tabled by the Swatantra Party.To weaken or destroy anybody with influence or power so that there would be none to challenge him. To this end, Nehru set the minions of the State to harass and diminish the Princes, the Brahmanas and Independent or Nationalist minded industrialists, bankers and businessmen and provided his minions with laws to do so. For example, he passed a draconian and enlarged Arms act (like Modi) that made the personal arms kots of the princes and landed gentry illegal and led to the confiscation of priceless antiques apart from their ancestral heritage. He brought in land ceilings. Nehru also brought in excise acts that led to the confiscation of liquor reserves of the Princes and their ability to throw parties for their followers and retainers. Nehru Nationalized the temples and the Savarna Commonwealth thus, effectively, marginalizing the Brahmanas and disintegrating the Savarna as a force electorally or otherwise.To continue the British legacy of ‚ÄúDivide to rule‚Äù by playing to Dravidism, Dalitism, Akalism, and pampering the so called minorities (Christians and Moslems) with enormous privileges and entitlements while fanning fear in their hearts that this would all vanish but for their patron, the Indian National Congress. He buttressed this by creating different laws for different sections of society. The resultant inequality under law and lawful inequities corroded the rule of law and replaced it with corruption both lawful and otherwise thus making corruption the sole purpose and source of power in India. Translating power into wealth and wealth into power through serried ranks and files of Kleptocrats became the form and content of the Indian Rapeublic. An easy enough accomplishment for Nehru as appealing to and harnessing lust, greed, envy and sadism to recruit partners in crime and so consolidate and expand power is something the Indian Political Service had distilled from British practices across three centuries and which lay at the heart of far older cults such as Islam or Christianity. This then is the foundation of the Indian empire that succeeded the British Empire in India in 1947 and has made Corruption and Reservations the leit motif of the Indian Rapeublic, which when conjoined strengthen the inequality under law that makes a mockery of the words secular and democracy. India is not secular or a democracy. These are legal fictions like the British made ‚ÄúHindooism‚Äù. India is a Kleptocracy. The sine qua non of both secularism and democracy are equality under law and equity for all citizens regardless of any socio-metric grouping. India enshrines inequality under law and exceptions to the rule of law in the Constitution to steal from some for the benefit of others on the basis of caste, tribe, religion, geography, extraneous gratifications and proximity to power.

Oda sensei has demonstrated about Roger that he never got defeated in his entire life. In the whole journey of Roger, he faced many powerful opponents like Edward Newgate, Monkey D. Garp, Golden Lion Shiki, Rocks D. Xebec, and many more, and none of them ever conquered him. We have seen in the series that Edward Newgate single-handily destroyed the Marine Ford. Also, we have seen that the single punch of Garp stopped Marco, the Pheonix. They all were legendary and had the power to conquer the World. But none of them could ever defeat Gol D. Roger. In this way, we can estimate how powerful Gol D. Roger was. We still don‚Äôt know the power of his devil fruit. But we know that he was the master of all three Haki.

The main difference between the two versions is that Windows 10 Home is the basic version of Windows 10, while Windows 11 Pro is the more advanced version. Windows 10 Home is the version of Windows 10 that comes pre-installed on most PCs. It is designed for users who want a basic OS that can handle typical tasks like web browsing, email, and word processing. It includes features like Cortana, Windows Hello, Windows Defender, and the Microsoft Store. Windows 11 Pro is designed for users who need more advanced features such as virtualization, domain join, remote desktop, and more. It also includes features like Hyper-V, BitLocker, and Group Policy. It is also more secure than Windows 10 Home, as it includes additional security features such as AppLocker and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. In terms of pricing, Windows 10 Home is usually cheaper than Windows 11 Pro. However, it is important to consider that Windows 11 Pro also comes with additional features and security updates that may be worth the extra cost. Ultimately, it is up to the individual user to decide which version of Windows 10 is best for their needs. Note: If you're on the lookout for great deals on authentic products then the Microsoft partner website is an ideal destination for you to visit. I recently came across a post on the website and found that a lot of people had endorsed the post's views. What's more, the prices of the products mentioned in the post were quite competitive.

One would be shocked to learn how the power of the Monarch is limited by idiot apparatchiks but, for Charles III to override all that would be quite trivial. Accepting a knighthood or other honor from the UK Honors System is another matter.

It has the potential to significantly benefit your business by boosting brand visibility, engagement, and ultimately driving growth. Here's how: 1. Enhanced Brand Exposure: Social media platforms provide a vast and diverse audience. By strategically crafting and sharing relevant content, you can expose your brand to a much larger pool of potential customers than traditional marketing methods. 2. Targeted Advertising: Social media platforms allow you to target your ads to specific demographics, interests, and behaviors. This precision targeting ensures that your marketing efforts are reaching the right people, increasing the likelihood of conversion. 3. Engagement and Interaction: Social media offers a two-way communication channel. You can directly engage with your audience through comments, likes, shares, and direct messages. This interaction helps build a loyal customer base and fosters trust in your brand. 4. Content Showcase: Through various formats like posts, images, videos, and stories, you can showcase your products or services in a visually appealing and engaging manner. This helps potential customers understand your offerings better. 5. Driving Website Traffic: Social media posts can include links to your website, leading to increased traffic. This can lead to higher conversion rates as visitors are already interested in what you have to offer. 6. Data Insights: Social media platforms provide valuable insights into audience behavior, preferences, and engagement metrics. Analyzing this data can guide your marketing strategy, helping you refine your approach over time. 7. Brand Authority: Consistent and valuable content sharing positions your business as an authority in your industry. Sharing insights, tips, and news demonstrates your expertise and builds credibility. 8. Word-of-Mouth Amplification: Social media encourages users to share content they find interesting. Positive word-of-mouth spreads rapidly online, giving your brand exponential exposure. 9. Cost-Effective: Compared to traditional advertising, social media marketing often offers a more cost-effective way to reach your target audience. You can allocate your budget strategically based on platform performance and audience response. 10. Adaptable Campaigns: Social media allows you to adjust your campaigns in real-time. If you notice a particular approach isn't yielding desired results, you can modify your strategy promptly. In a nutshell, social media marketing is a dynamic tool that enables you to reach, engage, and convert potential customers in ways that traditional marketing methods can't match. By leveraging its various features and benefits, you can create a strong online presence, foster customer relationships, and drive business growth.

My cable-activated shifting can be repaired in the field if something happens, and I don‚Äôt need to charge it (or worry that it‚Äôll run out of juice, or short out).

I have several old wheels and old bikes, and if I ever want to ride but realize that I have a wheel problem (broken spoke, bent rim, wonky hub), I can quickly/easily harvest an old wheel off another bike and still go riding with virtually no delay.

Suppose you are following a distant galaxy in an accelerating universe. The galaxy is far enough away so that over the eons (many, many billions of years) its speed relative to us is gradually increasing. As a result, you would see that galaxy under increasing redshift, and consequently, everything that happens there will appear in slow motion. It will be harder and harder to observe, because of the increasing distance and increasing redshift (which also further reduces the intensity of its light). But suppose you could nonetheless follow that galaxy for a lot longer (we are now talking trillions of years or more.) The result? You would never see the galaxy disappear. Eventually, its luminosity may fall below the threshold of your instruments, but if your instruments could be improved, the galaxy would reappear. The moment when it would cross your cosmological event horizon remains forever in your future. (That is a common theme with event horizons; after all, they are things in spacetime, not space.) So if we had billions of years at our disposal, we would indeed see the accelerating recession of distant galaxies, but we would never see them cross that horizon. In reality, we have at most a few hundred years of astronomical observations, less than a hundred, really, when it comes to systematic observation of spectra of extragalactic objects. Way too short a time frame to see the acceleration directly. We deduce the acceleration by observing different objects at different distances and redshifts."},{"instruction":"What are some unique startup ideas for India?","output":"As per the flagship initiative of the Government of India (Startup India), these are the current problems our country is facing. 1.)

Even after producing more food than it needs, 194 million people go hungry in India every day and as a result, India ranks a disappointing 103 among 119 countries in the Global Hunger Index. Idea ‚Äì Solving the issue by providing solutions to reduce/eradicate the problem by creating sustainable storage solutions and transportation facilities, creating a re-distribution network for leftover food from weddings, parties and events. One can also work on setting up compost plants. 2.) Problem ‚Äì Women Safety - A report by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has ranked India as the most dangerous country for women, ahead of war-torn countries like Afghanistan and Syria. Idea ‚Äì Creating or exploring women's safety measures like wearables or gadgets or even applications to inform the police or people in case of an emergency.

A: In one of Dr. Oliver Sacks‚Äô books, there is a story called ‚ÄúThe Last Hippie‚Äù, a true tale of a patient that developed a brain injury which prevented him from forming new memories. For decades of his life, anything new that happened to him would be almost immediately forgotten, and he could only remember that portion of his life up to the earlier 1970‚Äôs, when he was in his early 20‚Äôs. So he went through the rest of his life thinking it was still the early 1970‚Äôs, and thinking he was still in his early 20‚Äôs. This, naturally, presented problems, because certain things would happen that would, temporarily at least, clue him in to the that fact that it was much later than that, and this would be highly upsetting to him, at least until he forgot the new information and went back to his illusion. Seeing his aging face in the mirror - very upsetting. Seeing the date on a newspaper - very upsetting. Seeing how a childhood friend had aged - very upsetting. Telling him that actually, Grandma died 24 years ago - very upsetting. So the kindest thing for this patient was to shield him from things that would be very upsetting, and allow him to live peacefully in his own little perpetual land of the 70‚Äôs. What makes sense for people with serious cognitive impairment is try to avoid exposing them to information that will be traumatic to them, and try to keep them reasonably content - even if that involves less than full honesty. I doubt that telling an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient that he or she was ‚Äúvacationing in some awesome place‚Äù would work. But if it did work, and it kept the patient happy, I don‚Äôt see why it should not be done."},{"instruction":"What do you think of the 3/21/22 CBC report that the NDP has agreed to keep Trudeau's Liberal Party in power until 2025?","output":"Nothing.

Vocal exercises are great for improving your breathing, which is what helps you sing in tune.

Of course, the other reason to do vocal exercises is so that you can get rid of bad habits in your voice‚Äîlike straining it or holding back anything from coming out! Vocal exercises can help you sing better by improving the tone, quality, and flexibility of your voice. It also helps you strengthen your embouchure (the way you produce sound with your mouth) so that each note sounds clear and distinct.

I have seen this solution in one old Russian book of math problems: Start with any Gaussian integer, i.e. a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers. Let‚Äôs say [math]3+2i[/math]. First, we can write: [math]3^2+2^2=13^1[/math]. Obvious, surely. [math]13[/math] is the norm of our number: square of its absolute value. But then, we take that Gaussian integer and square it: [math](3+2i)^2=5+12i[/math] And that leads to second equation: [math]5^12+12^2=13^2[/math]. Why? Because product of two complex numbers has norm that is equal to the product of norms of those numbers. We can calculate higher and higher powers of [math]3+2i[/math], and norms of the resulting numbers will be successive powers of [math]13[/math]: [math](3+2i)^3=-9+46i; 9^2+46^2=13^3[/math] (should be [math](-9)^2[/math], but it doesn‚Äôt really matter‚Ä¶)[math](3+2i)^4=-119+120i; 119^2+120^2=13^4[/math][math](3+2i)^5=-597+122i; 597^2+122^2=13^5[/math][math](3+2i)^6=-2035‚Äì828i; 2035^2+828^2=13^6[/math][math](3+2i)^7=-4449‚Äì6554i; 4449^2+6554^2=13^7[/math][math](3+2i)^8=-239‚Äì28560i; 239^2+28560^2=13^8[/math][math](3+2i)^9=56403‚Äì86158i; 56403^2+86158^2=13^9[/math][math](3+2i)^10=341525‚Äì145668i; 341525^2+145668^2=13^10[/math] You can start from any Gaussian integer and raise it to whatever power you want.

No. The Bible says: And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: - Hebrews 9:27 I‚Äôll just be brutally honest with you, there is no scripture that mentions purgatory, and there is no scripture or any chain of scriptures that really teaches that once a person dies that they can be saved after death by virtue of what people in this life are doing. And the teaching of purgatory, that the priests can pray or someone can make a donation to the church and get someone out of hell really grew up about a thousand years after Christ and it became, quite honestly, it became a scheme for the church to basically capitalize on controlling salvation, or trying to capitalize on the idea that they control salvation. It comes from the word ‚Äòpurge‚Äô and supposedly, you‚Äôre not quite good enough for heaven yet, but you‚Äôre going to go through a little bit of burning to get any little sin that might be left burned out, or boiled out, and how long you boil might not only depend on how bad you were but how people are praying for you. Well, that is so contrary to the teachings of the Bible. Once you die you take your record with you. People are not rewarded based on how others are praying for them once they die. People take their record with them to their grave that they‚Äôll meet in the resurrection and the judgment, and purgatory is just not found in Scripture. It is really a teaching that came from pagan tradition.

I had already done so with other adult-y products, but I sought the benefits from CBD; this oil has been known for a broad range of health benefits, ranging from helping anxiety/PTSD to alleviating severe physical problems. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and to this day I'm terrified of trying out medication, so I figured why not try this out. I ordered myself a vape pen and CBD from a company I found on Instagram that always posted their customers claiming how the oil did wonders on them. My first day vaping, I noticed an automatic difference. Within a 10 minute mark, I felt at ease, as if I were just out of a calming stroll, and my anxious thoughts didn't bother me at all throughout the day of vaping. Now, I have days where I'll be too depressed and convinced to not even make use of the vape, but every time I start back on it I automatically feel good. In other words, I started vaping because I wanted to get an experience out of it, and for the sake of my mental health. I have no regrets, and encourage anyone to try vaping CBD."},{"instruction":"w often do popular Quora users go anonymous?","output":"Almost never. First of all, I don‚Äôt believe in anonymity. For me, there‚Äôs no such thing as being anonymous. People will always know the identity, at least, some people would know. So everything I wrote down, regardless in my private PC or online, anonymous or with my name attached, I write it down with the mind that someday I‚Äôll stand by my words either defend it or apologize for it. With this mentality, I wouldn‚Äôt write/say things I‚Äôm not comfortable standing by. I wouldn‚Äôt write about ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù in anonymity thinking no one would know. The answers I wrote anonymously were personal experiences about my past relationships and work experiences about companies I worked for. Something I feel that if I write with my name attached, I‚Äôd attract a lot unwanted attention both privately and professionally. But if Quora lifted anonymity, I have no problem standing by my words. In fact, for the past few years, I don‚Äôt think I have ever wrote anything under anonymity. It become more and more clear to me that if I‚Äôm not willing to write this content under my own name, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt write it in the first place. If I don‚Äôt want to be held accountable for my words, the words have no value and shouldn‚Äôt be put out there. If I‚Äôm afraid of these words reflect poorly on me, then writing it under anonymity is just cowardice. It‚Äôs not about upvote or popularity, it‚Äôs about personal principle. Just want to be clear, I‚Äôm not against anonymity. I‚Äôm not saying other people who go under anonymity are all cowards or people without principle. I understand the necessity of anonymity for an online community. I understand people sometimes want to hide their names when talking about intimate and work related problems. And for people from other part of the world where talking about a certain topic or identify as certain group of people might bring real danger to themselves, anonymity is crucial for them to make their voice heard. But I live in US. My freedom of Speech is protect by law. There‚Äôs no reason whatsoever for me to go anonymous. And if you live in US, and you want to ask about questions on Femi-nazi ruined your life or BLM movement being a violent hate group, there‚Äôs no reason for you to go anonymous either, asshole."},{"instruction":"What are some unique startup ideas for India?","output":"E-commerce platform for local artisans and craftsmen: India has a rich tradition of art and craft, and many artisans and craftsmen produce unique and high-quality products.

So in other words, you need to search for gift card apps that offer the best referral program. You then need to give your unique referral code to as many people as you can by promoting it via social media etc, and watch the points pile in! After searching numerous apps that pay you, taking into account their referral programs, the gift cards they offer, and whether or not they allow you to earn PayPal cash, I've found one of the best is AppKarma. Available for both Android and iOS devices, AppKarma offers PayPal cash and gift cards for iTunes, Google Play, Amazon and numerous others, as well as a great referral program. AppKarma's referral program offers 30% of what your referrals earn, they also get 300 points when they use your invite code. I've tried and tested AppKarma and redeemed PayPal cash!

For some bloggers, earning any money is considered a success, while others make thousands of dollars per month. If you want to monetize your blog through advertising, you'll need to consider both the cost per click (CPC) of your ads and your traffic volume. CPC rates vary widely depending on your niche and the type of advertisers you're able to attract, but generally speaking, higher CPC rates will result in higher earnings. Traffic volume will also affect your earnings potential - the more visitors you have coming to your site, the more chances you have of someone clicking on an ad.

Especially traders who rely on indicators are often rule-based, indicator strategies usually require certain values, developments or standings on their indicators before an entry signal exists. Automated trading strategies are always purely rule-based since conventional algorithms cannot think for themselves and, therefore, need exact parameters that signal them when they have to enter a trade. PROS: Rules can eliminate the impacts emotions and psychology often have. If you have fixed parameters for entering trades, your trading style is less subjective and easy to replicate. CONS: Purely rule-based strategies often have a hard time adapting to changing market conditions and while such strategies perform well under certain conditions, they fail completely when market conditions change. Discretionary Trading The discretionary trading system adapts to changing market conditions. Such methods require a high level of personal analysis and depend heavily on continuous research. Entry signals and how trades execute their trades changes continuously since markets always change. PROS: Discretionary strategies can adapt to changing market conditions and traders can react faster when markets suddenly change. CONS: Discretionary traders often use their approach as an excuse to be less strict about the way they approach trading. The absence of strict rules does not mean that a trader is purely trading based on assumptions or gut feeling, but that he has to assess current market conditions and adapt to his style.

Before knowing importance , know the best academy who offers best maritime courses such as 1. MVVS Maritime Academy (India) 2. Massachusetts Maritime Academy (USA) 3. Australian Maritime College (Australia) 4. Marine Engineering and Research Institute (India) 5. Tolani Maritime Institute (India) Here are some key reasons why calculus is important in a maritime course: Ship maneuvering and navigation: Calculus is used to analyze the motion of a ship, including its speed, acceleration, and trajectory. Differential calculus helps in determining rates of change, which is essential for ship maneuvering, calculating course corrections, and predicting the ship's position over time.Ship stability and buoyancy: Calculus is applied to understand the stability and buoyancy of a vessel. Integral calculus is used to calculate the areas and volumes of ship compartments, which are crucial for determining the vessel's displacement and stability characteristics. This information is essential for ensuring safe operations and preventing capsizing or listing.Fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics: Calculus is fundamental to the study of fluid flow and hydrodynamics, which are essential in marine engineering. Differential calculus helps in analyzing fluid behavior, such as the velocity and acceleration of water flow around a ship's hull. Integral calculus is used to calculate hydrodynamic forces acting on a vessel, such as lift, drag, and wave resistance.Electrical systems and power generation: Calculus is employed in analyzing electrical circuits and power systems aboard ships. Differential calculus helps in understanding the behavior of electrical variables such as current, voltage, and power flow. It is used to calculate rates of change in these variables and solve differential equations related to circuit analysis.Applied mechanics and structural analysis: Calculus is utilized in analyzing forces, stresses, and deformations in maritime structures. It helps in solving differential equations related to mechanical systems and calculating integrals to determine moments, shears, and deflections in ship structures. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring the integrity and safety of maritime vessels.Optimization and efficiency: Calculus is employed to optimize various aspects of maritime operations, including fuel efficiency, route planning, cargo loading, and scheduling. Optimization techniques, based on differential and integral calculus, allow for the determination of optimal solutions that minimize costs or maximize performance. Overall, calculus provides the mathematical foundation necessary for analyzing and solving complex problems in maritime engineering, navigation, hydrodynamics, and ship stability. It enables maritime professionals to understand and manipulate variables, make accurate predictions, and make informed decisions related to the design, operation, and safety of ships and marine systems."},{"instruction":"What‚Äôs your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","output":"Never drink alcohol on a date."},{"instruction":"Without looking at a map, how well can you draw the shape of your country?","output":"Well, worth a try for sure.

This Myth this is not entirely true. But the research has shown that we can use max 10‚Äì20% of our brain. Some researchers have estimated that more than 60 percent of the brain consists of \\"neural dark matter,\\" or neurons that have no apparent purpose and seem unresponsive to common stimuli. If we take human evolution into accounts, our develop this magnificent ability of reasoning merely 70 thousand years ago. Considering nearly 2.5 million years of human evolution 70k is very very small fraction. That means nearly 2.5 million years we were just like other animals with limited brain capacity & thinking ability. Modern humans sport a brain averaging 1,200‚Äì1,400 cubic centimetres. brain accounts for about 2‚Äì3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body‚Äôs energy when the body is at rest. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, & encompasses 1200‚Äì1400 CC area. For using our 100% of our brain it size also need to expand which will make our head very large, which will be not supported by our rest of body due to inappropriate brain to body proportion. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, imagine we started to use 100% of brain power, than we have to provide constant food supply to keep it working otherwise it will just absorb all the energy of body and create condition of death oftenly, because we can't feed our body every seconds of time. 100% brain uses will need so much nutrients, blood supply, oxygen etc that it will create deficit in rest of body & start to absorb as much as it can from rest of body which will eventually kill us. So it's neither good nor possible to use 100% of brain. But let's imagine we have started to use 100% without any side effects or death. Than we will be able to create so many things, our Civilization will become too much advance in terms of Science, religion, psychology and so on. We might be able to develop some alien technologies, like one you have seen in movies etc But still we can't create energy because of universal law that energy neither be created nor be destroyed. So we might not be able to create something like entire separate human universe. So even we start to use 100% brain our options will be limited. No matter how much advanced you became you can never overtake universe or nature.

It mainly comes down to the UK being far less religous than the US and even if you are religous here it's a private matter that you don't go shouting from the roof tops. When you look at conservatives in America the majority are proud christians who haven't actually read much of the bible, yet love the bigoted parts their minister screams at them from pulpt. It‚Äôs due to them being ignorant sheep that don't even know that Liviticus also says along with sodomy, triming your beard is a sin, but what's a bit hypocrisy if you're in a cult. Ending abortion and being anti gay marriage are ideologies directly from religous senators in the bible belt. The death penalty is blatant hypocrisy for comservative ‚Äòchristians‚Äô given god commanded ‚Äòthou shalt not kill‚Äô. Gun rights are more constiutional than religous, but unlike what most Americans believe, you can own guns in the UK. It's just far more regulated which was catalysed after a school shooting in the 90s.

To sack Nagumo would be a public admission of his failure. As the war went on, and the losses mounted. The number on men competent for command dwindled. The Japanese viewed Nagumo as the better choice compared to what was available. Public relations were tightly controlled. It was one thing to lose a commander in battle but another to sack him for incompetence. Sacking would not fit the narrative being given to the public. There also is the issue of the rivalry with the Army. The IJN would do nothing that would give the Army the upper hand.

Especially in the portables area. How many of their customers have both Macs and/or Pcs & iPads? Plenty. Would you buy an iPad if you had a touch screen on a MacBook? I doubt it. Which is how Microsoft is hoping to lure potential ‚Äúpad‚Äù customers back to M appliances such as Surface. In response to Brian & Glyn regarding the merger or not of iOS & MacOS I'd point out that all of Apple‚Äôs products run on a version of OS X. (ok, now MacOS) customized for that product. Apple has proven very adept at being able to transition their OS, whatever they call it. From running OS9 under OS X to converting Next from Motorola processers to Intel to PowerPC and back to Intel, Jobs was pushing Unix in whatever direction he needed at the time. What is being witnessed now is the transition of the Macs interface to resembling that of iOS. Apple is intent on keeping those customers who purchased Macs due to the halo effect from iOS devices by insuring they find a familiar UI. I think it's interesting that iOS devices are actually closer to Job‚Äôs original vision for the Mac in that they are closed to the average user in both software and hardware. Although they can't make toast, yet.

However, there have been concerns about the safety of food cooked in a microwave oven and its impact on our health. As a chef with years of experience, I can share some insights on this topic. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence that suggests that food cooked in a microwave oven is harmful to our health. Microwaves work by producing electromagnetic waves that generate heat, causing the food to cook. This method of cooking does not add any harmful chemicals to the food, nor does it remove any essential nutrients. However, there are certain things to keep in mind when cooking in a microwave oven to ensure that the food is cooked properly and safely: Use microwave-safe containers - Certain types of plastic and paper products can release harmful chemicals when heated in the microwave, which can then leach into the food. Always use containers that are labeled as microwave-safe.Follow cooking instructions - Most microwaveable foods come with cooking instructions that specify the time and power level for cooking. It is important to follow these instructions to ensure that the food is cooked evenly and thoroughly.Stir and rotate food - Stirring and rotating the food during cooking helps to distribute the heat evenly, ensuring that the food is cooked properly.Use a food thermometer - To ensure that the food is cooked to the right temperature, use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the food. The USDA recommends that meats be cooked to a minimum temperature of 165¬∞F (74¬∞C)."},{"instruction":"What is the cutest incident you had with your crush?","output":"After reading so many answers from everyone regarding their crushes i finally have courage to tell u guys.(‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°\`‚ùÅ) so here we go‚Ä¶.. me and my crush were in same class from class 5th at first i don‚Äôt like him at all but gradually i started liking him (stupid me).We became friends when we were in 8th standard.

There seems to be a significantly larger portion of engineering students in India than in the US. Is the perception of engineering different? If so, why?","output":"You already have a lot of historical context. I will add on to that. 1) Not many alternative optionsSome of the best known colleges/universities in India at under-graduation level primarily teach engineering and are mostly residential programmes. Most of these follow a very student driven extra-curricular culture which results in an overall grooming of the students in general, and they come to be in demand. 2) Demand for quantitative aptitudeThe Indian economy is increasingly service and manufacturing oriented. In both these setups, there is increased dependency on data and analytics. The IT ecosystem in India also adds to the data bias. With this bias, there is an increasing demand for people with analytical abilities. Engineers are the easiest recruits in such cases and hence there is a huge pull from the market 3) Soft skills are under-ratedSoft skills are still seen as a luxury when it comes to recruiting in most traditional jobs in India. Although companies are increasingly claiming that they look for EQ, soft skills and a rounded personality is usually only secondary and tertiary traits that employers look for. In situations and companies where a certain personality maturity is expected, companies prefer to go after management graduates who are in equal abundant supply in India. 4) Risk averse parentsGiven the historical context already detailed in other answers, the economic growth story for India is still only 15 - 20 years old. In most cases, the generation before the current one grew up with limited resources and in environments where stable jobs were a big deal. So, this generation has been raising their children to study for stable jobs that offer financial security above everything else. 5) Autonomy and choice are still a dreamIndia has traditionally lived in large families where the elders were seen to have the right to make decisions for the younger ones. With that mindset, even the current generation has not fully learnt to be independent enough to make life decisions, especially in their teens. So the drive to explore is really missing and most students wake up to their dreams only during or after their graduation years 6) View of education as means to a careerPost-independent India has not really come to appreciate the value of education as an end in itself. The love of learning and exploration has not been encouraged. With limited infrastructure, obtaining degrees became such a precious thing that people begun to have a utilitarian view to education. Indian societies could not afford the luxury of studying for the sake of learning until it had a measurable tangilbe expectation of result at the end of it. As a result, specialization became to be valued and studying for professions like engineering, medicine, law became coveted. Thankfully, people are realizing the need for change.

Here are some methods and tools you can use to debug your WordPress website: Enable WordPress Debugging: To enable WordPress debugging, open your website's wp-config.php file (located in the root directory) and look for the following line: define('WP_DEBUG', false); Change it to: define('WP_DEBUG', true); This enables WordPress debugging mode and displays PHP errors, warnings, and notices on your website. Additionally, you can add the following lines to the wp-config.php file to log the errors to a debug.log file: define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true); define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false); View Debug Logs: After enabling debugging, navigate to the wp-content directory and look for a debug.log file. This file will contain a log of any PHP errors, warnings, or notices encountered on your website. Review the log to identify the issues and address them accordingly. Use Browser Developer Tools: Inspect your website using the browser developer tools (usually accessible by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting \\"Inspect\\" or \\"Inspect Element\\"). The developer tools allow you to examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, as well as view network requests, console logs, and errors. Check the console tab for any JavaScript errors that may be impacting your website's functionality. Disable Plugins and Themes: Temporarily deactivate plugins and switch to a default WordPress theme (e.g., Twenty Twenty-One) to determine if any conflicts exist. If the issue disappears after deactivating a specific plugin or theme, it indicates that the deactivated component may be causing the problem. You can then troubleshoot that plugin or theme to find a resolution. Check PHP Error Logs: If your website is hosted on a server, you can access the PHP error logs to identify any server-level errors. The location of the error logs varies depending on the hosting environment. Contact your hosting provider or consult their documentation to find the location of PHP error logs. Utilize WordPress Debugging Plugins: There are several debugging plugins available in the WordPress plugin repository that can assist in identifying and resolving issues. Plugins like \\"Query Monitor,\\" \\"Debug Bar,\\" or \\"Log Deprecated Notices\\" provide detailed debugging information, query performance insights, deprecated function usage, and more. Seek Community Support: If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, seek support from the WordPress community. Visit the official WordPress support forums, or specialized WordPress forums, or reach out to the support channels provided by theme or plugin developers. Describe the problem in detail and provide relevant information, such as error messages or screenshots, to help others assist you effectively. Remember to take precautions when debugging your website.

So I'd say you have no chance of convincing conservatives to give up their 2nd Ammendment rights in exchange for empty government promises of security if they do. Conservatives DO NOT trust their security to law enforcement or the government or anyone else but themselves. We've seen too many instances where those who have regretted doing so."},{"instruction":"it okay for a single woman in her thirties to get her first kitten (and/or pet)?","output":"Yes, it is absolutely okay for a single woman in her thirties to get her first kitten or pet!

At present the Falcon series of launch systems is considered a completed system and not subject to further development.

Elon Musk has already made it very plain that the survival of SpaceX depends upon the success of the Starship, and anything that would divert effort from maturing this system will not be contemplated. A fully developed Starship will simply outclass any current launch system including the Falcon Heavy, so why waste resources on an evolutionary dead end?

The man was not perfect no one is but by the time that the foundations of this nation were laid we needed someone that everyone would look up to and that everyone would trust and that man was George Washington and I believe that was really the only choice they had. He did a wonderful job as president remember no one came before him he was the one that's set all all the precedent and I do believe that he was such a beloved leader that at the time he could have become king but he thought of his nation in his people first.

I spent a lot of time reflecting on what that meant, and how everything about my marriage had literally retaught me about love and what commitment was. I was learning that love is reliable. Love is trustworthy. Love is not sleepless nights, or pain, or more tears than smiles. I was learning that loving someone is a gift, one that you give and one that constantly gives back. Everything I thought I knew about love, he erased and redefined. I felt as comfortable with him as I did the day we met. People ask me how I knew the first night I met him that he was going to be my husband. People ask me how you could marry someone you never even kissed. They asked how you could marry someone you only spent three hours with. Go from meeting each other, and then having to spend almost a year over phone lines because countries separated you. They asked how hard it was to live with someone without ‚Äúknowing‚Äù them. It was easy. I knew him, I knew him because everything about him felt like home. Like where he was, I belonged. There was never a question or hesitation because seeing him after nine months of being apart felt like no time had passed. Sometimes you just know. It‚Äôs hard to explain it because even putting words to describe it makes it seem cheap, or ridiculous.

Is there a better (meaning cheaper but ergonomically excellent) chair to buy for my home office?","output":"Back in the dot-com era I was a coder and worked for a company that gave everyone an Aeron chair. It was the cool-hip thing to have. I worked there for 3.5 years and, when I left, I was most sad about leaving the chair behind (and a few friends) I‚Äôm 6‚Ä≤4‚Ä≥ and 300+ lbs. The best thing, IMHO, about the HM Aeron is the sizing. They have 3 different sizes (A, B and C) that vary by frame size (small, med, large width on the seat and short, med, tall on the back) and by spring weighting. HM has a grid to help you figure out what might be best for you based on height/weight, but you really need to put your butt in a seat to know. Helpful tip‚Ä¶ to know what size you are sitting in, put your hand under the top of the chair (between the frame and the seat-back fabric) and feel for the little dots‚Ä¶ 1dots=A, 2dots=B, 3dots=C). My wife fits the chart for a B size chair and an A size based on her height, but prefers the extra wiggle room on my big C chair. The sizing makes it a bit of a PITA to purchase as you need to find a place w/ all of the sizes to try ‚Äôem on, but for the big guy like me, I finally feel like I‚Äôve got a chair made for my weight and I‚Äôm not sitting on some bit of flimsy plastic that was designed for an 80lb short woman. It also makes it tough if your company buys these for the entire office as I‚Äôd sometimes come back to my desk to find that someone had stolen my C in the middle of the night and left a B in its place (luckily I had marked my chair in a subtle way that was easy for me to spot and the thieves were probably surprised to find their B returned to them when they came back from lunch or a meeting the next day) I sucked it up and purchased a new Aeron chair for my home office. I sit there 8‚Äì10 hours per day, so whatever makes that time more comfortable is well worth it to me. I bought a fully customized exec model (chromed base, leather arms, all adjustments and the new lumbar support) about 7 years ago and love it. It still looks and feels like new (despite 8‚Äì10 hours of use per day with my fat ass in it). I‚Äôm here because we decided to get one for my wife and I‚Äôm searching Google for a new source. With COVID and working-from-home for her, she needs a decent chair too. The best analogy I‚Äôve got for you: An Aeron chair is the Rolls Royce of office chairs. They are expensive, tailored to you, very comfortable, very-solid, fully customizable and beautifully made. If those things matter to you and you have the cash, go for it. Does it hold you in a seated position just like a 2 folding chair from a garage sale down the street? Yes‚Ä¶ yes it does, but the experience is completely different."},{"instruction":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","output":"What‚Äôs a Proxy Server? A [LINKED_TEXT: proxy server ] [URL: https://proxyaz.com/]acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It‚Äôs an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse. Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy. If you‚Äôre using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you. If that‚Äôs all it does, why bother with a proxy server? Why not just go straight from to the website and back? Modern proxy servers do much more than forwarding web requests, all in the name of data security and network performance. Proxy servers act as a firewall and web filter, provide shared network connections, and cache data to speed up common requests. A good proxy server keeps users and the internal network protected from the bad stuff that lives out in the wild internet. Lastly, proxy servers can provide a high level of privacy. Types of Proxy Servers Not all proxy servers work the same way. It‚Äôs important to understand exactly what functionality you‚Äôre getting from the proxy server, and ensure that the proxy server meets your use case. Transparent Proxy A transparent proxy tells websites that it is a proxy server and it will still pass along your IP address, identifying you to the web server. Businesses, public libraries, and schools often use transparent proxies for content filtering: they‚Äôre easy to set up both client and server side. Anonymous Proxy An anonymous proxy will identify itself as a proxy, but it won‚Äôt pass your IP address to the website ‚Äì this helps prevent identity theft and keep your browsing habits private. They can also prevent a website from serving you targeted marketing content based on your location. For example, if [LINKED_TEXT: CNN - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos] [URL: http://cnn.com/] knows you live in Raleigh, NC, they will show you news stories they feel are relevant to Raleigh, NC. Browsing anonymously will prevent a website from using some ad targeting techniques, but is not a 100% guarantee. Distorting proxy A distorting proxy server passes along a false IP address for you while identifying itself as a proxy. This serves similar purposes as the anonymous proxy, but by passing a false IP address, you can appear to be from a different location to get around content restrictions. High Anonymity proxy High Anonymity proxy servers periodically change the IP address they present to the web server, making it very difficult to keep track of what traffic belongs to who. High anonymity proxies, like the [LINKED_TEXT: TOR Network] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)], is the most private and secure way to read the internet.

The most obvious distinction is their appearance. Granite and marble are both types of mineral stone, but the two are very different. Granite is slightly harder than marble, which means that it is more durable. Granite with visible crystalline grain has a duller surface finish which can be polished to a high gloss. Marble has a smoother surface and is softer than granite. The main difference between marble and granite is that marble is made up of the recrystallized minerals of skeletal fragments such as calcite and aragonite, while granite is caused by a heating and cooling of molten magma under great pressure. Granite is best for heavy traffic, where as marble is good for heavy use in bathroom, where you can see that it will be wet. So you have to choose granite or Marmo depending on your purpose. Granite is a copyrighted name; like Rolls Royce, which are all similar types of cars but they have different names. Marble is an actual rock which is made of either calcite or dolomite.

An explosion that would affect a part of the area. But negligible amount of damage. Ways in which earth would be destroyed Destruction by itself : Needs about 6 septillion kg of mass due to strong gravity. The energy needed to break it into chunks is equal to 40 million year energy received from the sun.Bombs : Soviet‚Äôs bombs gave 50 megatons of energy shifting over everything by 20 miles in any direction. We would need 1 quadrillion such bombs to break the earth into chunks.Asteroids : Dinosaur killer asteroid was equivalent to one million tzar bombs i.e. only one billionth of the energy needed to destroy the earth completely to the core.Collision with mars : If everything lines up just right i.e. after 4 billion years according to a simulation, earth and mars could actually collide.By the sun : In about 5 billion years the sun will begin its transition into a red giant. The growing sun would develop a stronger solar wind which would spray the planets away. In this process the sun would lose a lot of mass thus leading to reduction of its gravitational force which would increase the size of the earth‚Äôs orbit.

Grains And Beans A number of grains and beans are ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô proteins but you have to eat them in proper combinations.They are good for sedentary people with a lower requirement of daily protein but are inadequate for you. Legumes One cup of boiled lentils contains about 18 g protein on an average. You can turn to kidney beans or ‚Äòrajma‚Äô for a protein boost though. Soybeans Soybeans are one of the richest plant-based protein sources. You‚Äôll get more than 28.5 g of protein from 1 cup of boiled soybeans. Dairy A cup of low- fat milk provides 8 g protein and 5-10 g of fat. The protein in milk called casein makes up roughly 80 percent of the protein found in all dairy products. And it is a good protein as it is a slow-digesting because it forms ‚Äúclumps‚Äù in the stomach that take 5-7 hours to digest.

In banking language, Third Party Transfer is called a credit-push system, which means transactions can be originated only to remit funds to a beneficiary. Transactions covered under Third Party Transfers NEFT [LINKED_TEXT: National Electronic Fund Transfer] [URL: https://razorpay.com/learn/neft-characteristics-key-points/], launched in 2005, maintained by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is a mode that helps bank customers transfer funds between two NEFT-enabled bank accounts on a one-to-one basis. Interestingly, NEFT was lauded as the quickest method to transfer funds online until UPI came along in 2016. Consumers looking to [LINKED_TEXT: initiate NEFT transactions] [URL: https://razorpay.com/learn/transfer-funds-neft/] must do so within banking hours. Sometimes, these can vary from branch to branch. As a general rule, NEFT transactions occur between 9:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays, and 9:00 am to 1:00 pm on Saturdays. RTGS [LINKED_TEXT: Real Time Gross Settlement] [URL: https://razorpay.com/learn/features-of-rtgs/] is primarily designed for large fund transfers. Unlike NEFT, the payment transaction is not subject to a waiting period. It is settled as soon as they are processed because RBI monitors the transfer, and the payment is considered as final and irrevocable. In order to use RTGS, the sender and receiver‚Äôs banks need to be RTGS enabled. It is crucial to keep in mind that RTGS payments are linked with banking hours. Customers can only make this form of payment between 9:00 am ‚Äì 4:00 pm on weekdays, and 9:00 am ‚Äì 2:00 pm on Saturdays.

Is this borderline high?","output":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 falls in the category of \\"elevated\\" according to the American Heart Association (AHA). The AHA defines elevated blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure reading (the first number) between 120-129 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure reading (the second number) less than 80 mm Hg. A pulse rate of 52 falls within the normal range of 60-100 beats per minute for adults, so it is not a cause for concern on its own. It's important to note that a single blood pressure reading is not enough to make a diagnosis of high blood pressure (hypertension). Blood pressure can vary throughout the day and can be influenced by factors such as stress, physical activity, and medications. If you are concerned about your blood pressure, it's a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider. They may recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home or in their office, and making lifestyle changes such as increasing physical activity, reducing sodium intake, and quitting smoking.

Depending on how the string is plucked and how much tension is in the string, different musical notes will be created by the string. These musical notes could be said to be excitation modes of that guitar string under tension. In a similar manner, in string theory, the elementary particles we observe in particle accelerators could be thought of as the \\"musical notes\\" or excitation modes of elementary strings. In string theory, as in guitar playing, the string must be stretched under tension in order to become excited. However, the strings in string theory are floating in spacetime, they aren't tied down to a guitar. Nonetheless, they have tension. The string tension in string theory is denoted by the quantity 1/(2 p a'), where a' is pronounced \\"alpha prime\\"and is equal to the square of the string length scale. If string theory is to be a theory of quantum gravity, then the average size of a string should be somewhere near the length scale of quantum gravity, called the Planck length, which is about 10-33 centimeters, or about a millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a centimeter. Unfortunately, this means that strings are way too small to see by current or expected particle physics technology (or financing!!) and so string theorists must devise more clever methods to test the theory than just looking for little strings in particle experiments. String theories are classified according to whether or not the strings are required to be closed loops, and whether or not the particle spectrum includes fermions. In order to include fermions in string theory, there must be a special kind of symmetry calledsupersymmetry, which means for every boson (particle that transmits a force) there is a corresponding fermion (particle that makes up matter). So supersymmetry relates the particles that transmit forces to the particles that make up matter. Supersymmetric partners to to currently known particles have not been observed in particle experiments, but theorists believe this is because supersymmetric particles are too massive to be detected at current accelerators. Particle accelerators could be on the verge of finding evidence for high energy supersymmetry in the next decade. Evidence for supersymmetry at high energy would be compelling evidence that string theory was a good mathematical model for Nature at the smallest distance scales."},{"instruction":"What do you see when you look at the GOP?","output":"Non deviants"},{"instruction":"My 18yearold son is on the rental lease with me.

That form of legal education was commonplace in Lincoln's day and a large percentage of attorneys learned their trade by apprenticing and reading the law rather than by attending law school. Today, only four states still allow the process: California, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. However a lawyer that has passed the Bar and been admitted to practice in one of those states can apply for admission in sister states under the rules of reciprocity and constitutional full faith and credit, although they may have to take and pass the sister state‚Äôs Bar exam to be licensed to practice therein on more than a pro hac vice status."},{"instruction":"Mario Draghi said, Work done today can continue regardless of who will be the Italian premier tomorrow.

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"This is an issue ‚Äî States/Localities enforcing Federal laws ‚Äî that has come up before, most notably in the area of immigration. So far, the courts have largely held that it is up to the Federal government to enforce federal law‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt make the States do it for them. While State and local authorities do often cooperate with the Feds, that cooperation is almost never required, rather, it is voluntary. This made the news a few years ago, with the specific issue of Immigration Detainers. An Immigration Detainer is essentially a request to hold a person previously detained for another crime, for up to 48 hours after he would have been released. A few States had a problem with that and it made the news when the federal administration threatened retaliation. The threats went away when federal abuse of the program made the news, particularly when hundreds (possibly thousands) of suspected illegal immigrants held on detainers turned out to be US citizens. Personally, I have a big problem with States being required to enforce federal laws. Quite often, they aren‚Äôt trained or qualified to do so, and end up making the problem worse. The Missouri law‚Äôs wording probably wouldn‚Äôt stand up in court, but it‚Äôs kind of a moot point. As it stands now, a State can decline to enforce any federal law‚Ä¶ they can simply ignore it, and they don‚Äôt need to pass a law to do that. The law seems to be more of a political statement than anything else. The Feds are free to enforce federal law in any of the States, and if the State wishes to challenge that, they will have to do it court, not in the legislature. In the meantime, a word to the wise: If you choose to ignore federal law because your State says that federal law is invalid, the Feds can still come and get you."},{"instruction":"w much insulin should a healthy person produce per day?

Let me name a band I am surprised not mentioned. And a different version of a band mentioned a few times. The Who, The Lead Singer use ti be the Lead Guitar player, Roger Daltrey , He also would bully the group, this band often had fights on stage when they were working their way to a contract, not with the audience but themselves. The Band fired the singer, Roger put down his guitar and Pete Townshend became the sole Guitar player. Pete was physically and sexually molested as a boy by his family, grandmother and her boyfriends. Hence the story of Tommy, the album that really put them on the map. The Bass player John Entwistle was so shy he would hand way off to the side of the stage, which is a shame, his style of playing bass was very different as in many songs his Bass was dominant over the Guitar. And last but not least is the Drummer, Keith Moon, who had a addictive personality, alcohol, drugs, women, you name it. He loved to break up hotel rooms, in the 60‚Äôs on a tour of America, The Who, mostly Keith did so much damage to hotels, the band was bared for live from Holiday Inn. Once when they were heading out to their ride to the Airport, Keith yelled, stop the car, I forgot something and went back up to his room and tossed the TV out the window several floors up. Another time he drove a car into the Pool of a hotel2).

The Earth's temperature has been steadily increasing over the past century, leading to changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels, and other environmental impacts. Climate change is considered by many experts to be one of the most pressing global issues of our time, as it has the potential to cause significant and widespread disruptions to human society, natural ecosystems, and the planet's biogeochemical cycles. Many international organizations and governments have recognized the need to address climate change and have implemented policies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate its effects. It's important to note that there are still ongoing debates about the causes and consequences of climate change, as well as the most effective ways to address it. However, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is a major contributor to climate change and that immediate action is necessary to prevent its worst impacts.

ANSWER : As far as I know, Hindi language especially the policy to Hindi Imposition of the Union Government indeed triggers South Indians like me because it is like SHOUTING in my ears that I am a second class citizen of this country. This is unacceptable to me and I will vehemently oppose this policy of treating me as a second class citizen. I want all the languages listed in schedule VIII of the constitution to be treated equally and you cannot expect me to agree with the policy of the Union Government that gives special privilege to Hindi and simultaneously sideline my mother tongue. You respect my mother tongue and I respect your mother tongue. It is simple as that. To cite an example of the disappointment I have with the policy of Hindi Imposition. I would LOVE to get my Indian Passport printed in Malayalam and English (for foreign immigration authorities) rather than in Hindi and English. Reference Picture 1 : Sample format of the Indian passport issued to Malayalam speaking citizens of India, Image courtesy, Facebook My point is very simple Let Hindi speaking people have their Indian passport printed in Hindi and English and let me have my Indian passport printed in Malayalam and English.

Therefore, the usual excuse people make in saying Government of India cannot issue passports in any of the schedule VIII language and English according to the wishes of the passport applicant is baseless.

Addition: the strangest thing I personally have found was rather different. I was working at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh and my boss had sent me on an errand to the Neuroscience building. I took a wrong turning and found myself in an upstairs corridor I'd never seen before. Sticking out of the wall at an angle halfway along was a thing like a 10ft-wide dustbin-lid covered with dials and levers, and which I assume was the back-end of an MRI or CT scanner. What was really strange was that right in the middle, somebody had chained a bicycle to one of the levers. Every time I went to that building thereafter, for years, I tried to find that corridor again - but I never could. Something else which I found at the hospital, which wasn't strange in itself but had what I thought very amusing consequences, was a floppy disc full of patient data which I found on the bus. It wasn't a very serious breach of confidentiality because tha patients were identified only by numbers. not names. but it was still a careless act. I sent out an email on the hospital system, looking for the owner. Later that day my boss - who was one of the most senior managers in the hospital, very young and a wee bit pompous - called me in to his office and told me that when I found the owner I was to report them to him. as there would have to be serious consequences for such a major breach of hospital data-protection rules. Oh, I said, I've already found the owner. He bridled like a turkey cock, as the saying goes, and demanded to know who it was - but when I told him the name he deflated like a pricked balloon, because the person who had left the disc on the bus was a God-calls-me-God senior oncology consultant before whom mere managers were expected to say yes sir, no sir and pull their forelocks."},{"instruction":"What is the proper swordsman‚Äôs stance with a sword during combat and how do you do it?","output":"That depends on the kind of sword you are using and, to some extent, the school of swordsmanship you belong to. What all sword fighting stances have in common is being stable and balanced and optimized for both defense and attack. If you compare combat stances in schools if swordsmanship as widely separated as Japanese Kenjutsu and German longsword fencing, you will notice a lot of parallels but also certain differences. Body mechanics and the practical necessities of being able to move quickly and decisively to attack and defend, more or less ensure that certain principles of swordsmanship become universal. Nonetheless, there are important differences dictated by the kind of sword. If you are fighting with a two-handed sword, like a longsword or katana, you will need to stand in a more centered, squared-off stance than if you are fighting with a one-handed sword, which may encourage a more side-on stance given that you want to both reduce the size of the target presented by your body and extend the reach of hour sword arm as much as possible. If you have a shield or companion weapon, your stance will change again to maximize the opportunities presented by your extra weapon (and a shield is also a weapon). Another important factor is what your sword is intended for. Are you fighting in armour or unarmoured? Is your sword a cutter, a thruster or a cut and thrust sword? If you have a thrust-centric sword like a smallsword (most of which had no cutting edge at all and were basically just skewers) there is no point adopting cutting stances. If you have a flat-bladed falchion that can only cut but not thrust, there is no point adopting a thrusting stance. If you have a sword that can do both, you adopt a stance to maximize your options. If you wish to learn how to swordfight, there is nothing better than practicing the art for real. modern sport fencing will teach you the essential stances for duelling with the smallsword, √©p√©e or saber. Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) can teach you pretty much every kind of European-style combat from the Medieval period to 19th Century military saber fencing. Kendo, iaido and Kenjutsu can teach you Japanese sword arts and some schools of kungfu still teach Chinese swordsmanship. Philipino Martial Arts such as Eskrima/Kali will teach you the Philipino way of armed combat. There is no one way to use a sword but if you compare styles, you will notice significant commonalities and parallels between all of them. This is to be expected as there are only so many ways to use the human body in combat and the most effective styles are those that survive."},{"instruction":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","output":"This depends on your skill level, time availability, and what repairs are required.

The current system is extremely bad. Nobody except the politicians are benifitting off the system. 25 years ago, people barely knew anyone who had to go foreign land to find work. There were lot of factories, especially garment and carpet factories that provided tons of jobs to a lot of people. OECD has a brilliant piece on it.

After the end of monarchy this industry was deliberately sabotaged in the name of communism by imposing high taxes and asking for unreasonable demands from the producers. Imagine you are a factory owner barely making a few lakhs profit a month, giving employment to 25 employees, and the Maoist government tells you that you need to pay each of your employees 1 lakh per month and 1 month paid holiday. Wouldn't you just move to China or Bangladesh and open a factory there? That's what happened in Nepal, too much ridiculous demands from the communists forced the capitalists to move to new countries, Wai Wai currently produces it's noodles in India, similarly many other factories relocated. Because of this nowdays it's hard to find a family which doesn't have a few sons working in foreign countries, there's literally no jobs. If you are an educated individual, you go to US, Australia, etc after becoming 18, if you are uneducated you go to Dubai, Qatar. This phenomenon was unheard of during monarchy.Corruption. I don't even need to say anything on this. There are tons and tons of research which shows that Nepal has become the most corrupt country in Asia. Just to give you a practical example, Gokul Baskota who was known to have taken 70 crore in bribes isn't in jail, he's currently living in Prime Minister's house. People are having this feeling that it's better to have one corrupt king than 600 corrupt politicians.Big bureaucracy: Current 90% of the Nepal government's budget is recurring expenses, which means that 90% of our tax money goes into paying the existing government employees. There are so many karyalaya and mantralaya now that it's hard to keep track. Only 10% is going to your betterment, and even among that most of it is lost in corruption. The only infrastructure being built in Nepal are currently being built by India, China, Japan, USA etc.National Unity: People are social creatures, we are hiveminds, that's just a natural fact. We interconnect with other people if we resonate and have the same story to tell. Under monarch, the story was that our nation was united by a poor but a fireceful king called P.N. Shah to protect us from Mughals and British, and this gave legitimacy to our existence as a nation. But after the end of monarchy, this legitimacy was lost, and different ethnic groups have started going their own way. Some are demanding Limbuwan, some are demanding a Madesh country, some are demanding Newar Rajya etc. National unity is being compromised, organisation which used to be illegal for trying to break the nation during monarchy are running freely like MNO, C.K. Raut etc. If we don't have a uniting force, we will break apart, that's just geopolitics.Foreign interference: King's legitimacy depends upon his country, if the country doesn't exist king will not exist either. So it's in king's interest to not compromise with foreign powers, especially in regards to national sovereignty. But politicians will happily sell the country to India or China if they promise a high ranking post for them in future. And currently that's what is happening, both China and India are trying to buy as much politicians as they can to legitimise support.Popular support: The support of removal of monarchy was never there outside of Maoist circle, even non-Maoist communists like Madan Bhandari or even K.P. Oli were supportive of monarchy, but then monarchy was hastily removed without any public approval. Many people are angry about that. Monarchy and Hindu rashtra were never a thorn in Nepali society, Nepali monarchs were never as ruthless as say Tsars in Russia, and there wasn't much hatred for the institution of monarchy as people associated monarchy with national unity. But then without any public support, without any referendum monarchy and Hindu rashtra were removed overnight. The support so far didn't boil to what it is now because people had hoped that now that politicians cannot blame monarchy for their inefficiency, they'll do a good job, but no, instead the new Prime Ministers started acting more pampered than monarchy.Education level and humbleness: Monarchs are generally well educated in reputed organisation. Birendra was educated in Harvard and Gyanendra in TU. Compare this to current politicians it's hard to even find a 10th class pass politician, current PM is 8th class fail. How can we expect such people to understand complex stuff like economics and geopolitics? Also monarchs in my experience are more humble. For example when Gyanendra visited Myagdi, he talked with people and walked with people during heavy rain even though Maoists had threatened to kill him. He had to cancel his later visits to religious sites because of the threat of assassination but when was the last time you saw Oli or Prachande walk among people? They just stay in their mansions in Kathmandu and disrupt the traffic now and then. All in all monarchy is better than whatever shitshow we have right now. But it's hard to say whether monarchy can return or not, mainly because the the political parties in power hate monarchy."},{"instruction":"w were video games from the 90s made?

While some studies have indicated that microwaving can make food lose some of its nutritional value, others have discovered that it has little to no impact on nutrient levels. When food is cooked in a microwave oven, various structural and processing changes can occur. When foods are cooked at high temperatures, dangerous chemicals, such as acrylamide in starchy meals, can arise as a result. It's crucial to remember that using a range of cooking techniques and paying attention to the temperature at which you are cooking your food are the keys to healthy cooking. Use microwave-safe containers as well as stay away from plastic containers that can contain dangerous substances like BPA, which can leach into food when heated. If you have certain health issues or dietary limitations, it is always advised that you speak with a doctor or dietician.

Glass bowls are oven-safe and can be used for baking cakes, as long as they are made of tempered glass that is designed to withstand high temperatures. When baking a cake in a glass bowl, there are a few important points to keep in mind: Choose the Right Bowl: Make sure the glass bowl you're using is oven-safe and made of tempered glass. Avoid using thin glass or glass bowls that are not explicitly labeled as oven-safe.Prep the Bowl: Grease the inside of the glass bowl with butter or cooking spray to prevent the cake from sticking.Adjust Baking Time: Glass conducts heat differently than metal pans, so the baking time might need to be adjusted. Glass retains heat for longer, so the cake may take a little longer to bake. Start checking for doneness around the original recommended baking time, and then continue to check every few minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Temperature: You can generally use the same temperature as mentioned in the cake recipe, but if you're concerned about the glass bowl's heat retention, you could consider reducing the temperature slightly (by about 25¬∞F or 15¬∞C).Avoid Extreme Temperature Changes: Don't place the glass bowl directly from the refrigerator into a hot oven, as sudden temperature changes could cause the glass to crack. Allow the bowl to come to room temperature before placing it in the preheated oven.Monitor the Cake: Keep an eye on the cake as it bakes to prevent over-browning. If you notice that the cake is browning too quickly on top, you can loosely cover it with aluminum foil. Remember that while glass bowls are suitable for baking cakes, they might result in a slightly different texture compared to traditional cake pans. It's a good idea to do a trial run and keep an eye on the cake to ensure it bakes evenly and doesn't overcook.

Technically, it has little to do with the power of the Shinobi, as with other ranks in general, but the recurring theme of the strongest Shinobi being the Kage has made it into a fandom based power level metric. But we do have an official power-ranking system as well. D - C - B - A - S D being the weakest threat level irrespective of the rank. S being the highest threat level irrespective of the rank. (But with the K11, almost all of the established systems were distorted one way or another) . . . Akatsuki is the organization comprising of only S-ranked individuals. All Kage from Naruto to Chojuro are at least S-ranked Shinobi, so Akatsuki can informally be compared to some of the Kage, but not all. Jonin are quite varied in overall power, ranging from low A-rank to S-rank. So, there are Jonin comparable to Akatsuki, but then there are some who are not even close."},{"instruction":"it unethical to tell an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient that they‚Äôre vacationing in an awesome place, rather than telling them they‚Äôre in a care facility‚Äîassuming they would take your word for it, feel happy, and not discover the lie?","output":"It is not a good idea.

Possibly but only if he had countless tries Watch the film Star Trek from 2009 In both the prime and the Kelvin timeline James Kirk altered the test in Starfleet making it possible for him to rescue the ship In Star Trek Video Game Starfleet Academy( not Canon) they mention some possibilities (on how to cheat) Normally the test is designed to be unwinnable.. it's in test of character. It's a test of what would you do during a no win situation. However even an unwinnable test is not 100% foolproof. The person who programmed the test of the simulation usually tries to think of nearly everything but unfortunately they can't all the time. There might be a way to beat it but it's very rare and it may take many tries to do that. Normally they don't let you keep trying. But Kirk got three chances in the Kelvin timeline Is the Kobayashi Maru test winnable even if you don't cheat? Apparently it is! Watch the first season of Star Trek Prodigy.(Highly Recommend Prodigy BTW. despite being a kids show it has many adult themes.and its very entertaining and in line with Trek canon. wayyyy better than the crapfest Discovery Probably the best Trek series since DS9) in the 1x6 episode, The main character Dal takes the test over and over and actually finds a way to beat it ( and would have won if he wasn't so careless and not put his feet on the console causing a torpedo to destroy his original ship) And this is considered Canon in Star Trek that means that whoever programmed it did did not think of everything.. but that's just lazy programming. if someone really wanted to do their due diligence and think of nearly everything making it almost impossible for the average person to come up with a solution it would take them a long time to program it . So to answer your question, yes If Data had the same amount of tries he probably would have also won. But we have no idea how many times Dal tried. And I don't think that Starfleet would have let a person take it 200 times just to find a weakness in the programming. Here is a video from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ,where we are introduced to the test. The Original Kobayashi Maru test was vs Klingons The upgraded version was against Romulans( as at the time the Klingons were/are allies and had a treaty and there was NO more Klingon Neutral Zone following the Khitomer Accords Heres how it works, The crew during the simulation recieve a distress call from the ship Kobayashi Maru. it is in the neutral zone entering it would violate the Treaty with the Klingons.. therein lies the conundrum. Typically during the first or 2nd try there is only so many ways to solve this: Do you ignore it? honoring the treaty? even if it means the death of innocents?Do you attempt a rescue? If either side enters and is detected, this constitutes an act of war. IF you try, several Klingon ships( or Romulans in the newer version) decloak & attack you. In comparison to the firepower of your ship, you are hopelessly outmanned and outgunned .Even if you are able to destroy 1, or 2 ‚Ä¶or ALL ships by some miracle. several more enemy vessels quickly show up . Now you are once again outnumbered, but now your ship is severely damagedDo you try to escape if you see yourself outnumbered and dont want to appear like Starfleet just violated the treaty?No good, as you may find yourself without warp drive, OR they may catch up to you and kill you WHILE you are escaping at warp So as you can see, you have little options at first. Dal won only because he had countless tries and found a flaw in whoever programmed the test. But it might have been luck more than anything. The person who programmed the Kobayashi Maru test is an imperfect being. Since the being is not perfect,that means there's always a possibility that would only mean that the programming was flawed. But Data and Dal are also imperfect and it would take them many tries to eventually figure it out. But I think the point is you're not supposed to keep trying. As I said it is a test of character because when you're around in space you might come across a situation that you just cannot win. So what do you do? Do you destroy yourself to prevent an enemy from capturing your ship? Do you go down fighting? Do you try to escape? Do you not bother risking your ship???? That's what the test is about. Its a psychological test Think of it as like a Rorschach test. It's supposed to have Starfleet know what kind of person you are. Are you aggressive? Are you careful? Are you cunning? Are you too by the book? That would go in your Starfleet file and that's why the test is so important.. Any future commander would read this for any of your future postings. Watch the TNG episode Tapestry to understand why the Kobayashi Maru test is used Originally ,Picard was bold because he had a near death experience. but in an alternate timeline he had no such experience so he lived life very cautious and never rose to command duties, He was at most a worker bee. if i had to guess, this version of Picard probably didnt risk his ship in the Starfleet test. Thats not to say that everyone in command is reckless. Just sometimes take risks and stand out. be a leader. Kirk did not believe in a no win scenario and while there are always options ( as Worf once said) that doesn't necessarily mean that those options can end up having you victorious in the end. Kirk was just lucky in his entire career that he never ran into a truly unwinnable situation. But there is always no win scenarios.. For example, in Star Trek Into Darkness Kirk would have been killed if it wasn't for Scotty sabotaging the Vengeance. That was a no win scenario The enemy ship had more powerful weapons, it was faster and just more advanced in every way. You couldn't run or hide from it. And it was clearly far more rugged as it was able to survive Photon torpedo explosions inside and still remain intact. They all should have been killed. The only reason why they didn't is because of plot armor.. sheer Luck. UPDATE However. the only reason why Dal beat the test was . according to the ep, beamed on board the Klingon ship and then disabled or killed the crew. But the BOP would have shields up so this is a major plot hole as it would prevent Dal from transporting to their ship during battle So this may be Lazy writing in Prodigy to prove you can beat the Kobayashi Maru Test after all!.

I also agree it would have to depend on your weight gain pattern. In my case, I grew up obese. I had never been thin so I had no point of comparison. I weighed 150 lbs when I was 9 years old. At the time, no one else in my family was fat. I have to say something controversial -keep in mind I do not imply this applies to all obese people just some of them. As an obese person, you can be obsessed with your weight to a narcissistic extent. When you walk into a room, your first thought is \\"everyone thinks I'm fat, they're looking at how fat I am\\". That is your relationship to the world. You think you're not popular, loveable, successful or whatever because you are fat. I'd never really tried to go on a diet. With my self esteem in the toilet, I thought it was a wasted exercise, I could never be successful at it and I had no future. At the time I was a high school drop out who shoveled sewers in a food factory. I lived with my cat in a tiny travel trailer. By my 18th birthday (June) I was suicidal and thought I would kill myself as a new year's resolution. In August, it struck me I could just try a diet and maybe save myself. I did everything you're supposed to do, really. I never cheated once. At the end of six months I weighed myself. I'd only lost 20 lbs. You might think it depressed me but I was PISSED, outraged! All that sacrifice for a crappy 20 lbs?! So, I sold my car and bought a bike. The weight came off faster then. I ended up losing 150 lbs over three years. It changed my whole life. [The only advice I can give to anyone trying to lose weight is to know it was harder and took much longer to lose the last 30 lbs than it was to lose the first 120. I think I would have gained weight back if I hadn't lost the last 30 which reset my body metabolism.] After the weight loss, I went to visit my parents who picked me up at the airport. They didn't recognize me even when I stood in front of them and spoke to them, they heard my voice but looked right past or around me, looking for me. It didn't make me feel good, I started crying right there in the airport. Didn't they love *me*? Wouldn't they know me anywhere, anyhow? But they did not. Anyway, I suddenly had a future -and shockingly enough, a lingerie model figure (36-24-36). Hell, if I'd known I was going to look like that, I would have tried dieting while I was still in junior high! It was bizarre, I could do and be anything -maybe. I signed up for classes at the community college even though I was so afraid I was too stupid to handle the course load. I admit fear ran me (weight can do that to your head) but I made the dean's list every semester. I later transferred to an excellent school and took more rigorous coursework, ending up with three majors. Most semesters I took over 21 credit hours with a near perfect 4.0 (I've had one B in my college career). But back to the narcissism thing, weight plays head games with you. Once I was thin and the shoe was on the other foot, I *knew* that weight wasn't the first thing I noticed about someone but I would feel sorry for some fat people because I knew that was what they thought and there was no telling them any different. It was only when I was thin that I could see fat people could be happy, loved, successful - and wonderful in spite of their weight. I had to face the fact that people didn't like me because I was an a - a whole other story. Cleaning up my head with therapy sessions took YEARS. I do want to say another thing. Notice I have never said \\"if I could do it, you could do it\\" because it's not true. Saying that deprecates everyone's experience, that what I did is so trivial that anyone could do it if they only had a little perseverance and discipline, that being overweight is a character issue. That is crap. Obese people know all about perseverance, otherwise they'd never get out of bed in the morning. Post script: I'm still obsessed with weight albeit not my own. I'm an internationally recognized authority in clothing sizes."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"Here is a really simple one and how it played out for me.

ŒàŒΩŒΩŒµœÄŒµ = œÄŒµœÇ ŒºŒøŒπ = ŒºŒøœÖ ŒúŒøœçœÉŒ± = ŒúŒøœçœÉŒ± œÄŒøŒªœçœÑœÅŒøœÄŒøŒΩ = (œÑŒøŒΩ) œÄŒøŒªœÖŒºŒÆœáŒ±ŒΩŒø. It‚Äôs practically the same. Even if you left œÄŒøŒªœçœÑœÅŒøœÄŒøŒΩ as it is and not use the commonly used œÄŒøŒªœÖŒºŒÆœáŒ±ŒΩŒø instead, people would get the gist. Most Greeks would be able to tell easily what this phrase means. Does that mean Homer is easy? Hell no. I can‚Äôt understand most of Homer, even though I studied both the Iliad and the Odyssey before in the original in high school. It‚Äôs too hard. The grammar is hard, the syntax is hard, many words are unknown to me in their archaic form. I can understand maybe 15% or 20% of it and that‚Äôs by putting in quite some effort. It‚Äôs not unintelligible either though. If I had to compare it with something in English, it wouldn‚Äôt be Beowulf level of difficulty, but it wouldn‚Äôt be Shakespeare level of easy either (that would be Hellenistic Greek). It‚Äôs somewhere in between. Homer is the earliest form of Greek literature we have. Before that we only have inscriptions in Linear B, before the invention of the alphabet. I can‚Äôt read Linear B, so that‚Äôs how far back you have to go for Ancient Greek to be completely unintelligible to me."},{"instruction":"Which is the best theme restaurant in Bangalore?","output":"Android Download Link: [LINKED_TEXT: Udeels - Nearby deals & offers - Android Apps on Google Play] [URL: http://udeels.com/dw?a=1623dc88] iOS Download Link: [LINKED_TEXT: Udeels | Find Nearby Deals & Offers on the App Store] [URL: http://udeels.com/dw?i=1623dc88]"},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"First off - Vedic Rudra is the directly related to the present \\"Puranic\\" Shiva. Vedic Vishnu is directly related to the present Vishnu. The Goddesses Saraswati, Ushas, Ratri and Vac are directly related to the present Devi. But to the larger point - Our Dharma evolves. Indra is constantly praised in the Rg Veda, but he is barely worshipped at all anymore. The same goes with many of the Vedic deities - Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Ushas, Vayu, Yama... I could go on. One way to look at things is that our ancient ancestors worshipped elemental forces - rain, wind, sun and river - because that is what they needed to survive at that level of civilization. As our human civilization evolves, so did our dharma, and deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi slowly co-opted and replaced earlier devotions. In my opinion this is a greatness of our dharma compared to the Abrahamic faiths. We have many books, many gods, many ways of looking at the world, and they adapt and evolve throughout time without loosing their essential core. The Abrahamic faiths have one book, one prophet, one \\"God\\" and are unable to change and adapt as humanity evolves."},{"instruction":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?","output":"What are the differences between those who succeed slowly and those who succeed fast?

George just couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep after the annoying sex he had moments ago with his wife, Mitchell. He instead went to the living room, made a drink for himself and switched on the TV. Any husband would be upset to learn that his wife is in love with someone else. He was suspicious of her acts but never in his wildest of dreams he had thought that situation could be this much worse. His annoyance crossed the threshold when he saw the man responsible for everything on one of the channels. He switched multiple channels but still couldn‚Äôt escape Adam Smith‚Äôs flawless face and charming smile, that‚Äôs exactly how his wife would describe him. It was his birthday and the same being featured on every channel. George made another drink for himself. The bastard had kissed Mitchell more often than her own husband. She would even strip off her clothes to feast his eyes with her curves in George‚Äôs absence. Although George had known all this he would stay quiet for he wanted his wife herself to confess everything about her lover, but that never happened. ‚ÄúAdam turns forty tonight‚Äù, she had said which immediately pissed off her husband. He felt as if Smith‚Äôs birthday pleased his wife even more than sex and thus had walked out of the bedroom. Adam Smith‚Äôs smile appeared to mock George from within the TV. He had lost his head as he grabbed the knife from the fruit basket placed on the dining table. Had Adam been there in front of him, George would have slaughtered him on his birthday. But since it was his wife who seemed more excited about everything, she deserved the lesson to be taught first. After all she had chosen her lover over her husband. He got up from his chair and walked towards his bedroom. His wife lay naked in the blanket on the bed. He sneaked towards her side of the bed with the knife in his hand. There was just enough light for him to see her face. He wondered whether he should do it and thought hard to find any reason which would prevent the same. He couldn‚Äôt find one. He then cautiously started to scratch the knife on the wall beside her wife.

Standard wisdom is that 80-90% of the funds will come from 10-20% of the donors. It is also pretty standard that a project this large has arisen out of a thoughtful strategic planning process. This is not bake sale territory but you do want the campaign to become accessible to everyone once it is known to be a success. When you have commitments for the bulk of the needed funds you can open up the campaign to the community to encourage everyone's involvement, and do something like sell square feet of the gym for 10 each.

Firstly I am adopted. My Mom never told me about sex or menstruation but had the decency to ask a trusted teacher to do it. This was before sex ed in schools. The reason she did that was as she told me here and I will repeat it. My mother was born in 1926 and has passed away so I think she won‚Äôt mind. I started asking her about the changes going on with my body. Some girls in my class already were wearing bras and some had started their periods. My mother told me she couldn‚Äôt talk to me about it. She said it was because she started when she was 16. She had no idea what was happening and thought she was dying of cancer or a blood disorder or something. When she tried to talk to my grandmother, my grandmother tossed a bra at her and told her to start wearing it so that she didn‚Äôt look like a loose woman. My grandmother also told her only bad women had sex and that she didn‚Äôt want to hear anything about this again and that my mother was to never shame her family by talking about this anymore. My poor mother finally moved off the farm when she was 19 to work in the big City. She secretly went to a Doctor to ask about her monthly bleeding. He actually laughed at her and called her stupid before explaining to her what was going on. This would have been around 1944. So sad really. She spent 3 years of her life thinking she was dying. How awful that must have been. Again, she felt she couldn‚Äôt talk to me about it so she had the smarts to have someone do it for her and the teacher handled it very well. On a side note, since my mother had never been pregnant in her life, she was totally unprepared for my pregnancies. Oh how she worried about very insignificant things. She was also superstitious so thought if I saw a bat the baby would have a birthmark, or if I didn‚Äôt sleep in the afternoon daily I would miscarry. I spent a lot of time reassuring her I was fine but that was hard too. Ignorance is not bliss. I get this was a different generation and time period but wow, still blows my mind since it really seems quite cruel. I often wonder if my grandmother even knew why she had 12 children of whom 7 survived.

There you will learn stuff that is reallllyyyyy helpful. Basic tactics, which are useful for even the max townhall levels. FOR TH10: QUEENCHARGES(queen +4/5 healers+ funneling (babe drags+wizards)): Q(ueen)c(harge) lalo (hound + loon +minions) qc hogs(hogrider +wizards) qc/qw miners(miners) qc Dragon(dragons+minions) although I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing queencharges unless queen is maxed and it‚Äôs very hard to master. queencharge vs queen walk: queencharge goes deep into the base to take out multiple key defenses. Queen walk breaks max two layers of walls and takes out some valuable stuff, some key defenses and walk along the base Other non queencharge/queenwalk tactics (you can still start your attack with a queenwalk/warden walk as a funnel for your main attack): PEKKABOBAT (4pekka+ some bowlers+ 4healers +wallwrecker min 5 bat spells rest freeze one rage) BAT SLAP (same as pekkabobat but with witches and no pekkas and bowlers) FROZEN WITCH (Army troop combination of bat slap but spells are 1/2 rages 1 heal rest freeze one poision pls) DRAGBAT (Dragons loons bats freeze rage) REMINDER: this is for competitive wars.

Like, to like someone and blush hopelessly hardly happened to me except for 1‚Äì2 situations. But then, I did had a crush on someone while I was in 2nd year MBBS. There was this senior of mine who was interning. And while we went into the wards for clinics, no one actually paid heed to us as we had just entered 2nd year. This was somewhere in November. This senior of ours, who was also known as Harrison since he had read the Bible of medicine, HARRISON. Amidst all this, he made sure to teach us something everyday. He used to teach us for for an hour almost daily amidst work. And that too with a strong eye contact. Out of my liking for medicine, I got a crush on him. But as a person, he was very shy and reserved. I don't remember exactly how we bonded (probably, Facebook). Then, after a long time, we exchanged our numbers. We hardly talked. But then, his internship was about to get complete in month of March and we were the organising batch that year. He was from a different state. I knew we would never meet again once he left. So once I had told him that you need to give me a treat before leaving. You're done with this 5.5 years course. This I had told in December. I don't know how he remembered it. We had no contacts over these months. Our postings changed. He went on in some other department as an intern and I was posted somewhere else. But before leaving, he texted me, he asked me that where should we meet as promised. And no matter how much I wanted to meet him, I was surprised and cold. I didn't know how to react. I was like I can't meet him. I'm scared. But ultimately, we met for an ice-cream and spent around an hour together. I was speechless because I was lost. Normally, I talk a lot. And then after having that meeting, he left me near my hostel on his bike. So yeah!! it was a moment with my crush.

Why make a non issue an issue? How will celebrating Eid/ ramdan with army going to improve the secular credentials of the prime minister of India? We need to be more liberal in our thinking. History has been replete with incidents of religious harmony between various faiths in India and fearful riots over small things over small issues. Army is the most secular organisation that India has where you find people of all religions celebrating all the festival's. PM also has to live up to certain expectations/compulsion.. But dividing army on religious lines or showcasing his secularism on a secular forum like army should not be forced or be a point of discussion. 2 If you want to see secularism then just pick up the list of closed government holidays..

Let me share my personal experience and knowledge on this topic. I've actually been using aloe vera gel on my face for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me! Aloe vera is known for its soothing and hydrating properties, and it can work wonders for the skin. When it comes to leaving aloe vera gel on your face overnight, it really depends on your skin type and how it reacts to the gel. For some people, leaving it on overnight can be absolutely fine and beneficial. Aloe vera can help moisturize your skin, reduce redness, and even promote healing if you have any acne or blemishes. It's like a little overnight spa treatment! However, it's important to mention that everyone's skin is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. Some individuals may experience sensitivity or irritation from leaving aloe vera gel on their face for an extended period. So, it's always a good idea to do a patch test first. Apply a small amount of gel on a small area of your face and leave it overnight to see how your skin reacts. Additionally, make sure to use pure aloe vera gel without any added chemicals or fragrances. The more natural, the better! If you're unsure about the product you have, it's always helpful to check the label or consult with a dermatologist. Remember, taking care of your skin is a journey of trial and error. What works for me may not work for you, and vice versa. So, don't hesitate to listen to your skin and adjust your routine accordingly. I hope this information helps you make an informed decision. If you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask. Take care of your skin, and good luck!

They get calories into, they sustain you, if they are heated properly they can warm you a bit. However if you have them in base, or in otherwise hospitable conditions then they are awful. I had the displeasure of experiencing this first hand. I was a trainee Logistics Officer on board a ship going through pre deployment training and assessment. There was a full day of high tempo training planned, it was starting at 0600 so everybody was eating at 0500. The Logistics Officer had the idea that rather than the chefs getting up early and having to cook breakfast, and then clear up, they would feed us ration packs. Hundreds of ration packs, cooked up in vats of boiling water then passed round. They were horrific. Breakfast rations are generally eaten in the dark and cold, sticking a fork into a slightly warmed pouch and scoffing something you can't see, but which is warming you slightly. Instead we were in a brightly lit, warm cosy ship being served sausages and beans that were warmer than the surface of the sun. From what I remember we had an awful day of training. A whole bunch of tired, grumpy and now hungry sailors who couldn't perform. We should have just served bacon baps, and I'm pretty sure that's what we did from then on. You can have MRE in base but I'd avoid it. They are fair more expensive than a good meal and in nearly every example far less enjoyable."},{"instruction":"What is it like to be in a mental hospital for depression?","output":"At the point when it actually happened, it was a relief. Finally I would be somewhere with specialists taking care of me.At the same time, most of my brain had become numb by then, so the relief seemed minimal and unimportant - it faded in comparison to the buzzing and groaning and ripping going on in my mind. I was sitting in the office, rocking back and forth a little and crying, with my husband filling out the forms and helping me get through it and answer some of the questions. I felt little.I felt crushed.The depression had won. The strong, smart and successful woman had finally run out of ways to put up against a mental disorder. However, I did not feel humiliated or frustrated by the unpleasant stereotype of the term \\"psych ward\\"; I was numbly and distantly curious. After the novelty of the first day had worn off, I just reverted to being numb and stopped being interested in anything around me.What was worse, I began to be additionally irritated by the fact that I had to be present at meal times (I couldn't bear to have people around me and to look at anyone), by the fact that people were watching TV, by the fact that the walls were pale green, by the narrow windows, by the uncomfortable chairs, by the questions, by everything.

On Tuesdays we had ‚Äútonsillectomy‚Äôs‚Äù and all kinds of ENT surgeries. Being a former ED (Emergency Department) nurse I kept my certifications in ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and PALS (Pediatric Advanced life Support). The weekend before I had just completed my PALS so it was all fresh in my brain. We had about 10 cases that day and we knew we would be busy with children. All the PACU nurses get a certain number of patients as they come out of the OR. This one little, 5 year-old boy with a beautiful smile and head of blonde hair. I too had a 5 year-old blonde boy at home, so I was especially drawn to him. He wasn‚Äôt my patient and his case was the last one of the day. I noticed his Nurse continued to give him tissues as he was spitting out a lot of blood post operatively. I watched as I tended to my own patients and asked her if she thought the amount of blood was ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù About 30 mins later he threw up A LOT. It was all blood and she called me over , we quickly cleaned him comforted him and called his MD, but we couldn‚Äôt reach him. The anesthesiologist was still there and came to the bedside. The Nurse gave her report and the Dr seemed fine with the details. I quickly grabbed the Doctor and said ‚ÄúThis kid is going into shock‚Äîyou need to get the MD stat!‚Äù The MD told me I was over dramatic. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine.‚Äù We hung more IV fluids and followed the orders. I suggested calling the MD again as I wasn‚Äôt completely comfortable with what I was seeing. The doctor was at another hospital doing rounds and said he'd come ASAP. I returned to check on my patient, who was ready to be discharged. While I was outside with my patient, putting them in the car, this kid again throws up all this blood. His nurse is calling for me immediately to help her, and he‚Äôs now white as a sheet. I remember his vitals were falling and I was starting to PANIC ! The anesthesiologist comes back for the last round and now sees what I'd tried to explain, calls the MD who is enroute, he tells us to get the OR ready, and that the child has an active bleeder. We had to airlift this child to a ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Hospital.‚Äù The helicopter landed in our driveway. I never cried so hard as a nurse as that night.

A rigorous study can confidentially state correlations and suggest causation but rarely with the confidence a well designed experiment can. In theory social sciences could engage in experiments and have similar levels of confidence of conclusion but societal ethics don't allow us to conduct experiments on people and groups, fortunately. This viewpoint that social sciences aren't real science is fairly elitist and minimizes the valuable contributions that statistical analysis and models can add to knowledge and society."},{"instruction":"Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?","output":"We aren't.

Is that a good/bad thing? Hmm, may be it is a bit a both but that is another discussion altogether. Let me try to list out the reasons why we Kannadigas are least well known: Karnataka state itself is multi-lingual with significant Tulu, Konkani, Kodava, Telgu, Tamil speaking populations. Being a multi-lingual state, Kannadiga population as a percentage of state population is significantly less compared to the percentage of Tamil, Telgu, Malayali population in their respective statesKannada film industry is not as successful which is a very big reason. Again one of the reasons could be smaller market due to less Kannadiga populationThe fragmented nature of Karnataka's linguistic demography has worked against the rise of a regional political party thus denying Kannadigas the political clout enjoyed by other South Indians.Kannadigas are generally humble and do not have a tendency to blow their own trumpet. In contemporary India where the more loud and bombastic communities get widespread coverage, this becomes a liability. That said, its not a popularity contest and at the end of the day, we are all Indians. With almost all large Indian cities already being cosmopolitan and becoming more so, the day is not too far when such linguistic distinctions gradually fade away due to inter-community marriages among the different linguistic groups."},{"instruction":"Will the megacomet heading towards Earth hit Earth?","output":"C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) has been found to measure over 80 miles in diameter. For comparison‚Äôs sake, the asteroid that is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs was only around six miles wide. This one is hurting toward Earth at around 22,000 mph...of course \\"hurting toward Earth\\" is a relative term, because unless you're an amateur astronomer with a very serious set up, living in the southern hemisphere, you're incredibly unlikely to ever even get a glimpse of it, let alone see it strike the Earth! If a comet this size were to actually be headed straight for us, you'd still have very little to worry about from the comet itself, the biggest threats you'd need to worry about would likely come from fellow humans in the weeks before it hit. The comet strike itself would be of little concern as it would very likely wipe us off the surface of the planet in short order! While one day this might actually be a concern, it most certainly is not, in this case."},{"instruction":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","output":"Human activities have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last century. The majority of the gases are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels to generate energy. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around the earth, trapping energy and warming the atmosphere. We should initiate a [LINKED_TEXT: climate change awareness campaign] [URL: https://bpac.in/climate-change-winning-the-race-against-time/] across the world to take a step forward for a better earth. Over the last century, global warming has had a significant impact on the world. It refers to the unusually rapid rise in the earth's average surface temperature over the last century, which is primarily caused by greenhouse gases emitted when people burn fossil fuels. Global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions and accumulation in the earth's environment. Bright surfaces like clouds and ice reflect nearly 30% of incoming sunlight into space. The remaining 70% is absorbed by the land and ocean, followed by the atmosphere. Scientists have predicted that when global warming occurs, the following effects will occur: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea-level rise, and more intense heat waves. Scientists are confident that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, owing primarily to greenhouse gases emitted by human activities. To conclude, we must work towards combating global warming and other effects of climate change. If the earth's temperatures continue to rise in the future, living things on the planet will soon become extinct as a result of extreme heat. If humans helped in controlling global warming, the world would be cooler and the current high temperatures would be reduced. This world would be more secure to live in if everyone stood together and attempted to stop the majority of the environmental changes that are happening."},{"instruction":"w do I see who liked something on Twitter?","output":"Very simple 1.open your account 2.click on your profile 3.

Have you traveled through time to 3000 years ago and observed them !? Thirdly who cares if someone's skin has lesser or more melanin in it?! Being white or dark is not an achievement nor it is a point to be proud of, it is a gnenetical thing, if a white Nordic man comes and lives in middle eastern climate for 4 generation his offspring can be darker than he was. So who cares?! Original Persians migrated from Sibera looking for warm waters and places to farm, they resettled in the Iranian plathue, nobody knows if they were white or brown or black, as far as we can say they were smart to dig canals and farm and create an empire, later on they might have been mixed with other tribes or races but when you look at it, we humans are all originated from sahara desert, we chose to migrate and spread in different continents but the climate decide the amount melanin in our skin, it doesn't make us smarter or dumber, what makes us dumber than others is the amount of prejudice, bias and racism we hold toward others for the color of their skin."},{"instruction":"Where does all the carbon dioxide go in a submarine?","output":"It reacts to potassium superoxide in special cans and releases O2"},{"instruction":"What‚Äôs the point of the British guards (red suits and black hats)? Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","output":"Within the military ceremonial is very important, the red suit and black hat as you call it is full dress or Number 1 dress. In the British military, not only the army, tradition also plays an enormous part in the ethos and behaviour of people. A soldiers job is to project force on behalf of his government and the Guards regiments do that extremely well. But it does give a certain felling of pride and well being to march through town with bands playing whilst wearing your best suit. If ceremonial was scrapped then an army becomes nothing more than a rabble. I heard a story some years ago about a group of Paras who were fighting insurgents in a certain African ex colony, In the midst of a fire fight the Company Sergeant Major was so incensed at the behaviour of the enemy that he strode out into the open and gave them a verbal beasting as only a CSM can. He called them out of hiding and held a parade there and then in the jungle and in the vernacular ‚Äúripped them a new arsehole‚Äù for their fire discipline and standard of dress. That is what ceremonial is all about, pride. Dont be fooled by the full dress, the bayonets are sharp, the rifles are loaded and the guys are on guard are proud to be protecting Her Majesty and her family.

Well, apparently, even when the band was touring heavily and getting tons of airplay, their management was ripping them off to the point where most of the band members were broke. One of their founding members committed suicide, and several years later, after more financial struggle, another member killed himself as well. Two talented young musicians lost to the despair of having been used. When ‚ÄúBaby Blue‚Äù was used in that episode of ‚ÄúBreaking Bad‚Äù (don‚Äôt wanna spoil anything by being too specific), I just about fell off my chair, shivers running up my spine. Love that song.
